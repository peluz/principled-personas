"To find out the total number of bolts needed for a robe, we need to add the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber.

1. The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. It takes half that much white fiber, which is half of 2 bolts, so it takes 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber together:
2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

So, the total number of bolts needed for the robe is 3.

"To find out how much profit Josh made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Determine the total cost of the house including the purchase price and the repairs.
3. Subtract the total cost from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. This means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% original value + 150% increase).

The original value of the house is $80,000. So, the new value is:
\[ 80,000 \times 2.5 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the house including the purchase price and the repairs:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is:
\[ 70,000 \]"

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed needed for all the chickens for the whole day.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily requirement.

First, we calculate the total daily feed requirement for 20 chickens:
- Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day.
- For 20 chickens, the total daily feed is \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) cups.

Next, we calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups.
- The total feed given by the afternoon is \( 15 + 25 = 40 \) cups.

Finally, we find out how much feed is needed for the final meal:
- The total daily requirement is 60 cups.
- The feed already given is 40 cups.
- The feed needed for the final meal is \( 60 - 40 = 20 \) cups.

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of 16 glasses, where every second glass is sold at a 60% discount.

1. First, let's determine the cost of one glass and the discounted price of the second glass:
   - Cost of one glass: $5
   - Discounted price of the second glass: 60% of $5 = 0.60 * $5 = $3

2. Since the pattern repeats every two glasses, we can calculate the cost for two glasses:
   - Cost for two glasses: $5 + $3 = $8

3. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, which is 8 sets of two glasses:
   - Number of sets: 16 / 2 = 8

4. Now, calculate the total cost for 16 glasses:
   - Total cost: 8 sets * $8 per set = $64

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file.
2. Add the time taken for the Windows restart.
3. Add the time to download the entire file again.

First, calculate 40% of the 200 GB file:
\[ 0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB} \]

Next, calculate the time to download 80 GB at a rate of 2 GB/minute:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, add the 20 minutes for the Windows restart:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, add the time to download the entire 200 GB file again:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Total time:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \text{ minutes} \]

"First, let's calculate the distance John initially travels away from home. He drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how far he travels back home during the 4 hours. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.

For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

This means he has 1.5 hours left to drive at 80 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the distances he covers while driving back:

\[ \text{Total distance back} = 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we subtract the distance he traveled back from the initial distance he traveled away from home:

\[ \text{Distance from home} = 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.
2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there.
3. After selling at the green house, she has \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she has \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
5. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house.
6. After selling at the orange house, she has \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left, which is given as 5.

So, we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]
\[ 2x = 36 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa needs to complete the 12-mile trail to have an average speed of 4 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to determine how much time Marissa has already spent hiking:
\[ \text{Time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since she needs to complete the trail in 3 hours and has already spent 2 hours, she has:
\[ \text{Remaining time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Now, we calculate the remaining distance she needs to walk:
\[ \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - (4 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles}) = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in the remaining 1 hour:
\[ \text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"First, let's determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water:
\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

Next, since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, the remaining amount of orange drink is:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Now, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water:
\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

When the 9 liters of orange drink and 15 liters of pineapple drink are mixed, the total volume is:
\[ 9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water in the 24 liters of the mixed drink is:
\[ 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:

Now, let's add these costs together:
$12 (chicken meal) + $15 (milk) + $6 (apples) = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50. To find out how much she spent on pizza, we subtract the total cost of the other items from $50:
$50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the total amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
$17 / $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and their total age.

1. The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. This means for every 7 parts of Darrell's age, Allen's age is 11 parts.
2. Let's denote Darrell's age by \(7x\) and Allen's age by \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.
3. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   7x + 11x = 162
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   18x = 162
   \]
5. Solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x = \frac{162}{18} = 9
   \]
6. Now, calculate Darrell's and Allen's current ages:
   - Darrell's age = \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
   - Allen's age = \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)
7. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age:

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know \( S = 40 \), we can find \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To find out how many total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in each half of his ping pong session and then add them together.

1. In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.
2. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. 

To find 25% more points:
- 25% of 4 points is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \) point.
- So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) points.

Now, we add the points from both halves:
- Total points = Points in the first 20 minutes + Points in the second 20 minutes
- Total points = 4 + 5 = 9

So, the total points Mike scored is 9.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours, given the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana can run at a rate four times faster than she can walk.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - She spends one-third of the time running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - She spends two-thirds of the time walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Polly can throw the gold javelin when she is holding the sapphire gemstone and then compare this distance to the dragon's reach.

1. **Determine Polly's throwing distance without the gemstone:**
   - Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone.

2. **Determine Polly's throwing distance with the gemstone:**
   - When holding the sapphire gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther.
   - Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is \( 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \).

3. **Determine the dragon's reach:**
   - The dragon can breathe fire up to a distance of 1000 feet.

4. **Calculate how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand:**
   - Polly can throw the javelin 1200 feet.
   - The dragon's reach is 1000 feet.
   - The distance outside the dragon's reach is \( 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \).

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"First, let's determine the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips. Since there are 5 servings in the bag and each serving has 250 calories, the total number of calories in the bag is:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily target. You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories. Since each serving is 250 calories and the bag is 300g with 5 servings, each serving is:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ g}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 60 \text{ g/serving} \]

To find out how many grams of chips 200 calories represent, we use the ratio of calories to grams in a serving:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} \times 60 \text{ g/serving} = 48 \text{ g} \]

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

- The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.
- For 2 pounds, the total cost is \( 2 \text{ pounds} \times 10 \text{ dollars per pound} = 20 \text{ dollars} \).

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue.
- Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
- For 20 candles, the total revenue is \( 20 \text{ candles} \times 2 \text{ dollars per candle} = 40 \text{ dollars} \).

Step 4: Calculate the net profit.
- Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
- Net profit = \( 40 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars} \).

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice used.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she had initially from the total used to find out how many were in the package.

First, we know that Candice placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. So, she used 220 Post-it notes.

Next, we know that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining after using 220. This means the total number of Post-it notes she had before using them is:
\[ 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is:

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties:
\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so:
\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. The cost of each blue tie is $40, so:
\[ \text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + (0.5 \times 40) = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, calculate the total amount spent on red ties:
\[ \text{Total spent on red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, add the amount spent on blue ties to the amount spent on red ties to find the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year and then determine how many bags of dog food she will need.

1. Calculate the amount of dog food used in the first 180 days:
   - The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day.
   - For 180 days, the total amount of dog food is \( 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \).

2. Calculate the amount of dog food used in the remaining days of the first year:
   - A year has 365 days.
   - The remaining days after the first 180 days are \( 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \).
   - The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day for these remaining days.
   - For 185 days, the total amount of dog food is \( 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 185 \text{ days} = 370 \text{ cups} \).

3. Calculate the total amount of dog food used in the first year:
   - Total dog food = dog food for the first 180 days + dog food for the remaining 185 days
   - Total dog food = \( 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \).

4. Determine how many bags of dog food are needed:
   - Each bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
   - Number of bags needed = total dog food / cups per bag
   - Number of bags needed = \( 550 \text{ cups} / 110 \text{ cups/bag} = 5 \text{ bags} \).

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

"First, we need to determine how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Sarah's laundry} = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:

\[ 400 = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Solving for David's laundry:

\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Sarah's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Next, solve for \( L \):
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, substitute \( L = 7 \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Sylvie's monthly salary after 5 years of service.
2. Calculate the monthly salary after each of the next three years.
3. Convert the final monthly salary to an annual salary.

**Step 1: Determine Sylvie's monthly salary after 5 years of service.**

Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. After 5 years, her salary increases by 10% of the initial salary.

\[ \text{Increase} = 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]
\[ \text{New monthly salary} = 600 + 60 = 660 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the monthly salary after each of the next three years.**

Each year, her salary increases by 10% of the initial salary ($600).

- After 6 years:
  \[ \text{Increase} = 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]
  \[ \text{New monthly salary} = 660 + 60 = 720 \]

- After 7 years:
  \[ \text{Increase} = 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]
  \[ \text{New monthly salary} = 720 + 60 = 780 \]

- After 8 years:
  \[ \text{Increase} = 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]
  \[ \text{New monthly salary} = 780 + 60 = 840 \]

**Step 3: Convert the final monthly salary to an annual salary.**

\[ \text{Annual salary} = 840 \times 12 = 10080 \]

So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is:

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"To find out how many pounds of potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad that both the adult and child dinosaurs will eat.

First, let's calculate the amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adult dinosaurs.

\[ 10 \, \text{lbs/adult} \times 20 \, \text{adults} = 200 \, \text{lbs} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats 5 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 5 child dinosaurs.

\[ 5 \, \text{lbs/child} \times 5 \, \text{children} = 25 \, \text{lbs} \]

Now, we add the amounts together to find the total amount of potato salad needed:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles.
2. Calculate Gerald's improved time after his diet change.

First, we know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, and he used to be two seconds faster than Gerald. Therefore, Gerald's original time can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's time} + 2 \]
\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to find Gerald's improved time after his diet change, which improved his speed by 10%. An improvement in speed by 10% means he can run 10% faster, which translates to a 10% reduction in his time.

To find the new time, we calculate 10% of Gerald's original time and subtract it from the original time:
\[ \text{Improvement in time} = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ seconds} \]
\[ \text{Gerald's improved time} = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. So, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the original volume of tomatoes before cooking.
2. Calculate how many cans of tomatoes were used.
3. Convert the number of cans into the number of tomatoes.

First, since the volume of the tomatoes is reduced by half when cooked into sauce, the original volume of the tomatoes must have been twice the volume of the sauce. Freda made 32 ounces of sauce, so the original volume of the tomatoes was:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes were used to get 64 ounces. We do this by dividing the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:
\[ 64 \text{ ounces} \div 16 \text{ ounces/can} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Originally, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drove through in the first 15 minutes.
3. 20 more cars drove through in the next 15 minutes.
4. 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.

We need to find out how many cars drove through in the first 15 minutes.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that were originally on the motorway is 30, and 5 of them took an exit, so the number of cars that either drove through or took the exit is \( 30 - 5 = 25 \).

Therefore, the equation is:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

"To find out how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to determine the total time based on the rate at which the fog bank moves and the distance it needs to cover.

1. The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes.
2. The city is 42 miles across.

First, we calculate how many 3-mile segments are in 42 miles:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments} \]

Next, we calculate the total time to cover 14 segments, knowing that each segment takes 10 minutes:
\[ 14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to first calculate the inner dimensions of one box and then find the volume of one box. After that, we can multiply by 3 to get the total volume for all 3 boxes.

1. **Determine the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) inches
   - Inner width: \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) inches
   - Inner height: \( 4 - 2 = 2 \) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - Volume = length × width × height
   - Volume of one box = \( 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \) cubic inches

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Total volume = volume of one box × number of boxes
   - Total volume = \( 24 \times 3 = 72 \) cubic inches

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total TV watching time for each day and then solve for Wednesday.

1. **Monday**: 1 hour
2. **Tuesday**: 1 hour
3. **Wednesday**: \( x \) (30-minute episodes)
4. **Thursday**: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
5. **Friday**: 2 hours

The total time spent watching TV is 7 hours. We can set up the equation:

\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \]

Combine the constants:

\[ 5.5 + 0.5x = 7 \]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[ 0.5x = 1.5 \]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[ x = 3 \]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30-minute shows on Wednesday.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
2. This year, Henry wants to bake twice as many cookies as last year, so he plans to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
3. However, he ends up baking 15 more cookies than he planned, so he bakes \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. After baking, he drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \).
5. According to the problem, after dropping the cookies, he has 110 cookies left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 15 - 5 = 110
   \]
6. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
7. Subtract 10 from both sides:
   \[
   2x = 100
   \]
8. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 50
   \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much water Julia's boat took on while she was rowing back to shore. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total distance Julia rowed:**
   - Julia took 16 seconds to row 20 feet.
   - The shore was 64 seconds away.
   - To find the total distance, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \left(\frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of water taken on:**
   - The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.
   - For 80 feet, the amount of water taken on is:
     \[
     \text{Water taken on} = \left(\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters}

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue she makes from selling it at the new price.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- She has 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10, each costing $10.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]
- She has 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10, each costing $16.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]
- The total cost of all the lumber is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the selling price of the lumber:
- The price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards has increased by 50%, so the new price is:
  \[
  \$10 + 0.5 \times \$10 = \$10 + \$5 = \$15
  \]
- The price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards has also increased by 50%, so the new price is:
  \[
  \$16 + 0.5 \times \$16 = \$16 + \$8 = \$24
  \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:
- Revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]
- Revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]
- The total revenue is:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270
  \]

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
  \[
  \$270 - \$180 = \$90

"First, let's determine Lylah's salary four years ago. If Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

Given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ 40000 = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]
\[ 40000 = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

Solving for Lylah's salary:

\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = 30769.23 \]

Next, we calculate Adrien's salary four years later. His salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Assuming Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), we calculate her new salary:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add both their new salaries to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:

\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of the subs:
2 subs * $7.50 each = $15.00

Next, the cost of the chips:
2 bags * $1.50 each = $3.00

Then, the cost of the cookies:
2 cookies * $1.00 each = $2.00

Now, let's add these amounts to find the subtotal:
$15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we calculate the 20% delivery fee:
20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Now, we add the delivery fee to the subtotal:
$20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip:
$24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is:
$29.00

"To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he completed in the given time for each test and then subtract this from the total number of questions for each test.

First, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the first test:
- Mark's rate of completing questions is 5 questions per hour.
- He had 8 hours to complete the first test.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed in the first test is:
  \[
  5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions}
  \]
- The first test had 75 questions in total.
- The number of questions he left incomplete in the first test is:
  \[
  75 \text{ questions} - 40 \text{ questions} = 35 \text{ questions}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the second test:
- Mark's rate of completing questions is still 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the second test.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed in the second test is:
  \[
  5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ questions}
  \]
- The second test had 100 questions in total.
- The number of questions he left incomplete in the second test is:
  \[
  100 \text{ questions} - 30 \text{ questions} = 70 \text{ questions}
  \]

Finally, to find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[
35 \text{ questions} + 70 \text{ questions} = 105 \text{ questions}
\]

"To find the number of pink gumballs, we start by setting up the equation based on the information given:

1. Let \( B \) represent the number of blue gumballs.
2. According to the problem, there are 12 blue gumballs, so \( B = 12 \).
3. The number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. Let \( P \) represent the number of pink gumballs.
4. The relationship can be expressed as: \( P = 4B + 22 \).

Now, substitute \( B = 12 \) into the equation:

\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, the number of pink gumballs is 70.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many semi-automatic cars there are. 

We know there are 20 cars in total:
- 12 are automatic
- 4 are manual

The rest are semi-automatic. So, we calculate the number of semi-automatic cars as follows:
20 (total cars) - 12 (automatic cars) - 4 (manual cars) = 4 (semi-automatic cars)

Next, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let the number of queens be \( Q \).
2. Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, the number of baby bees is \( 2Q \).
3. Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the queens, baby bees, and worker bees:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

Solve for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]

Now, we can find the number of worker bees:
\[ 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is 400.

"First, let's identify the items and their costs:
- Milk: $2 (food)
- Eggs: $3 (food)
- Light bulbs: $3 (nonfood)
- Cups: $3 (nonfood)
- Roach traps: $4 (nonfood)

Next, calculate the total cost of food items:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
Total food cost = $2 + $3 = $5

Now, calculate the total cost of nonfood items:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
Total nonfood cost = $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Calculate the tax on nonfood items (10% of $10):
Tax = 10% of $10 = 0.10 * $10 = $1

Add the tax to the total nonfood cost:
Total nonfood cost with tax = $10 + $1 = $11

Finally, add the total food cost and the total nonfood cost with tax:
Total cost = Total food cost + Total nonfood cost with tax
Total cost = $5 + $11 = $16

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home and then find the difference in their travel times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet, since the speeds are given in feet per minute.

1 mile = 5280 feet

- Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

- Steve's time: 
  \[
  \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- Tim's time: 
  \[
  \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in their travel times to determine how long the winner will be waiting.

\[
\text{Difference} = 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}

"To find out how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost for inflating the tires of the bicycles, tricycles, and the unicycle.

1. **Bicycles**: Each bicycle has 2 tires. If 5 people came by to get both tires inflated, that's \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
2. **Tricycles**: Each tricycle has 3 tires. If 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated, that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
3. **Unicycle**: A unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person came by to get the tire inflated, that's \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Now, we add up all the tires:
\[10 \text{ (bicycle tires)} + 9 \text{ (tricycle tires)} + 1 \text{ (unicycle tire)} = 20 \text{ tires}\]

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents per tire} = 500 \text{ cents}\]

Since 100 cents make a dollar, we convert 500 cents to dollars:
\[500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}\]

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many fries were in the pack initially.

1. **Dave's fries**: Dave ate 14 fries.
2. **Seagull's fries**: The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. **Pigeons' fries**: Each of the three pigeons ate 3 fries, so \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries were eaten by the pigeons.
4. **Raccoon's fries**: After the seagull and pigeons, the remaining fries were eaten by the raccoon. Let's denote the total number of fries initially as \( x \). After Dave, the seagull, and the pigeons, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 - 7 - 9 = x - 30 \). The raccoon ate two-thirds of these remaining fries, so the raccoon ate \( \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) \) fries.
5. **Ants' fries**: The ants carried off 1 fry.
6. **Remaining fries**: After all these events, 5 fries were left.

We can set up the equation based on the remaining fries:
\[ x - 14 - 7 - 9 - \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x - 30 - \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5 \]
\[ x - 30 - \frac{2}{3}x + 20 - 1 = 5 \]
\[ x - \frac{2}{3}x - 11 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3}x - 11 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3}x = 16 \]
\[ x = 48 \]

So, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 48.

"To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in class each week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- He has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long.
- Therefore, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours each of these days.

Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total hours for these days is:
\[3 \times 3 = 9\] hours.

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- He has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long.
- Therefore, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours each of these days.

Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total hours for these days is:
\[2 \times 4 = 8\] hours.

Now, let's add the hours from all the days to find the total number of hours Kimo spends in class each week:

"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the miles he walks on weekdays and the miles he walks on weekends, and then add them together.

1. Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the total miles walked from Monday to Friday is:
   \[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

2. On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day. So, the total miles walked on the weekend is:
   \[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

3. Adding the miles from weekdays and weekends gives us the total miles walked in a week:
   \[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the hat**: The hat costs $25.
2. **Cost of the jacket**: The jacket costs three times as much as the hat. Therefore, the cost of the jacket is:
   \[
   3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the pants**: The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as:
   \[
   \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

"To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to first determine how many gallons of lemonade they sold.

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade:
   - They made a profit of $25.
   - The cost to make one gallon of lemonade is $3 (lemons) + $2 (sugar) = $5.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of gallons they made and sold.
   - The revenue from selling \( x \) gallons is \( 20x \) glasses at $0.50 per glass, which equals \( 20x \times 0.50 = 10x \) dollars.

2. Calculate the profit:
   - Profit is revenue minus cost.
   - \( 10x - 5x = 25 \)
   - Simplify the equation: \( 5x = 25 \)
   - Solve for \( x \): \( x = 5 \) gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Zaid's expenses step by step and then determine how much money he has left.

1. **Calculate the amount spent on rent:**
   Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:**
   Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount donated to charity:**
   Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining amount after the donation:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount after donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total amount given to his daughter and wife:**
   Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of white carnations first, and then use that to find the number of red roses Sandra ordered.

1. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( C \).
2. According to the problem, the number of pink calla lilies is 200, and this is five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   200 = 5C
   \]
3. Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = \frac{200}{5} = 40
   \]
   So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.
4. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses \( R \) is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the ages:**
   - Jan's age is given as 30.
   - Let Mark's current age be \( M \).
   - Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is \( M + 2 \).

2. **Set up the equation based on the information given:**
   - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
   - According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.

3. **Formulate the equation:**
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago is \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
   - Mark's age two years ago was 5 years older than 14, so:
     \[
     M - 2 = 14 + 5
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     M - 2 = 19
     \]
   - Solve for \( M \):
     \[
     M = 19 + 2
     \]
     \[
     M = 21
     \]

4. **Determine Jean's age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark, so:
     \[
     \text{Jean's age} = M + 2 = 21 + 2 = 23
     \]

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

Each member of the well-rounded team runs their 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are 4 members, the total time for the well-rounded team is:
\[ 4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

### Less Well-Rounded Team:
The less well-rounded team has different times for each runner:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

The total time for the less well-rounded team is:
\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

### Difference in Times:
The well-rounded team finishes in 220 seconds, and the less well-rounded team finishes in 222 seconds. The difference in their times is:
\[ 222 - 220 = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

The faster team will win by 2 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).
   - Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \).

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.
   - To find how much more likely the first event is compared to the second, we calculate the ratio of the probabilities and then convert it to a percentage:
     \[
     \text{Ratio} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
     \]
   - This means the first event is 2 times more likely than the second event.
   - To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
     \[
     2 \times 100 = 200\%
     \]

Therefore, it is 200% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To find out how many rats are in each cage, let's break down the information given:

1. **Total pieces of straw distributed:** 160 pieces
2. **Straw for hamsters:** 10 cages * 5 pieces per hamster = 50 pieces
3. **Straw for rabbits:** 20 pieces
4. **Straw for rats:** Total straw - (Straw for hamsters + Straw for rabbits) = 160 - (50 + 20) = 90 pieces

Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \). Since there are 3 cages, the total number of rats is \( 3r \).

The total straw for the rats is:
\[ 3r \times 6 = 90 \]

Solving for \( r \):
\[ 18r = 90 \]
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} \]
\[ r = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

"To find out how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is invested or borrowed for.

Given:
- \( P = 100 \) dollars
- \( r = 2\% = 0.02 \)
- \( n = 3 \) months

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ A = 100 (1 + 0.02)^3 \]

First, calculate \( 1 + 0.02 \):

\[ 1 + 0.02 = 1.02 \]

Next, raise 1.02 to the power of 3:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Cost of buying the bags**: The trader buys each bag for $20.
2. **Transport cost per bag**: It costs $2 to transport each bag.
3. **Total cost per bag**: The total cost for each bag is $20 (buying) + $2 (transport) = $22.
4. **Selling price per bag**: The trader sells each bag for $30.
5. **Profit per bag**: The profit for each bag is $30 (selling price) - $22 (total cost) = $8.
6. **Total profit**: The trader made a total profit of $400.

To find the number of bags sold, we use the total profit and the profit per bag:

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate the total payment from both publishers.

1. First, we know that Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher. Since he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

2. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, for 500 sentences, Publisher A pays:
   \[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

3. Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays per sentence. Therefore, Publisher B pays:
   \[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
   For 500 sentences, Publisher B pays:
   \[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

4. To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the payments from both publishers:

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day.
2. The white chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

We can set up the equation for the total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substitute \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the total distance he walks, which is the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. He walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time taken to walk a certain distance is given by:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Step 3: The total number of customers over the three days is 500. We need to find the number of customers on the third day. Let's denote the number of customers on the third day as \( x \). The equation for the total number of customers over the three days is:
\[ 100 + 150 + x = 500 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 250 + x = 500 \]
\[ x = 500 - 250 \]
\[ x = 250 \]

So, the number of customers on the third day is 250.

"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as \( S \) gallons. Therefore, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago was \( 2S \) gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, in 4 minutes, each pool has lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons of water.

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S - 16 \) gallons, and the current amount of water in the big pool is \( 2S - 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2S - 16 = 4(S - 16) \]

Now, let's solve for \( S \):
\[ 2S - 16 = 4S - 64 \]
\[ 2S - 4S = -64 + 16 \]
\[ -2S = -48 \]
\[ S = 24 \]

So, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had 24 gallons of water. The current amount of water in the small pool is:
\[ S - 16 = 24 - 16 = 8 \]

Thus, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To find out how many penguins are still left sunbathing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of penguins that jump in and swim in the ocean.
2. Calculate the number of penguins that go inside the cave to eat their dinner.
3. Subtract the total number of penguins that left from the original number of penguins.

First, we calculate one-third of the 36 penguins:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

So, 12 penguins jump in and swim in the ocean, and another 12 penguins go inside the cave to eat their dinner.

Next, we add the number of penguins that left:
\[ 12 + 12 = 24 \]

Finally, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the original number:
\[ 36 - 24 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of tomatoes Steve eats per week:**
   - Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, Steve eats \( 6 \times 7 = 42 \) tomatoes per week.

2. **Determine the total number of tomatoes Steve and his girlfriend eat together per week:**
   - Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of tomatoes his girlfriend eats per week.
   - Therefore, \( 2x \) is the number of tomatoes Steve eats per week.
   - We already know Steve eats 42 tomatoes per week, so \( 2x = 42 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 21 \).
   - So, his girlfriend eats 21 tomatoes per week.
   - Together, they eat \( 42 + 21 = 63 \) tomatoes per week.

3. **Determine the number of vines needed:**
   - Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.
   - To find the number of vines needed, divide the total number of tomatoes by the number of tomatoes each vine produces:
   - \( \frac{63}{3} = 21 \).

So, Steve needs 21 vines.

"First, let's determine how many pen pals Mike still has:
- Mike originally had 5 pen pals.
- He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
- So, he now has \(5 - 2 = 3\) pen pals.

Next, let's calculate the number of letters he receives each week:
- Each of his 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week.
- Therefore, he receives \(3 \times 2 = 6\) letters a week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he receives each week is:
- \(6 \times 5 = 30\) pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages each week.

Now, let's determine how long it takes him to write these pages:
- He can write 1 page every 6 minutes.
- Therefore, to write 30 pages, it takes \(30 \times 6 = 180\) minutes.

Finally, we convert the time spent writing from minutes to hours:
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- So, \(180 \div 60 = 3\) hours.

Thus, Mike spends 3 hours writing each week.

   - Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000
   - Transfer fees = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   - Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000
   - Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000

3. **Calculate the total expenses:**
   - Total expenses = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee + Remaining loan amount
   - Total expenses = $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000 = $282,000

4. **Calculate the net proceeds:**
   - Net proceeds = Selling price - Total expenses
   - Net proceeds = $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Time to heat oil to 300 degrees:**
   - It takes 20 minutes.

2. **Time to heat oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees:**
   - It takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \( 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat from 300 to 400 degrees is \( 20 + 8 = 28 \) minutes.

3. **Total time to heat the oil:**
   - Time to heat to 300 degrees + Time to heat from 300 to 400 degrees
   - \( 20 + 28 = 48 \) minutes.

4. **Time to cook the chicken:**
   - It takes 5 minutes less than the time it took to warm up the oil.
   - \( 48 - 5 = 43 \) minutes.

5. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:**
   - Time to heat the oil + Time to cook the chicken
   - \( 48 + 43 = 91 \) minutes.

The final numerical answer is:
91"

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, let's break down the information given:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body, so it takes \(900 / 10 = 90\) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes \(90 \times 2 = 180\) stitches.
4. The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 \text{ (body)} + 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 1170 \text{ stitches} \]

The remaining stitches are for the two sleeves:
\[ 1800 \text{ (total)} - 1170 \text{ (body, collar, rosette)} = 630 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches per sleeve is:
\[ 630 \text{ stitches} / 2 = 315 \text{ stitches} \]

Each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To find out how much John pays a year for the driving service, we need to calculate the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus given to the driver.

1. **Calculate the total miles driven in a year:**
   - John travels 30 miles to work and 30 miles back each day, so he travels 60 miles per day.
   - He works 5 days a week, so he travels \(60 \times 5 = 300\) miles per week.
   - He works 50 weeks a year, so he travels \(300 \times 50 = 15,000\) miles per year.

2. **Calculate the cost of the miles driven:**
   - He gets charged $2 per mile, so the cost for the miles driven is \(15,000 \times 2 = 30,000\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total bonus given to the driver:**
   - He gives a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is \(150 \times 12 = 1,800\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total annual cost:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus, which is \(30,000 + 1,800 = 31,800\) dollars.

Therefore, John pays $31,800 a year for the driving service.

"To find out how much money Elise earned in the second year, we need to determine how many books she sold in each year and then calculate the earnings for the second year.

1. **Determine the number of books sold in the current year:**
   - The current year's sales are given as 45 books.

2. **Determine the number of books sold in the first year:**
   - She sold twice as many books in the first year as in the current year.
   - First year's sales = 2 * 45 = 90 books.

3. **Determine the total number of books sold over the three years:**
   - Total books initially = 250 books.
   - Unsold books = 50 books.
   - Books sold = 250 - 50 = 200 books.

4. **Determine the number of books sold in the second year:**
   - Books sold in the first year = 90 books.
   - Books sold in the current year = 45 books.
   - Books sold in the second year = Total books sold - (Books sold in the first year + Books sold in the current year)
   - Books sold in the second year = 200 - (90 + 45) = 200 - 135 = 65 books.

5. **Calculate the earnings for the second year:**
   - Each book sells for $20.

"To find out how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from both his hourly wage and his weekly bonus, considering the company performed very well for the whole month.

1. **Calculate the number of working days in April:**
   - April typically has 30 days.
   - Watson works 5 days a week.
   - There are 4 full weeks in April, plus 2 extra days (since 30 days / 7 days per week = 4 weeks and 2 days).
   - Therefore, Watson works 4 weeks * 5 days/week + 2 days = 22 days in April.

2. **Calculate Watson's earnings from his hourly wage:**
   - Watson works 10 hours each day.
   - He earns $10 per hour.
   - Total hours worked in April = 22 days * 10 hours/day = 220 hours.
   - Total earnings from hourly wage = 220 hours * $10/hour = $2200.

3. **Calculate Watson's weekly bonus:**
   - Watson gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.
   - There are 4 weeks in April.
   - Total bonus for April = 4 weeks * $300/week = $1200.

4. **Calculate Watson's total earnings for April:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from hourly wage + Total bonus
   - Total earnings = $2200 + $1200 = $3400.

Therefore, Watson made $3400 in April.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, determine how much weight Joey loses in one week:
   Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so in one week, Joey loses:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

2. Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

3. To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we need to calculate how many 4-week periods are required for her to lose 8 pounds:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per 4 weeks}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \times 4 = 16 \text{ weeks}
   \]

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"To find out how much you will save, we need to calculate the total savings from the discounts on the ice cream and the milk.

First, calculate the savings on the ice cream:
- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- New price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Since you are buying 2 tubs of ice cream:
- Total savings on ice cream: 2 * $2 = $4

Next, calculate the savings on the milk:
- Discount per packet of milk: $0.5
- Number of packets of milk: 4
- Total savings on milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2

Now, add the total savings from both the ice cream and the milk:
- Total savings: $4 (ice cream) + $2 (milk) = $6

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Currently, Cera is 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, Noah is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age.
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60,000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half what it is now.

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{1}{2}D \) players.

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]

To combine the terms, convert \( 3D \) to a fraction with a common denominator:
\[ \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{1D}{2} = 105 \]
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness, which is 8 people.

Then, we calculate the number of people who had previous commitments, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \]

So, the total number of people who couldn't attend is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, we subtract the number of people who couldn't attend from the total number of people invited:
\[ 24 - 10 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is 14.

"To find the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost of each offer and then subtract the smaller total from the larger total.

First, let's calculate the total cost of Furniture United's offer:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost for Furniture United: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Next, let's calculate the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost for Cozy Homes: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, we find the cost difference:
- Cost difference: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

"To find out how much sugar Mason needs, we can break the problem into two parts:

1. Calculate the amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers.
2. Calculate the amount of sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge.

First, for the suckers:
- Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for one batch of suckers.
- For 8 batches, he will need \( 30 \times 8 = 240 \) ounces of sugar.

Next, for the fudge:
- Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar for one batch of fudge.
- For 1 batch, he will need \( 70 \times 1 = 70 \) ounces of sugar.

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total sugar needed:
- Total sugar needed = 240 ounces (for suckers) + 70 ounces (for fudge) = 310 ounces.

So, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar in total.

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group, therefore, has \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Add 10 to both sides:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

The number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( C \) represent the number of cows.
   - Let \( H \) represent the number of chickens.

2. **Set up the equations based on the information given:**
   - The total number of animals is 60, so:
     \[
     C + H = 60
     \]
   - There are twice as many chickens as cows, so:
     \[
     H = 2C
     \]

3. **Substitute the second equation into the first equation:**
   \[
   C + 2C = 60
   \]
   \[
   3C = 60
   \]

4. **Solve for \( C \):**
   \[
   C = \frac{60}{3} = 20
   \]

5. **Find the number of chickens:**
   \[
   H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

6. **Calculate the total number of legs:**
   - Each cow has 4 legs, so the total number of legs for the cows is:
     \[
     20 \times 4 = 80
     \]
   - Each chicken has 2 legs, so the total number of legs for the chickens is:
     \[
     40 \times 2 = 80
     \]

7. **Add the legs together:**
   \[
   80 + 80 = 160
   \]

So, the total number of legs for all the animals is 160.

"To find out how much milk Mary collects every day, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. **Milk from the first half of the sheep:**
   - Mary has 30 sheep in total.
   - Half of them is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) sheep.
   - Each of these 15 sheep gives 1 kg of milk.
   - So, the total milk from the first half is \( 15 \times 1 = 15 \) kg.

2. **Milk from the second half of the sheep:**
   - The other half is also 15 sheep.
   - Each of these 15 sheep gives 2 kg of milk.
   - So, the total milk from the second half is \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) kg.

Now, we add the milk from both halves to get the total amount of milk collected every day:

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up the problem as follows:

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]
\[ x = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls:

Number of boys = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26
Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

The performance is only with the female members, so initially, there are 26 girls performing.

On the day of the performance, half of the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can make it is:

Number of girls who can make it = 0.5 * 26 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total people who sang = Number of girls who can make it + Number of teachers
Total people who sang = 13 + 3 = 16

"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to determine how many popsicles each of them has based on the given ratio and total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have 5 + 6 = 11 parts of the total number of popsicles.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find out how many popsicles each part represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

"To find out how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily energy usage before reduction:**
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour.
   - Mel uses it for 8 hours a day.
   - Daily energy usage = 900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watts/day.

2. **Convert daily energy usage to kilowatts:**
   - 1 kilowatt (kW) = 1000 watts.
   - Daily energy usage in kilowatts = 7200 watts / 1000 = 7.2 kW/day.

3. **Calculate the daily energy usage after reduction:**
   - Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, so he uses the air conditioner for 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day.
   - Daily energy usage after reduction = 900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watts/day.
   - Daily energy usage in kilowatts after reduction = 2700 watts / 1000 = 2.7 kW/day.

4. **Calculate the daily energy savings:**
   - Daily energy savings = 7.2 kW/day - 2.7 kW/day = 4.5 kW/day.

5. **Calculate the total energy savings over 30 days:**
   - Total energy savings = 4.5 kW/day * 30 days = 135 kW.

So, the total energy savings in 30 days is 135 kW.

"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

1. Calculate the total number of stripes:
   - Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\)
   - One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\)
   - One zebra with half as many stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(\frac{36}{2} = 18\)

   Adding these together gives the total number of stripes:
   \[
   34 + 36 + 18 = 88
   \]

2. Calculate the average number of stripes:
   - There are 4 zebras in total.
   - The average number of stripes is the total number of stripes divided by the number of zebras:
   \[
   \frac{88}{4} = 22

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many muffaletta sandwiches Tyson needs to make to serve 20 people, and then calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese required.

1. **Determine the number of sandwiches needed:**
   - Each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - There are 20 people in total.
   - Number of sandwiches needed = Total number of people / Number of people served per sandwich
   - Number of sandwiches needed = 20 / 4 = 5 sandwiches

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of meat needed = 5 pounds
   - For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of cheese needed = 5 pounds

3. **Calculate the total cost of the meat:**
   - Cost of meat per pound = $7.00
   - Total cost of meat = 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

4. **Calculate the total cost of the cheese:**
   - Cost of cheese per pound = $3.00
   - Total cost of cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

5. **Calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese:**
   - Total cost = Total cost of meat + Total cost of cheese
   - Total cost = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people is:

"First, let's determine the initial number of corns and cannolis at Allan's house.

1. Allan has 40 cannolis.
2. There is twice as much corn as cannolis, so the number of corns is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

Next, Allan buys more cannolis and corns:
3. He buys 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).
4. He buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he now has, so the number of corns he buys is \(100 - 40 = 60\).

Now, let's find the new total number of corns:
5. The new total number of corns is \(80 + 60 = 140\).

Finally, we find the combined total of corns and cannolis:
6. The combined total is \(140 + 100 = 240\).

"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he has done 5,000 steps. He also did another 1,000 steps walking with his friend. So, before his jog, he had completed:

5,000 steps (to and from school) + 1,000 steps (with his friend) = 6,000 steps

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. This means that before his jog, he had:

10,000 steps (goal) - 2,000 steps (left) = 8,000 steps

Therefore, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is:

8,000 steps (before jog) - 6,000 steps (before jog) = 2,000 steps

"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:
45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Next, we calculate how long it will take Toby to read the book:
9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes 10 minutes to get there, so he needs to leave 10 minutes before his 60-minute deadline:
60 minutes - 10 minutes = 50 minutes

Since Toby will finish reading the book in 30 minutes, we can calculate how many minutes early he will be:
50 minutes - 30 minutes = 20 minutes

"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees who continued working in June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Add the payments for May and June to get the total amount paid over the two months.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per week: 40
- Weeks in a month: 4 (assuming a standard 4-week month)

Total payment for one employee in May:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in May:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 40 \, \text{employees} = 96000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees who continued working in June.**

- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June.
- Number of employees whose contracts expired: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)
- Number of employees who continued working in June: \( 40 - 10 = 30 \)

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

Total payment for one employee in June:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in June:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 30 \, \text{employees} = 72000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 4: Add the payments for May and June to get the total amount paid over the two months.**

Total payment for May and June:
\[ 96000 \, \text{dollars} + 72000 \, \text{dollars} = 168000 \, \text{dollars} \]

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means the first pound costs $3 and the second pound costs half of $3, which is $1.50.

So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells:
\[ 1.50 \]

Then, let's calculate the cost of the 4 magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, so:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from $10:
\[ 10 - 7.00 = 3.00 \]

So, Sally has $3.00 left.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of candles that are expected to explode.
2. Determine the number of candles that are both expected to explode and have the wet dog smell defect.

First, we know that Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode. This means that 1% of the candles are expected to explode.

1% of 50,000 candles:
\[ 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \text{ candles} \]

Next, we know that 5% of the more dangerous (exploding) candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

5% of 500 candles:

"Let's break down the information given in the problem step by step.

1. **Joanne's Apples:**
   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples.
   - From the shortest trees: \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
   - From the average trees: Let's call this number \( x \).

2. **Sister's Apples:**
   - From the tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
   - From the shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
   - From the average trees: 0 apples.

3. **Total Apples Gathered:**
   - Joanne's total: \( 30 + 15 + x \).
   - Sister's total: \( 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \).

4. **Combined Total:**
   - Combined total of apples gathered by both: \( (30 + 15 + x) + 105 = 500 \).

Now, let's set up the equation and solve for \( x \):

\[
30 + 15 + x + 105 = 500
\]

\[
150 + x = 500
\]

\[
x = 500 - 150

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of heads (camels + dromedaries) is 180.
2. The total number of humps (2 for each camel + 1 for each dromedary) is 304.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the number of camels.
- \( D \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (total number of humps)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( C \):
\[ C = 180 - D \]

Next, substitute \( C \) in the second equation:
\[ 2(180 - D) + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 2D + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - D = 304 \]
\[ -D = 304 - 360 \]
\[ -D = -56 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \)

2. **Next 2 days**: Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled over the first four days.
   - 30% of 800 km: \( 0.30 \times 800 \, \text{km} = 240 \, \text{km} \)
   - Total distance for the next 2 days: \( 240 \, \text{km} \)

3. **Next 1 day**: Tom didn't travel at all.
   - Total distance for this day: \( 0 \, \text{km} \)

4. **Second week (7 days)**: Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \)

Now, we add up all the distances:
- First 4 days: 800 km
- Next 2 days: 240 km
- Next 1 day: 0 km
- Second week: 2100 km

Total distance traveled:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \]

"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the elevation where the comb landed.
2. Calculate the difference between Oliver's current elevation and the comb's elevation.

First, we know Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet. So, the comb landed at:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

So, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars, came from the tattered jeans.

4. **Calculate the original prices of the jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans were bought for $28 and saved $4, so the original price of the tattered jeans was \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The jogger jeans were bought for $22 and saved $2, so the original price of the jogger jeans was \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans. However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, which is a negative value in this context. The correct interpretation is that the tattered jeans originally cost $8 more than the jogger jeans.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - Therefore, he prepared 18 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 36 hotdogs for the second hotdogs.
   - Additionally, he prepared 1 hotdog for each of the remaining 18 guests.
   - Total hotdogs prepared = 36 (for second hotdogs) + 18 (for first hotdogs) = 54 hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Total hotdogs needed = 40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only had 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short = 80 (needed) - 54 (prepared) = 26 hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest wanted a second hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is equal to the number of hotdogs short.
   - Therefore, 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

"First, we need to determine how many gallons of gas are in one container. Since 15 gallons are equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

15 gallons ÷ 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so we calculate 1/4 of 3 gallons:

3 gallons × 1/4 = 0.75 gallons

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we convert 0.75 gallons to pints:

0.75 gallons × 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount George spent:**
   - George had 1% of his money left, which means he spent 99% of his money.
   - If $5 is 100% of his money, then 99% of his money is \( 0.99 \times 5 = 4.95 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the chips:**
   - George bought 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents.
   - The total cost for the chips is \( 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the amount spent on candy bars:**
   - The total amount spent is $4.95.
   - The amount spent on chips is $1.20.
   - The amount spent on candy bars is \( 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the number of candy bars:**
   - Each candy bar costs 75 cents, or $0.75.
   - The number of candy bars George bought is \( \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \).

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the length from yards to feet**: Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
   \[
   3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Determine the width of the room**: We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
   \]
   Plugging in the known values:
   \[
   360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width}
   \]
   Solving for the width:
   \[
   \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the perimeter of the room**: The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought and then find the difference between these totals.

1. **Calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought:**
   - Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
   - Each pack contains 20 beads.
   - Total beads Elizabeth bought = (1 pack of red + 2 packs of clear) * 20 beads per pack
   - Total beads Elizabeth bought = (1 + 2) * 20 = 3 * 20 = 60 beads

2. **Calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought:**
   - Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
   - Each pack contains 20 beads.
   - Total beads Margareth bought = (3 packs of blue + 4 packs of red) * 20 beads per pack
   - Total beads Margareth bought = (3 + 4) * 20 = 7 * 20 = 140 beads

3. **Find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters:**
   - Difference = Total beads Margareth bought - Total beads Elizabeth bought
   - Difference = 140 - 60 = 80 beads

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time it takes James to complete the swim is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, the time it takes James to complete the bike ride is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time it takes James to complete the run. According to the problem, Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

"First, let's figure out how far the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

1 hour = 60 minutes, so 30 minutes is half an hour.

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 32 miles/hour × 0.5 hours = 16 miles

Next, we calculate how much hay the horse will eat for running 16 miles.

For every mile, the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay.
For 16 miles, the horse will eat 16 × 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Now, let's find out the cost of 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3.
So, 8 bails of hay will cost 8 × $3 = $24.

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which means he has 6 × $5 = $30.

To find out how much change Michael will have after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of the hay from the amount of money he has.

Change = $30 - $24 = $6

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of sheets per room:**
   Each room has 2 sheets.

2. **Determine the number of comforters per room:**
   Each room has 1 comforter.

3. **Determine the number of pillow cases per room:**
   Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets. Since there are 2 sheets, there are:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ pillow cases}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of towels per room:**
   Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases. Since there are 4 pillow cases, there are:
   \[
   2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ towels}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of pieces of laundry per room:**
   Each room has:
   \[
   2 \text{ sheets} + 1 \text{ comforter} + 4 \text{ pillow cases} + 8 \text{ towels} = 15 \text{ pieces of laundry}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total number of pieces of laundry for 80 rooms:**

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Frank starts with 200 shoes.
2. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since 1 pair = 2 shoes, 5 pairs = 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
   - Total shoes after Monday: 200 + 10 = 210 shoes.
3. On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs of shoes. 15 pairs = 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
   - Total shoes after Wednesday: 210 + 30 = 240 shoes.
4. On Friday, he gains 30 pairs of shoes. 30 pairs = 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.
   - Total shoes after Friday: 240 + 60 = 300 shoes.
5. On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.
   - Total shoes after Saturday: 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

So, on Sunday, Frank will have 120 shoes.

"To find out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set the equation equal to 5:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we will convert the remoras' lengths from inches to feet.
2. Calculate the total length of the remoras.
3. Determine the percentage of the shark's length that the remoras' total length represents.

First, convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet:
- Each remora is 6 inches long.
- There are 12 inches in a foot, so 6 inches is \( \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \) feet.

Since there are 2 remoras, the total length of the remoras is:
- \( 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \) foot.

Next, calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras' total length represents:
- The shark is 10 feet long.
- The remoras are 1 foot long in total.

The percentage is calculated as:
\[ \left( \frac{\text{Total length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

\[
\frac{1}{4}T = 20
\]

To find \( T \), we can solve for \( T \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
T = 20 \times 4
\]

\[
T = 80

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

1. First, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts:
   - Kids allergic to dairy: 9
   - Kids allergic to peanuts: 6
   - Total: 9 + 6 = 15

2. However, this total includes the kids who are allergic to both dairy and peanuts twice, so we need to subtract the number of kids allergic to both:
   - Kids allergic to both: 3
   - Adjusted total: 15 - 3 = 12

This means 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

3. To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids who are allergic to something from the total number of kids in the class:
   - Total kids in the class: 32
   - Kids not allergic to anything: 32 - 12 = 20

So, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is 20.

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( x \).

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Cost of food per guest: $5
- Total cost at the first venue: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest (including food): $25
- Total cost at the second venue: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of the skein they each used and then convert that to yards.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. First, we add these fractions:

\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

So, together they used \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein of yarn.

Next, we need to convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein into yards. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

Therefore, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.
2. She bought 2 packs of strawberry gum.
3. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum.
4. She paid half as much for a pack of green apple gum, which means she paid $2 / 2 = $1 for the green apple gum.
5. The total amount she paid for all the gum is $7.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the grape and green apple gums:
- Grape gum: $2
- Green apple gum: $1
- Total for grape and green apple gums: $2 + $1 = $3

Since the total amount paid is $7, the amount spent on the strawberry gum is:
- Total amount - Amount spent on grape and green apple gums = $7 - $3 = $4

Since she bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, the cost per pack of strawberry gum is:
- Total cost of strawberry gum / Number of packs = $4 / 2 = $2

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of cows on the farm**: 30 cows
2. **Number of sheep on the zoo**: 20 sheep

Next, we need to verify the given conditions:
- The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
  - Number of cows on the zoo = 2 * Number of cows on the farm
  - Number of cows on the zoo = 2 * 30 = 60 cows

- The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.
  - Number of sheep on the farm = 0.5 * Number of sheep on the zoo
  - Number of sheep on the farm = 0.5 * 20 = 10 sheep

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals on both the farm and the zoo:
- **Total animals on the farm**: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
- **Total animals on the zoo**: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Finally, add the total number of animals on the farm and the zoo:
- **Combined total**: 40 animals (farm) + 80 animals (zoo) = 120 animals

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days Andy has to reach his goal.
2. Determine the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.
3. Calculate the daily calorie deficit required to achieve this goal.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days.**

From December 31st to July 19th, we need to count the days in each month:
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July: 19 days (up to the 19th)

Adding these together:
31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

**Step 2: Determine the total number of calories to burn.**

Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound. To lose 30 pounds:
30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

**Step 3: Calculate the daily calorie deficit.**

To find the daily calorie deficit, divide the total calories by the number of days:
105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories/day

"Let's start by defining the variables and understanding the relationships given in the problem.

1. Let \( C_O \) represent the number of chairs Ophelia has.
2. Let \( S_O \) represent the number of sofas Ophelia has.
3. Let \( C_J \) represent the number of chairs Jenna has.
4. Let \( S_J \) represent the number of sofas Jenna has.

From the problem, we know:
- Ophelia has 20 sofas: \( S_O = 20 \).
- Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_O = C_O - 2 \).

Using the information that \( S_O = 20 \):
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Next, we know:
- Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia: \( C_J = 3 \times C_O \).

Substituting \( C_O = 22 \):
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 = 64 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together:
- Total sofas: \( S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \)
- Total chairs: \( C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \)

Adding these together gives the total number of sofas and chairs:

"To find out how much one monitor costs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the cost of the computer, which is given as $1,100.
2. Determine the cost of the printer. Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, we calculate the printer's cost as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cost of printer} = \text{Cost of computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700
   \]
3. Calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of computer and printer} = 1100 + 700 = 1800
   \]
4. Subtract the total cost of the computer and printer from the total amount spent to find the total cost of the 2 monitors:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of 2 monitors} = 2400 - 1800 = 600
   \]
5. Divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor:
   \[
   \text{Cost of one monitor} = \frac{600}{2} = 300
   \]

Thus, the cost of one monitor is $300.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of boys and girls:**
   - There are 20 kids in total.
   - They are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys.
   - Therefore, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

2. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by each boy:**
   - Each boy brought back 60 shells.

3. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by each girl:**
   - Each girl brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.
   - This can be expressed as: \( 60 + 4 \times 60 \).

4. **Perform the calculation:**
   - \( 60 + 4 \times 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 \).

So, each girl brought back 300 seashells.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125.

1. **Determine the number of days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Set up the relationship between the savings in the first and second halves:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half.
   - He saves twice as much each day in the second half, so he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half.

4. **Calculate the total savings for each half:**
   - Total savings in the first half: \( 15x \)
   - Total savings in the second half: \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)

5. **Set up the equation for the total monthly savings:**
   - Total savings for the month: \( 15x + 30x = 45x \)

6. **Set the total savings equal to the target and solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   45x = 1125
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45}
   \]
   \[
   x = 25

"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. So, twice this time is:
\[ 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding 2 minutes to this time gives:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water.

For cold water:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water:

2. Calculate the total number of roses the flower shops order in a month.
3. Find the difference between the total number of roses ordered and the total number of roses grown.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month
Ford grows 40 roses every week. There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.

\[
40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 160 \text{ roses/month}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of roses the flower shops order in a month
The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week, the second orders 15 roses per week, and the third orders 30 roses per week.

\[
20 \text{ roses/week} + 15 \text{ roses/week} + 30 \text{ roses/week} = 65 \text{ roses/week}
\]

Now, calculate the total number of roses ordered in a month:

\[
65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 260 \text{ roses/month}
\]

### Step 3: Find the difference between the total number of roses ordered and the total number of roses grown
\[
260 \text{ roses/month} - 160 \text{ roses/month} = 100 \text{ roses/month}
\]

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

"To find out how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade, we need to calculate the earnings for each period and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the earnings for the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- The total number of cups sold in four hours is \( 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups} \).
- The total earnings for the first four hours is \( 60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30 \).

Next, let's calculate the earnings for the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- The total number of cups sold in two hours is \( 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups} \).
- The total earnings for the next two hours is \( 20 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12 \).

Now, we add the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings = \$30 + \$12 = \$42.

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of \$42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many rotations the tires will undergo over a certain period and then find out how long it will take for the tires to reach their maximum rotation capacity.

1. **Determine the number of rotations per mile:**
   - Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Therefore, for 1 mile, the tires rotate \( \frac{725}{2} = 362.5 \) times.

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - So, the number of rotations per month is \( 400 \times 362.5 = 145,000 \) rotations.

3. **Determine the total number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - So, the number of rotations per year is \( 145,000 \times 12 = 1,740,000 \) rotations.

4. **Calculate the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.
   - The number of years before the tire needs to be replaced is \( \frac{10,440,000}{1,740,000} \approx 6 \) years.

6

So, the tire needs to be replaced after 6 years."
"To find out how much each pump of shampoo costs, we first need to determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from the bottle if she uses 1 pump per wash. 

The bottle gives 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash, so with 1 pump per wash, Jackie will get:
\[ 120 \times 2 = 240 \text{ washes} \]

Next, we need to find the cost per pump. The total cost of the bottle is $24.00, which is 2400 cents (since 1 dollar = 100 cents).

The cost per pump is:
\[ \frac{2400 \text{ cents}}{240 \text{ washes}} = 10 \text{ cents per pump} \]

"First, let's calculate how many pieces of gum Jim chews during the school day. Since he chews 1 piece of gum every 2 hours and the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:

8 hours / 2 hours per piece = 4 pieces of gum

Additionally, he chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so:

4 pieces (at school) + 1 piece (on the way home) + 1 piece (after dinner) = 6 pieces of gum

Starting with a 20-pack of gum, after chewing 6 pieces, he has:

20 pieces - 6 pieces = 14 pieces of gum

Jim then gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. So, he gives away:

14 pieces / 2 = 7 pieces

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.

1. **Total Cost of Classes**: $60
2. **Total Number of Classes**: 10
3. **Cost Per Class if All Attended**: $60 / 10 = $6

If Manny misses some classes, the cost per class he attends will increase. We need to find the maximum number of classes he can miss before the cost per class he attends exceeds $10.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny misses as \( x \).

- **Number of Classes Attended**: \( 10 - x \)
- **Cost Per Class Attended**: \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \)

We need to find the maximum \( x \) such that the cost per class attended is still $10 or less:

\[
\frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
60 \leq 10(10 - x)
\]

\[
60 \leq 100 - 10x
\]

\[
10x \leq 40
\]

\[
x \leq 4
\]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class he attends exceeds $10.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Each animal has one head.
2. Sheep have 4 legs.
3. Geese have 2 legs.

Let's define:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads (animals) is 20:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]
2. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
2S + G = 35
\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
\]
\[
2S + G - S - G = 15
\]
\[
S = 15

"To find out how much change Adam got, we need to calculate the total cost of the candies he bought and then subtract this from the $15 he paid.

First, calculate the cost of the candies of type A:
7 candies * $0.5 per candy = $3.5

Next, calculate the cost of the candies of type B:
10 candies * $0.75 per candy = $7.5

Now, add the costs of both types of candies to find the total cost:
$3.5 + $7.5 = $11

Finally, subtract the total cost from the amount Adam paid to find the change:
$15 - $11 = $4

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Days in the Month**: 30 days.
2. **Good Days in the First 30 Days**: 12 days.
3. **Bad Days in the First 30 Days**: 8 days.
4. **Neutral Days in the First 30 Days**: The rest of the days, which is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

Next, we need to consider the next three days:
- The next three days are good, neutral, and good.

So, we add these to the counts:
- **Good Days**: 12 (initial) + 2 (next three days) = 14 days.
- **Neutral Days**: 10 (initial) + 1 (next three days) = 11 days.
- **Bad Days**: 8 (initial) + 0 (next three days) = 8 days.

Now, we need to determine how many good days are left in the month. Since the month has 30 days and we have already accounted for 33 days (30 initial + 3 next days), we need to consider only the first 30 days for the final count.

Thus, the number of good days in the first 30 days is 12.

However, since the question asks for the number of good days left in the month after the next three days, we need to consider the total good days after the next three days, which is 14.

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:
14

"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ J = 2S + 3 \]

We are given that Janey has 21 books, so:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find \( S \), we need to solve the equation:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

First, subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we multiply 20 feet by 12 inches per foot:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

The bamboo grows 30 inches a day, and we want to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. 

The total growth needed is:

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Now, we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. James buys 8 toys to have enough for the 12 dogs, so he now has 4 (initial) + 8 (new) = 12 toys.
4. When James returns, there are twice as many dogs as when he left, so there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
5. James needs to buy more toys for the additional 12 dogs (24 - 12 = 12), so he buys 12 more toys, making the total 12 (current) + 12 (new) = 24 toys.
6. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs toys for those 3 dogs. The number of dogs is now 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.
7. James needs to have 21 toys for the 21 dogs, but he already has 24 toys, so he doesn't need to buy any more.

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 21.

"Let's start by defining the number of cookies each person has in terms of the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has. Let's call the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has \( C \).

1. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so Max has \( C + 12 \) cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Katarina has \( (C + 12) - 5 = C + 7 \) cookies.
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \( (C + 12) + 23 = C + 35 \) cookies.

We know that Katarina has 68 cookies, so we can set up the equation:
\[ C + 7 = 68 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = 68 - 7 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

Now we can find the number of cookies each person has:
- The Cookie Monster has \( C = 61 \) cookies.
- Max has \( C + 12 = 61 + 12 = 73 \) cookies.
- Katarina has 68 cookies (as given).
- Summer has \( C + 35 = 61 + 35 = 96 \) cookies.

To find the total number of cookies, we add the cookies of all four:
\[ 61 + 73 + 68 + 96 = 298 \]

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( L \).

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the new length of the dress before adding the lace trim is \( L + 0.5L = 1.5L \).

She then adds 20cm of lace trim to the bottom, making the final length of the dress \( 1.5L + 20 \) cm.

We know the final length of the dress is 140cm, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( L \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ L = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Chris took to mow half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

1. **Time to mow the entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode**: 1 hour (60 minutes).
2. **Time to mow the entire lawn in ""rabbit"" mode**: 40 minutes.

Since he mowed half of the lawn in each mode, we need to find the time for half the lawn in each mode.

- **Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode**:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- **Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode**:
  \[
  \frac{40 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 20 \text{ minutes}

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet: \( T = R + 7 \)
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44: \( 2T + 3R = 44 \)

First, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"First, let's find out the cost of the candies. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so the total cost for the lollipops is:

5 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the four candies:

$3.20 total cost - $2.00 cost of lollipops = $1.20 cost of four candies

To find the cost of one candy, we divide the total cost of the candies by the number of candies:

$1.20 cost of four candies / 4 candies = $0.30 per candy

Now we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:

10 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $4.00
10 candies * $0.30 per candy = $3.00

Adding these two amounts gives us the total cost:

$4.00 cost of lollipops + $3.00 cost of candies = $7.00

Therefore, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost Manolo $7.00.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20:
2 vaccines * $20/vaccine = $40

Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so:
Heartworm check = 0.60 * T

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
T = $40 + 0.60 * T

To find \( T \), we need to solve for \( T \) in the equation:
T - 0.60 * T = $40
0.40 * T = $40
T = $40 / 0.40
T = $100

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
$125 - $100 = $25

   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Cost of apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

   - The problem states there are 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The problem states there are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 (red squares) + 4 = 18 blue squares.

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The problem states there are 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 (blue squares) + 6 = 24 green squares.

4. **White Squares:**
   - The problem states there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 (green squares) - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares.

"First, we need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia each received from the $100 based on the ratio 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Each part is worth \( \frac{100}{5} = 20 \) dollars.

Gerald's share is 3 parts, so he received \( 3 \times 20 = 60 \) dollars.

Julia's share is 2 parts, so she received \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) dollars.

Next, we need to find out how much money Gerald has left after spending $10 on a book.

Gerald's remaining money is \( 60 - 10 = 50 \) dollars.

"To find out how many feet Martha's turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to determine the speed of the turtle.

1. We know the cat's speed is 15 feet/second.
2. The cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, so the turtle's speed is \( \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \).

Next, we calculate how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds:

3. Distance = Speed × Time
4. Distance = 3 feet/second × 40 seconds = 120 feet

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream can be made in 48 hours.

First, let's calculate the production rate for each type of ice cream:

1. **Chocolate Ice Cream:**
   - The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
   - The production rate is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

2. **Vanilla Ice Cream:**
   - The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
   - The production rate is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost per scoop**: Each scoop costs $1.50.
2. **Deal**: Buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free.
3. **Total money Erin has**: $6.00.

First, let's determine how many sets of 2 scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00:
- Each set of 2 scoops costs \(2 \times 1.50 = 3.00\) dollars.
- With $6.00, Erin can buy \(6.00 \div 3.00 = 2\) sets of 2 scoops.

Since each set of 2 scoops comes with 1 free scoop, for 2 sets, she gets:
- \(2 \times 2 = 4\) scoops (paid for)
- \(2 \times 1 = 2\) scoops (free)

So, the total number of scoops Erin can get is:
- \(4 + 2 = 6\) scoops

"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we calculate:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \]

So, Beck has 77 apples initially.

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After giving away 10 apples, Boris has:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck, after receiving 10 apples, has:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris. We subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.90 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 27 small buttons = 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - She started with 30 small stickers and traded 27, so she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.50 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.

5. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - She has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

6. **Total Small Buttons:**
   - She has 3 small stickers left from the initial trade and 60 small buttons from trading the remaining large stickers.
   - Total small buttons = 3 + 60 = 63 small buttons.

7. **Total Large Buttons:**
   - She has 9 large buttons from trading small stickers and 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.
   - Total large buttons = 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons.

8. **Total Buttons:**
   - Total buttons = Total small buttons + Total large buttons
   - Total buttons = 63 + 29 = 92

Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is 92.

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

Finally, we find out how much time she spends playing soccer by subtracting the time spent on video games from the remaining time:

- Remaining time after video games: 9 - 3 = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent on soccer}}{\text{Total time available}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{6}{12} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the Llesis family traveled, which includes both the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

1. **Calculate the driving distance:**
   - They drove for a total of 6 hours, but since they hiked for 1.5 hours, they drove for \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
   - Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour.
   - The driving distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Driving distance} = \text{Driving speed} \times \text{Driving time} = 50 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4.5 \, \text{hours} = 225 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the hiking distance:**
   - Their hiking speed was 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) miles per hour.
   - Therefore, their hiking speed is \( 25 - 5 = 20 \) miles per hour.
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - The hiking distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Hiking distance} = \text{Hiking speed} \times \text{Hiking time} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - The total distance is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \text{Driving distance} + \text{Hiking distance} = 225 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 255 \, \text{miles}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, Bob had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.
2. He bought 17 more fish from the pet store.
3. After adding these 17 fish, he found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of white fish Bob bought.
- \( 17 - x \) as the number of orange fish Bob bought.

After buying the fish, the total number of white fish Bob has is:
\[ 4 + x \]

The total number of orange fish Bob has is:
\[ 3 + (17 - x) = 20 - x \]

According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
\[ 20 - x = 2(4 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 20 - x = 8 + 2x \]
\[ 20 - 8 = 2x + x \]
\[ 12 = 3x \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first 2 weeks. She plays for half an hour every day, so:

0.5 hours/day * 14 days = 7 hours

Next, let's calculate the total hours she plays in the following week. She plays for 2 hours every day, so:

2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours

Now, let's add the hours from both periods to find the total hours played:

7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. So, the number of hours she still needs to play is:

30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between these distances.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled by the first car:**
   - Speed of the first car: 60 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. **Calculate the distance traveled by the second car:**
   - Speed of the second car: 70 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles

3. **Find the difference in the distances traveled:**
   - Distance traveled by the second car: 140 miles
   - Distance traveled by the first car: 120 miles
   - Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

Therefore, after 2 hours, the two cars will be 20 miles apart.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many square inches of mosaic Milo can make with the glass chips he has, and then use that to find out how long the mosaic can be if it is 3 inches tall.

1. First, calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has:
   \[
   2 \text{ bags} \times 72 \text{ chips per bag} = 144 \text{ chips}
   \]

2. Next, determine how many square inches of mosaic these chips can cover:
   \[
   \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips per square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches}
   \]

3. Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we need to find out how long it can be:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{height}
   \]
   \[
   12 \text{ square inches} = \text{length} \times 3 \text{ inches}
   \]
   \[
   \text{length} = \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches}
   \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches climbed in the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 per branch and he made $105 in a week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total money made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches} = 420 \]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = 60 \]

So, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is 60.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of petals Rose picked initially and then subtract the petals from the flowers she dropped.

1. **First set of flowers:**
   - 3 flowers with 5 petals each.
   - Total petals: \(3 \times 5 = 15\)

2. **Second set of flowers:**
   - 4 flowers with 6 petals each.
   - Total petals: \(4 \times 6 = 24\)

3. **Third set of flowers:**
   - 5 flowers with 4 petals each.
   - Total petals: \(5 \times 4 = 20\)

4. **Fourth set of flowers:**
   - 6 flowers with 7 petals each.
   - Total petals: \(6 \times 7 = 42\)

Now, we add up all the petals from the flowers she picked:
\[ 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \]

Next, we account for the flowers she dropped. She dropped 1 flower from each set:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

Total petals from the dropped flowers:
\[ 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \]

Subtract the petals from the dropped flowers from the total petals:
\[ 101 - 22 = 79 \]

So, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:

"First, let's figure out how many marshmallows were used and lost:

- John makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
- DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
- They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

Total marshmallows used and lost:
9 (John) + 9 (DeSean) + 3 (dropped) = 21 marshmallows

Now, let's find out how many marshmallows are left in the bag:
35 (total marshmallows) - 21 (used and lost) = 14 marshmallows

Since there are 14 marshmallows left and 2 kids, we divide the remaining marshmallows equally:
14 marshmallows ÷ 2 kids = 7 marshmallows per kid

So, each kid can have 7 more S'mores.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money spent by Jack and his three friends on playing the arcade games for 4 hours.

1. **Determine the play time for each person:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.
   - Two friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes with 1 quarter.
   - One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes with 1 quarter.

2. **Convert the total play time from hours to minutes:**
   - 4 hours = \(4 \times 60 = 240\) minutes.

3. **Calculate the number of quarters each person uses:**
   - Jack: \(240 \div 20 = 12\) quarters.
   - Two friends (each): \(240 \div 10 = 24\) quarters.
   - One friend: \(240 \div 30 = 8\) quarters.

4. **Calculate the total number of quarters used:**
   - Jack: 12 quarters.
   - Two friends: \(24 \times 2 = 48\) quarters.
   - One friend: 8 quarters.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so \( s = 2z \).

We know the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 2z + 2s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

Since \( s = 2z \), substitute \( 2z \) for \( s \):

\[ 2z + 4(2z) = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 8z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, substitute \( z = 1 \) back to find \( s \):

\[ s = 2z = 2(1) = 2 \]

The amount of oil is \( 2s \):

\[ 2s = 2(2) = 4 \]

So, the amount of oil Tanya uses is 4 ounces.

"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

1. **Cost of goats:**
   - John buys 3 goats.
   - Each goat costs $500.
   - Total cost for goats = 3 goats * $500/goat = $1500.

2. **Cost of cows:**
   - John buys 2 cows.
   - Each cow costs $1500.
   - Total cost for cows = 2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000.

3. **Total amount spent:**
   - Total cost for goats + Total cost for cows = $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

So, the total amount of money John spent is $4500.

"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we calculate 20% of 40:
\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving away cars. Initially, he had 40 cars. After selling 8 and giving away 16, the total number of cars he no longer has is:
\[ 8 + 16 = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Subtracting this from the initial number of cars Joe had:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, Joe remains with 16 cars.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

"To find out how many miles Mason has traveled in total, we need to calculate the distance he covered in each part of his journey and then add them together.

1. First, we calculate the distance Mason traveled in the first part of his journey:
   - Speed = 8 miles per hour
   - Time = 4 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles

2. Next, we calculate the distance Mason traveled in the second part of his journey:
   - Speed = 8 miles per hour
   - Time = 6 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles

3. Finally, we add the distances from both parts of the journey to find the total distance:
   - Total Distance = Distance in first part + Distance in second part = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then use that to find out how long it will take the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let's assume the distance across the highway is \( D \) miles.
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel this distance, the total time for one kangaroo to travel the same distance would be the same, as they are traveling at the same speed.
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is \( \frac{D}{18} \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.
   - Therefore, the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{D}{18} = \frac{D}{36} \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time it takes for one turtle to travel the distance:**
   - The time it takes for one turtle to travel \( D \) miles is \( \frac{D}{\frac{D}{36}} = 36 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance:**
   - Since the turtles are traveling at the same speed and the distance is the same, the number of turtles does not affect the time it takes for one turtle to travel the distance.
   - Therefore, it will take each of the four turtles 36 hours to travel the distance.

Thus, the time it will take four turtles to travel across the highway is 36 hours.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after all the contributions and then subtract the cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in reduces the price by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's add up the contributions and the amount she still needs to find out how much she has in her purse.

The total amount she has from her job and her mom is $150 + $80 = $230.
The total amount she needs to have to buy the laptop is $400 - $50 = $350.

"To find out how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces with 3 cows.
   - Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day.
   - So, 3 cows produce \(3 \times 5 = 15\) liters of milk a day.

2. Determine the additional amount of milk needed to reach 25 liters a day.
   - The farmer wants to produce 25 liters a day.
   - He currently produces 15 liters a day.
   - Therefore, he needs \(25 - 15 = 10\) more liters of milk a day.

3. Calculate how many more cows are needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk.
   - Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day.
   - To produce 10 more liters, he needs \(\frac{10}{5} = 2\) more cows.

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find out how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the original amount.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $300, the rate (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year, and the time (T) is 3 years.

First, calculate the interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3 \]

However, the rate should be in terms of a fraction or decimal of the principal, not the actual dollar amount. The correct rate is \( \frac{3}{4} \) or 0.75.

So, the correct calculation is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \]
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 675 \]

Now, add the simple interest to the original principal to find the total amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 675 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 975 \]

So, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \), the number of books that Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books that Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Together, they have 85 books: \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne: \( S = A + 25 \)
3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn: \( A = F - 12 \)

First, substitute \( A = F - 12 \) into the equation \( S = A + 25 \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now, substitute \( S = F + 13 \) and \( A = F - 12 \) into the total books equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Melanie's current age:**
   - We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old.
   - Therefore, her current age is \( 18 - 10 = 8 \) years old.

2. **Set up the equation for when her age will be three times her current age:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be three times her current age.
   - In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be \( 8 + x \).
   - We need this age to be three times her current age, which is \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \).

3. **Form the equation and solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   8 + x = 24
   \]
   \[
   x = 24 - 8
   \]
   \[
   x = 16
   \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

1. **Identify the payments for mowing lawns:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn.
   - Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \).

2. **Calculate the payments for mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns:**
   - Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - Tasha mowed Alba's lawn 5 times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

3. **Determine the total payment for mowing lawns:**
   - Joe's payment: \( 6J \) dollars.
   - Kamala's payment: \( 6 \times 3J = 18J \) dollars.
   - Alba's payment: \( 6 \times 5J = 30J \) dollars.
   - Total payment for mowing lawns: \( 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
   - Let \( L \) be the amount she made from lemonade sales.
   - Therefore, \( L + 54J = 80 \).

5. **Determine the value of \( J \):**
   - Since Joe paid $6, and we need to find out how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, we need to find \( J \).
   - We know that \( 54J \) is the total amount earned from mowing lawns.
   - To find \( J \), we need to solve for \( J \) in the equation \( 54J \leq 80 \).

6. **Solve for \( J \):**
   - \( 54J \leq 80 \)
   - \( J \leq \frac{80}{54} \)
   - \( J \leq \frac{40}{27} \approx 1.48 \)
   - Since \( J \) must be a whole number, the maximum value for \( J \) is 1.

7. **Calculate the total payment for mowing lawns with \( J = 1 \):**
   - \( 54 \times 1 = 54 \) dollars.

8. **Calculate the amount made from lemonade sales:**
   - \( L = 80 - 54 = 26 \) dollars.

Therefore, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is \( 26 \).

   - Denise read 10 pages.
   - Daniel read 13 pages.

2. **Pages read today:**
   - Denise read 5 more pages than what Daniel read yesterday.
   - Daniel read 0 pages today.

3. **Calculate the number of pages Denise read today:**
   - Daniel read 13 pages yesterday.
   - Denise read 5 more than 13 pages today.
   - Therefore, Denise read \( 13 + 5 = 18 \) pages today.

4. **Total pages read by each:**
   - Denise: \( 10 \) (yesterday) + \( 18 \) (today) = \( 28 \) pages.
   - Daniel: \( 13 \) (yesterday) + \( 0 \) (today) = \( 13 \) pages.

5. **Difference in the number of pages read:**
   - Denise read \( 28 \) pages.
   - Daniel read \( 13 \) pages.
   - The difference is \( 28 - 13 = 15 \) pages.

Therefore, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total capacity of the pot in terms of bowls:**
   - The pot can hold enough soup to fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.

2. **Convert the pot's capacity to a common unit:**
   - Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls (because 4 adult bowls = 8 child bowls), we can say that the pot holds 8 child bowls.

3. **Calculate the total number of bowls needed for dinner:**
   - Calvin (1 adult) + his wife (1 adult) + 2 children = 2 adult bowls + 2 child bowls.
   - Convert the adult bowls to child bowls: 2 adult bowls = 4 child bowls.
   - Total bowls needed = 4 child bowls (for adults) + 2 child bowls (for children) = 6 child bowls.

4. **Determine the number of child bowls left after dinner:**
   - The pot initially has 8 child bowls.
   - After dinner, 6 child bowls are used.
   - Remaining child bowls = 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls.

5. **Calculate how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup:**
   - There are 2 children and 2 child bowls left.
   - Each child can have 1 bowl of soup for lunch.

So, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 1 time.

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we can calculate the material required for the small and large masks separately and then add them together.

First, for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 small mask, she needs \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards of material.
- To make 20 small masks, she needs \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards of material.

Next, for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 large mask, she needs \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards of material.
- To make 8 large masks, she needs \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards of material.

Adding the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

"Let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Duncan's age eight years ago was \( D - 8 \).
2. Adam's age four years ago was \( A - 4 \).
3. Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, so \( D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \).
4. Duncan's current age is 60, so \( D = 60 \).

Substitute \( D = 60 \) into the equation \( D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \):
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

"To find out how much allowance Julia and Nadine each received, we need to calculate the total amount they spent and then divide it by 2, since they both contributed equally.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons. 
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - 2 * $7 = $14

Now, add up all the costs:
- Total cost = $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they had the same amount of allowance:
- Total allowance for both = $28
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Balloons:**
   - Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons.
   - So, the total number of balloons given to her friends is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) balloons.
   - Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.

   Therefore, the total number of balloons at the start is:
   \[
   8 + 1 = 9 \text{ balloons}
   \]

2. **Additional Balloons from Maria's Mom:**
   - Maria's mom gave each person (Maria and her 4 friends) 3 more balloons.
   - There are 5 people in total (Maria + 4 friends).
   - So, the total number of additional balloons is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) balloons.

3. **Total Balloons:**
   - Adding the initial balloons to the additional balloons:
   \[
   9 + 15 = 24 \text{ balloons}
   \]

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is:
\[
24

"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated by the 10 people. Each person donates 5 boxes, so:
10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes

Next, we add the 10 boxes of stuff they already have:
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Now, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all 60 boxes, given that 2 boxes fit per table:
60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

They already own 15 tables, so the number of new tables needed is:
30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

"First, let's determine how much hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. 

Twice the amount each goat needs is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

So, each sheep needs:
\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats:
\[ 15 \text{ goats} \times 5 \text{ pounds/goat} = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep:
\[ 12 \text{ sheep} \times 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts of hay needed for the goats and the sheep:
\[ 75 \text{ pounds} + 84 \text{ pounds} = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:
- John earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
  \( 50 \times 6 = 300 \) dollars.

Next, we'll subtract his expenses:
- He spends 50 dollars on gas, so:
  \( 300 - 50 = 250 \) dollars remaining.
- He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so:
  \( 250 - 100 = 150 \) dollars remaining.
- He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so:
  \( 5 \times 10 = 50 \) dollars spent on pencils.
- Subtracting the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:
  \( 150 - 50 = 100 \) dollars remaining.

Now, we need to determine how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining 100 dollars:
- Each pen costs 25 dollars, so:
  \( 100 \div 25 = 4 \) pens.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount. Each CD costs $15, so:

10 CDs * $15/CD = $150

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost. A 40% discount means James pays 60% of the original price:

$150 * 0.60 = $90

This is the total amount James spends on the 10 CDs.

James then decides he doesn't like 5 of the CDs and sells them for $40. This means he recovers $40 from the CDs he no longer wants.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he recovered from the total amount he spent:

$90 - $40 = $50

So, the final amount of money James was out is:

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can write these as equations:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: \( X = S + 5 \).
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught: \( S = 4A - 13 \).

First, substitute \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ A + S + (S + 5) = 339 \]
\[ A + 2S + 5 = 339 \]
\[ A + 2S = 334 \]

   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles.

2. **Second leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles.

3. **Third leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles.

Now, we sum the distances traveled south and subtract the distance traveled north:

- Total distance south = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles.
- Total distance north = 36 miles.

The net distance traveled south is:
- Net distance = Total distance south - Total distance north = 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles.

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

"To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of brownies Greta had initially.
2. Subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party.

First, let's convert all the quantities to individual brownies (1 dozen = 12 brownies):

- Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies: \(1 \times 12 = 12\) brownies.
- She brought home 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office: \(0.5 \times 12 = 6\) brownies.
- Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies to the surprise party: \(4 \times 12 = 48\) brownies.

Now, add these amounts to find the total number of brownies Greta had initially:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \]

Next, calculate the number of brownies eaten during the party:
- 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten: \(1.5 \times 12 = 18\) brownies.

Subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \]

So, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many flowers Pat can fit in her flower bed, how many more she needs to buy, and then calculate the total cost.

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower is 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot.

2. **Determine the total space each plant (including the space between them) will occupy:**
   - Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - Therefore, each plant and the space between it and the next plant will occupy 1 foot (for the plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Calculate how many plants can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - Number of plants that can fit = 111 feet / 2.5 feet per plant = 44.4 plants.
   - Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

4. **Determine how many more plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.
   - Number of additional plants needed = 44 - 17 = 27 plants.

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: peeling the shrimp and sautéing them.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To find out how long it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the rate at which she peels them:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To find out how long it takes to sauté 90 shrimp, we first determine how many batches of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 10 minutes to sauté, the total time to sauté 90 shrimp is:
     \[
     \text{Time to sauté 90 shrimp} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - To find the total time to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp, we add the time for peeling and the time for sautéing:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Three times the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - \(90 - 75 = 15\)

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of trips the first plane makes:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips.

2. **Calculate the number of trips to Greece:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - So, the number of trips to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \) trips.

3. **Calculate the number of trips to France and Germany:**
   - The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany.
   - The remaining flights are \( 88 - 66 = 22 \) trips.
   - Since these 22 trips are split equally between France and Germany, the number of trips to France is \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \) trips.

Thus, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

"To find the combined length of time the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum them up.

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - Combined howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the combined howl duration to minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

- Wilfred: \( W \) years

The total age of the children is given by:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we use the information that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, Wilfred is 3 years old.

"First, let's find out the total number of cookies brought by the guests to the wedding reception. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies.

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give 1/2 of these cookies to the church next door.

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 \text{ cookies} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find out how many people were in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received.

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define the size of each slice:**
   - Let the size of each kid's slice be \( x \).
   - Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, the size of each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

2. **Calculate the total number of slices:**
   - There are 4 kids, so the total size of the kids' slices is \( 4x \).
   - There are 2 adults, so the total size of the adults' slices is \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \).

3. **Calculate the total size of the watermelon:**
   - The total size of the watermelon is the sum of the sizes of all the slices: \( 4x + 4x = 8x \).

4. **Determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets:**
   - Each adult gets a slice of size \( 2x \).
   - The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is calculated by dividing the size of one adult's slice by the total size of the watermelon and then multiplying by 100:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
     \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( x \) be the number of chocolate bars in one box.

Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combine the terms on the left side:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost and then determine the earnings. However, the problem does not specify the charge per student or the total number of weeks in the month, so I'll assume the studio charges a fee per student to cover the costs and make a profit, and we'll calculate based on a typical 4-week month.

1. **Calculate the weekly cost:**
   - **Studio rental cost per session:** $25
   - **Cost per student per session:** $1.50
   - **Number of students:** 10
   - **Number of sessions per week:** 3

   **Total cost for studio rental per week:**
   \[
   25 \times 3 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   **Total cost for students per session:**
   \[
   1.50 \times 10 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   **Total cost for students per week:**
   \[
   15 \times 3 = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   **Total weekly cost:**
   \[
   75 + 45 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the monthly cost:**
   - **Number of weeks in a month:** 4

   **Total monthly cost:**
   \[
   120 \times 4 = 480 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Since the problem does not specify the revenue (i.e., how much the studio charges the students), we can only calculate the total monthly cost. If the studio is to break even, it must earn at least $480 per month.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

"To find out the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

1. **Calculate the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge before the last 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( x - 0.07 \times 3x = x - 0.21x = 0.79x \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( 0.79x = 28 \).
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{28}{0.79} \approx 35.44\%
     \]

2. **Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge before the first 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( y - 0.09 \times 5y = y - 0.45y = 0.55y \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge is 35.44%.
   - Therefore, \( 0.55y = 35.44 \).
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{35.44}{0.55} \approx 64.44\%

"The Smith twins found a total of 30 eggs each, so together they found:
30 eggs + 30 eggs = 60 eggs

There were 100 eggs in total, and 10 eggs were not found, so the number of eggs that were found is:
100 eggs - 10 eggs = 90 eggs

The number of eggs found by the friends is the total number of eggs found minus the eggs found by the Smith twins:
90 eggs - 60 eggs = 30 eggs

The friends found 30 eggs.

"First, let's determine how much ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in one day.

1. A dwarf mines 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so:
   \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pounds per day.
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so:
   \( 24 + (0.5 \times 24) = 24 + 12 = 36 \) pounds per day.

Now, let's calculate how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in one day with steel pickaxes:
\( 40 \times 36 = 1440 \) pounds per day.

Finally, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days:
\( 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \) pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches based on the given information that the prices are proportional.

First, let's look at the cost per sandwich for the first two packages:
- The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the cost per sandwich is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) dollars.
- The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the cost per sandwich is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) dollars.

Since the cost per sandwich is the same for both packages, we can use this cost to find the price of the third package, which contains 8 sandwiches.

The cost for 8 sandwiches would be:
\[ 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \]

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the wind. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst:
\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]
So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving her with:
\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]
red balloons.

Next, let's determine how many yellow balloons Sally released. She initially had 12 yellow balloons, and she released half of them:
\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \]
So, 6 yellow balloons were released, leaving her with:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]
yellow balloons.

Now, let's consider the blue balloons. Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her clutch:
\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]
So, she added 6 blue balloons to her remaining balloons.

Finally, let's add up all the balloons Sally carried into the school:
- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7
- Yellow balloons: 6
- Blue balloons: 6

Total number of balloons:

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider all the scenarios where he does not have to turn it in and then subtract this from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - There's a 50% chance that there will be a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework.
   - If this happens, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - There's a 50% chance that the normal teacher will be there.
   - If the normal teacher is there, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension.
   - If the normal teacher is there and doesn't give an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.

Let's calculate the probability for each scenario where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:

- **Substitute Teacher (50%):** 
  - Probability = 50% or 0.50

- **Normal Teacher (50%) and Extension (40%):**
  - Probability = 50% * 40% = 0.50 * 0.40 = 0.20 or 20%

- **Normal Teacher (50%) and No Extension (60%) and Personal Extension (20%):**
  - Probability = 50% * 60% * 20% = 0.50 * 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.06 or 6%

Now, add up all the probabilities where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
- Total probability = 50% + 20% + 6% = 76%

Finally, subtract this from 100% to find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:
- Probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework = 100% - 76% = 24%

"To find out how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats available for friends and family by subtracting the seats for graduates and faculty from the total seats.
2. Divide the number of seats available for friends and family by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can give.

First, let's calculate the total number of seats available for friends and family:
Total seats = 6000
Seats for graduates = 950
Seats for faculty = 300

Seats available for friends and family = Total seats - Seats for graduates - Seats for faculty
Seats available for friends and family = 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750

Next, we divide the seats available for friends and family by the number of graduates:
Number of graduates = 950

Tickets per graduate = Seats available for friends and family / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950 = 5

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Jim's college education and the income he lost by not working during those 4 years. Then, we'll determine how long it will take him to earn back this total amount with his new, higher salary.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the loans:**
   - Jim takes $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   - Total loans = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000

2. **Calculate the income lost during college:**
   - Jim could have earned $25,000 per year if he had not gone to college.
   - Income lost = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000

3. **Calculate the total amount Jim needs to earn back:**
   - Total amount = Total loans + Income lost
   - Total amount = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

4. **Calculate Jim's new income after college:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - New income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

5. **Calculate the net additional income per year after college:**
   - Net additional income = New income - Previous income
   - Net additional income = $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000 per year

6. **Determine how long it will take to earn back the total amount:**
   - Time to earn back = Total amount / Net additional income
   - Time to earn back = $300,000 / $50,000 = 6 years

Therefore, it will take Jim 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To find out how much fabric Jim needs, we first need to determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces he will use. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Jim needs pieces that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

First, we calculate the new dimensions:
- Length of the fabric piece: 6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet
- Width of the fabric piece: 8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
- Area of one piece = Length × Width = 8 feet × 10 feet = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
- Total area needed = 80 square feet × 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday**: They delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday.
   - One-fifth of Monday's letters: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - Adding 17 to this: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)
   - So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

3. **Wednesday**: They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice Tuesday's letters: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - Adding 5 to this: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)
   - So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, we sum the letters delivered over the three days:

- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the equation:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

1. **Initial Price in 2007**: $20,000
2. **Depreciation Rate**: 21% per year, which means the car retains 79% of its value each year (100% - 21% = 79%).

The formula to calculate the value of the car after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, \( n = 3 \) years (from 2007 to 2010).

\[ \text{Value} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

First, calculate \( 0.79^3 \):
\[ 0.79^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 \approx 0.493 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:
\[ \text{Value} = 20000 \times 0.493 \approx 9860 \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9860.

"To find out how many stickers Leo has in his collection now, we need to add up the stickers he had and collected over the past years.

1. Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
2. Last year, he collected 50 more stickers, so the total at the end of last year was:
   \[100 + 50 = 150\]
3. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as last year, which means:
   \[2 \times 50 = 100\]
4. Adding this year's collection to last year's total:
   \[150 + 100 = 250\]

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection now.

"To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of food the cats eat in one day.
2. Divide the total amount of food Imma has by the amount the cats eat in one day.

First, we know that Imma feeds her cats 60 grams of food per meal, and she feeds them twice a day. So, the total amount of food per day for one cat is:
\[ 60 \text{ grams/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 120 \text{ grams/day} \]

Since Imma has 3 cats, the total amount of food all the cats eat in one day is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams/day} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we have 720 grams of cat food. To find out how many days this will last, we divide the total amount of food by the amount the cats eat in one day:
\[ 720 \text{ grams} \div 360 \text{ grams/day} = 2 \text{ days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many slices Jake ate:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake.
   - Therefore, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.

2. **Determine how many slices Silvia ate:**
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake.
   - Therefore, Silvia ate \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.

3. **Calculate the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Jake ate 7 slices.
   - Silvia ate 14 slices.
   - Total slices eaten = \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\).

4. **Verify the total number of slices available:**
   - Each pizza has 8 slices.
   - There are 4 pizzas.
   - Total slices available = \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

Since the total slices eaten (31) is less than the total slices available (32), the calculation is correct.

The final numerical answer is:
31"
"Let's denote the time Donovan took to make his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the times taken by Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:
\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan took 40 minutes to make his part. Betsy's part, which took 18 minutes longer, is:
\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

1. **Cost of the cast**: $200
2. **Cost of the visit**: The visit lasts 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The doctor charges $300 per hour, so for 0.5 hours, the cost is:
   \[
   0.5 \text{ hours} \times 300 \text{ dollars/hour} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the painkillers**: Hannah gets 30 painkillers, and each pill costs $4, so the total cost is:
   \[
   30 \text{ pills} \times 4 \text{ dollars/pill} = 120 \text{ dollars}

So, the glee club has:
20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left

Next, let's calculate for the football team:

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so:
2 * 20 = 40 pizzas

The football team ate 80% of them:
80% of 40 = 0.80 * 40 = 32 pizzas

So, the football team has:
40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of mailing both the small and big coupons.

1. **Calculate the number of big coupons:**
   Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he is sending out 700 small coupons:
   \[
   \text{Number of big coupons} = 2 \times 700 = 1400
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons:**
   Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the small coupons is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of small coupons} = 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons:**
   Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the big coupons is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of big coupons} = 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of mailing all the coupons:**

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of purchasing 6 pounds of butter under the promotion ""buy one pound of butter get one half off.""

1. **Determine the number of pounds of butter needed:**
   - Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
   - He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   - Therefore, he needs \( 6 \) pounds of butter.

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   - For every pound of butter purchased at full price, the next pound is half off.
   - This means for every 2 pounds of butter, the cost is \( 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   - Since the promotion applies to every 2 pounds, we can divide the total pounds needed by 2 to find the number of full-price and half-price pairs.
   - \( 6 \) pounds / \( 2 \) pounds per pair = \( 3 \) pairs.
   - Each pair costs \( 6.00 \) dollars.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bananas eaten by all monkeys in a week.
2. Determine the daily consumption of the first and second monkeys.
3. Subtract the daily consumption of the first and second monkeys from the total daily consumption to find the daily consumption of the third monkey.

First, we know that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by all monkeys in a week is 315.

Next, we calculate the daily consumption of the first and second monkeys:
- The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
- The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Now, we find the total daily consumption of the first and second monkeys:
- The first monkey eats 10 bananas/day.
- The second monkey eats 14 bananas/day.
- Together, they eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas/day.

Since the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315, the total daily consumption for all three monkeys is:
- 315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas/day.

Finally, we subtract the daily consumption of the first and second monkeys from the total daily consumption to find the daily consumption of the third monkey:
- 45 bananas/day (total) - 24 bananas/day (first and second monkeys) = 21 bananas/day.

Therefore, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

The cost of 3 roses at $2 each is 3 * $2 = $6.

So, the total cost for 15 roses is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with five 5 dollar bills, which totals 5 * $5 = $25.

The amount of money Jenny has left after buying the roses is $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 into quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so the number of quarters she gets is $4 / $0.25 = 16 quarters.

"First, let's calculate the total number of periods John has in a week. He has 6 periods a day for 5 days, plus 2 extra classes each day for 5 days:
\[ 6 \times 5 + 2 \times 5 = 30 + 10 = 40 \text{ periods} \]

Each period is 40 minutes long, so the total minutes spent in class during the week is:
\[ 40 \text{ periods} \times 40 \text{ minutes/period} = 1600 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time each day:
\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he does this on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time over the weekend is:
\[ 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the extra learning time to the total class time to get the total weekly learning time:
\[ 1600 \text{ minutes} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the total minutes to hours:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial height from which the ball is dropped.
2. Determine the height of the first bounce.
3. Determine the height of the second bounce.

**Step 1: Calculate the initial height.**
The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high. Therefore, the initial height is:
\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

**Step 2: Determine the height of the first bounce.**
The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height. So, the height of the first bounce is:
\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

**Step 3: Determine the height of the second bounce.**
The ball again bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height of the first bounce. So, the height of the second bounce is:
\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height of the ball on its second bounce is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat.
2. Before the Allosaurus ate, the velociraptors had scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. This means the 270 kilograms is half of what was left after the velociraptors scavenged.
3. Therefore, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate but before the velociraptors scavenged was \( 270 \times 2 = 540 \) kilograms.
4. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the 540 kilograms is half of the original amount of meat on the triceratops.
5. Therefore, the original amount of meat on the triceratops was \( 540 \times 2 = 1080 \) kilograms.

"To find out how much it will cost to paint the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are needed and the total cost.

1. Calculate the area of the north and south walls:
   - Each wall is 10 x 8 feet, so the area of one wall is \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet.
   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(80 \times 2 = 160\) square feet.

2. Calculate the area of the east and west walls:
   - Each wall is 5 x 8 feet, so the area of one wall is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet.
   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) square feet.

3. Calculate the total area of all four walls:
   - Total area = area of north and south walls + area of east and west walls
   - Total area = \(160 + 80 = 240\) square feet.

4. Determine how many gallons of paint are needed:
   - A gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.
   - Number of gallons needed = total area / coverage per gallon
   - Number of gallons needed = \(240 / 20 = 12\) gallons.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers:**
   - 2 workers produce 6 toys per hour each.
   - 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour each.
   - Each worker works for 10 hours.

   So, the total production by the first 2 workers:
   \[
   2 \text{ workers} \times 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ toys}
   \]

   And the total production by the next 2 workers:
   \[
   2 \text{ workers} \times 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 80 \text{ toys}
   \]

   Adding these together gives the total production by the first 4 workers:
   \[
   120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers:**
   - The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to complete the order of 400 toys.
   - Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is:
   \[
   400 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 380 \text{ toys}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of toys produced by the fifth worker:**
   - The first 4 workers produced 200 toys.
   - The total production by all 5 workers is 380 toys.
   - Therefore, the fifth worker produced:
   \[
   380 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 180 \text{ toys}
   \]

4. **Determine the production rate of the fifth worker:**
   - The fifth worker worked for 10 hours.
   - The number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
   \[
   \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour}
   \]

So, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs, we first need to calculate the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory’s dog.

Kory’s dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah’s first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah’s second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weights of all three dogs:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let \( S \) be the number of stickers Seth had initially.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris. The remaining stickers are \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \).
5. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, Kris had \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers.
6. Since Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we have \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).

Now, solve for \( S \):
\[ \frac{S}{4} = 16 \]
\[ S = 16 \times 4 \]
\[ S = 64 \]

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

"First, we need to find out how many M&M's John has in total from the 3 large bags. Each large bag weighs 10 ounces, and there are 30 M&M's per ounce.

Total M&M's from one large bag = 10 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 300 M&M's

Since John has 3 large bags:
Total M&M's from 3 large bags = 3 * 300 M&M's = 900 M&M's

Now, if John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, we can find out how many small bags he can make by dividing the total number of M&M's by 10.

Number of small bags = 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag = 90 bags

"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the distance that is half of the way around the earth.
2. Calculate how many days it will take Alfie to fly that distance.

First, the circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of the way around the earth is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Next, Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Liam is currently 16 years old.
2. Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.
3. According to the problem, two years ago, Liam’s age was twice the age of Vince. So, if we let Vince's age two years ago be \( V \), then:
   \[
   14 = 2V
   \]
4. Solving for \( V \):
   \[
   V = \frac{14}{2} = 7
   \]
5. This means Vince was 7 years old two years ago.
6. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:
   \[
   7 + 2 = 9

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total eggs painted by all four**: 56 eggs.
2. **Eggs painted by Camden and Sarah**: 30 eggs.
3. **Eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline**: 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.
4. **Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs**: So, each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now, let's find out how many eggs Camden and Sarah each painted:
5. **Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah**. Let's say Sarah painted \( S \) eggs. Then Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.
6. **Total eggs painted by Camden and Sarah**: \( S + (S + 12) = 30 \).
7. Simplify the equation: \( 2S + 12 = 30 \).
8. Subtract 12 from both sides: \( 2S = 18 \).
9. Divide by 2: \( S = 9 \).

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

Finally, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
10. **Camden painted 21 eggs**.
11. **Arnold painted 13 eggs**.
12. **Difference**: 21 - 13 = 8.

2. Calculate the number of boxes needed.
3. Calculate the total weight of the crayons.
4. Calculate the total weight of the boxes.
5. Add the total weight of the crayons and the boxes.
6. Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds.

Step 1: Determine the number of groups of 8 crayons.
\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of boxes needed.
Since each group of 8 crayons goes into one box, the number of boxes is the same as the number of groups.
\[ \text{Number of boxes} = 25 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the crayons.
\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Step 4: Calculate the total weight of the boxes.
\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

1. **Determine Grandma's speed on the beach:**
   - Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes.
   - Speed on the beach = Distance / Time = 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

2. **Determine Grandma's speed on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk.
   - Speed on the sidewalk = 2 * 0.05 miles per minute = 0.1 miles per minute.

3. **Calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk:**
   - Distance on the sidewalk = 1 mile.
   - Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

4. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   - Time on the beach = 40 minutes.
   - Time on the sidewalk = 10 minutes.

"First, let's figure out how many marbles Bob has initially. 

We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. So, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.

Let's set up the equation to find out how many marbles Bob has initially:
\[ \text{Initial marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtract 24 from both sides to solve for the initial number of marbles:
\[ \text{Initial marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Initial marbles} = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we need to subtract 10 from his initial number of marbles:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug.
- The temperature of the water in the first mug is 33 degrees.
- Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of \( T_2 \)-degree water.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) of the mixed water is given by the weighted average of the temperatures of the two waters:

\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{4 + 1} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:

\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{5} \geq 40 \]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):

\[ 4 \times 33 = 132 \]

Now, substitute this into the inequality:

\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T_2 \):

\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is 68 degrees.

"To find the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to calculate the individual probabilities of each ticket winning and then multiply these probabilities together.

1. The probability that the first lottery ticket wins is given as 20%, or 0.20.
2. The second lottery ticket is three times more likely to win than the first. Therefore, the probability that the second ticket wins is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\).

Now, we multiply the probabilities of both tickets winning:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

2. Find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
3. Calculate the total number of collections he makes in a week.
4. Determine his weekly earnings based on the number of collections and the rate he gets paid.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.**

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes:
\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \text{ apartments} \]
\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

**Step 2: Find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.**

"To find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree**: 50 fruits
2. **6-year-old tree**: 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. **7-year-old tree**: 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. **8-year-old tree**: 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We need to find the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree first.
5. **9-year-old tree**: 0 fruits (as given)
6. **10-year-old tree**: 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, we can find the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree:
- 8-year-old tree: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits

Next, we sum up the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits produced from age 5 to age 10:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350 fruits

Since the question asks for the total fruits produced during its 10 years of life, we need to consider the first 4 years as well. However, the problem does not provide information about the number of fruits produced in the first 4 years, so we assume they produce 0 fruits.

Thus, the total number of fruits produced during the 10 years is:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters. According to the problem, the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now, we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters. The length of the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Amount Given to Their Little Sister:**
   - Let the amount each gave to their little sister be \(x\).

3. **Rissa's Remaining Money:**
   - After giving \(x\) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money.
   - Therefore, \(15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\).

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   This can be written as:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   This can be written as:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5C + 35
\]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]

Distribute the 3 on the left side:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[
75 = 2C + 35
\]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[
40 = 2C
\]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20
\]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to determine the total number of books he can buy with $27000. 

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy:
   - If $500 buys 100 books, then $1 buys \( \frac{100}{500} = 0.2 \) books.
   - Therefore, $27000 buys \( 27000 \times 0.2 = 5400 \) books.

2. Since the books are distributed equally among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3:
   - \( \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \) books per school.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider both the rate at which Jay makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of making snowballs**: Jay can make 20 snowballs in one hour. This means he makes 5 snowballs every 15 minutes (since 20 snowballs / 4 intervals = 5 snowballs per 15 minutes).

2. **Rate of melting snowballs**: 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.

3. **Net rate of snowball accumulation**: Every 15 minutes, Jay makes 5 snowballs but loses 2 due to melting. Therefore, the net increase in snowballs every 15 minutes is 5 - 2 = 3 snowballs.

4. **Total snowballs needed**: Jay needs 60 snowballs.

5. **Time to accumulate 60 snowballs**: Since he gains 3 snowballs every 15 minutes, we can calculate the total time required by dividing the total number of snowballs needed by the net rate of accumulation:
   \[
   \text{Time (in 15-minute intervals)} = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{3 \text{ snowballs per 15 minutes}} = 20 \text{ intervals}
   \]
   Each interval is 15 minutes, so:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 20 \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 300 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the year Digimon came out:**
   - Digimon had its 20th anniversary, which means it came out 20 years ago.
   - If the current year is 2023, then Digimon came out in 2023 - 20 = 2003.

2. **Determine John's age when Digimon came out:**
   - John is 28 years old now (in 2023).
   - Therefore, in 2003, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out:**
   - When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - If John was 8 years old, then Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

4. **Determine Jim's current age:**
   - Since 20 years have passed since 2003, Jim is now 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

So, Jim is 24 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of bandages used each day:**
   - On the first day, they used 38 bandages.
   - On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - On the third day, they used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.

2. **Calculate the total number of bandages used over the three days:**
   - Total bandages used = \(38 + 28 + 25 = 91\)

3. **Determine the total number of bandages ordered:**
   - On the first day, they ordered 1 bulk pack, which is 50 bandages.
   - On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - Total bandages ordered = \(50 + 100 = 150\)

4. **Calculate the total number of bandages available at the end of the third day:**
   - Let \(x\) be the number of bandages they started with on the first day.
   - Total bandages available at the end of the third day = \(x + 150 - 91\)

5. **Set up the equation based on the information given:**
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.
   - Therefore, \(x + 150 - 91 = 78\)

6. **Solve for \(x\):**

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of blood in one shark.
2. Calculate the total amount of blood in ten sharks.

First, we know that each whale has 40 gallons of blood. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, we can calculate the amount of blood in one shark as follows:
\[ \text{Blood in one shark} = 3 \times 40 \text{ gallons} = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. We do this by multiplying the amount of blood in one shark by 10:
\[ \text{Blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 \text{ gallons} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have is:

"First, let's find the cost per bottle of scotch:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{\text{Total cost of scotch}}{\text{Number of bottles}} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of bottles of cognac John buys:
\[ \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times \text{Number of bottles of scotch} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Now, let's find the cost per bottle of cognac:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} + 50\% \times \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the cognac:
\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = \text{Number of bottles of cognac} \times \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we find the total amount John spends on everything:

   - Number of red hats = \( \frac{100}{2} = 50 \).

2. **Calculate the number of remaining hats after accounting for the red hats:**
   - Total hats = 100
   - Red hats = 50
   - Remaining hats = 100 - 50 = 50

3. **Calculate the number of blue hats:**
   - 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue.
   - Number of blue hats = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \).

4. **Calculate the number of white hats:**

"First, we need to find the cost of the bag after the discount. The original price is $18.00, and the discount is $3.00, so the discounted price is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find the cost per stick of jerky. There are 30 sticks in a bag, and the bag costs $15.00, so the cost per stick is:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents:

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

So, the cost per stick of jerky is 50 cents.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Phineas Frog to travel half the distance on land and half the distance in water.

1. **Total Distance**: 200 yards
2. **Distance on Land**: Half of 200 yards = 100 yards
3. **Distance in Water**: Half of 200 yards = 100 yards

Next, we calculate the time it takes to travel each part of the journey:

- **Time on Land**: 
  \[
  \text{Time on Land} = \frac{\text{Distance on Land}}{\text{Speed on Land}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- **Time in Water**: 
  \[
  \text{Time in Water} = \frac{\text{Distance in Water}}{\text{Speed in Water}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we add the time for both parts of the journey to get the total time:

\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time on Land} + \text{Time in Water} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}

   - Vanessa ran 4 miles, and she ran twice as far as Aaron.
   - Therefore, Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

2. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - So, Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

3. **Determine Vanessa's speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - Therefore, Vanessa's speed is \( 2 \times 8 \text{ minutes per mile} = 16 \text{ minutes per mile} \).

4. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Vanessa's speed is 16 minutes per mile.
   - For 4 miles, the time taken is \( 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

So, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much line the caretaker needs in total and then subtract the amount of line he already has.

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed:
   - The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.
   - There are 200 feet of dock.
   - Therefore, the total line needed is \( 3 \times 200 = 600 \) feet.

2. Subtract the amount of line he already has:
   - He already has 6 feet of new line.
   - Therefore, the amount of line he needs to buy is \( 600 - 6 = 594 \) feet.

"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes a week, we need to calculate the total income from reservations for the days they are open.

1. First, calculate the total cost of one reservation:
   - 2 meals at $5 each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars
   - 1 bottle of wine: \(5\) dollars
   - Total cost per reservation: \(10 + 5 = 15\) dollars

2. Next, calculate the total income from reservations per night:
   - 6 reservations per night: \(6 \times 15 = 90\) dollars

3. Finally, calculate the total income for the week:
   - Open 2 days a week: \(2 \times 90 = 180\) dollars

"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the watermelons.
2. Determine the total selling price with the profit.
3. Calculate the selling price per watermelon.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the watermelons.**
The total cost is given as $80.

**Step 2: Determine the total selling price with the profit.**
The profit is 25% of the total cost. First, calculate 25% of $80:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 80 = 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \]

So, the total profit is $20. Add this profit to the total cost to get the total selling price:
\[ 80 + 20 = 100 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the selling price per watermelon.**
The total selling price is $100, and there are 50 watermelons. Divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dora's current age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - Therefore, Dora is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **Determine James's current age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora.
   - Therefore, James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **Determine John's current age:**
   - John had James when he was 19.
   - Since James is 18 years old, John is currently \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - Since John is currently 37 years old, his youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years:**
   - In 3 years, John's youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in one hour and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour = 60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges.

2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour = 60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges.

3. **Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:**
   - Difference = Number of oranges Ana can peel - Number of oranges Jane can peel
   - Difference = 20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 oranges.

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original price is $400, and he gets it for 80% off.

The discount amount is:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, the price he pays for the radiator is:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost for the mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the installation:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the total amount Mark paid is:
230"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of chickens.
- \( k \) as the number of cows.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

Next, we can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we first need to calculate the total number of slices from the 7 pizzas. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people (Henry and his 3 friends, which makes 4 people in total):

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each person can have 14 slices.
