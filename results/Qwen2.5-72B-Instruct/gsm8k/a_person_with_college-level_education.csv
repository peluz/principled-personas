"To determine the total number of bolts needed for a robe, we need to calculate the amount of both blue and white fiber required.

1. The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The robe takes half as many bolts of white fiber as blue fiber. Therefore, the amount of white fiber needed is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt}
   \]

3. To find the total number of bolts, we add the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber:
   \[
   2 \text{ bolts (blue)} + 1 \text{ bolt (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts}
   \]

Thus, the total number of bolts needed for the robe is:

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the house including the purchase price and the repairs.
2. Determine the new value of the house after the repairs.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the house.**

The purchase price of the house is $80,000, and the cost of repairs is $50,000.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000
\]

**Step 2: Determine the new value of the house after the repairs.**

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. To find the new value, we first calculate 150% of the original value of the house.

\[
150\% \text{ of } 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000
\]

The new value of the house is the original value plus the increase in value.

\[
\text{New value} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**

The profit is the new value of the house minus the total cost.

\[
\text{Profit} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000
\]

Thus, Josh's profit is:

\[
70,000

"To find out how many total meters James runs a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he does each session by the distance of each sprint, and then multiply that by the number of times he runs per week.

James runs 3 sprints each session, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, for each session, he runs:
3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

He runs 3 times a week, so the total distance he runs each week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed required for the entire day for all the chickens.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily requirement.

First, calculate the total daily feed requirement for 20 chickens:
- Each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day.
- For 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
  \[
  3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups}
  \]

Next, calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups of feed.
- The total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
  \[
  15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
  \]

Finally, determine the amount of feed needed for the final meal:
- Subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily requirement:
  \[
  60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups}
  \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To determine the total cost for 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first glass and every second glass:
- The cost of the first glass is $5.
- The cost of the second glass is $3.

Since this pattern repeats, we can group the glasses into pairs:
- Each pair of glasses costs $5 (first glass) + $3 (second glass) = $8.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, which is 8 pairs of glasses:
- The total cost for 8 pairs is 8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

"Let's denote the number of sheep in Seattle as \( S \), in Charleston as \( C \), and in Toulouse as \( T \).

Given:
- Seattle has 20 sheep, so \( S = 20 \).
- Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so \( C = 4S \).
- Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so \( T = 2C \).

First, calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:
\[ C = 4S = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:
\[ T = 2C = 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Now, add the number of sheep in all three cities:
\[ S + C + T = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 \]

The total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the 200 GB file.
2. Add the time taken for the Windows restart.
3. Add the time to download the entire 200 GB file again.

First, calculate 40% of the 200 GB file:
\[ 0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB} \]

Next, calculate the time to download 80 GB at a rate of 2 GB/minute:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, add the 20 minutes for the Windows restart:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, add the time to download the entire 200 GB file again:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Total time:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \text{ minutes} \]

"First, let's calculate the distance John initially travels away from home. He drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how far John travels back home during the 4 hours. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.

For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

For the remaining 1.5 hours (since 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours), he drives at 80 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances he traveled back home:

\[ \text{Total distance back home} = 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we subtract the distance he traveled back home from the initial distance he traveled away from home:

\[ \text{Distance from home} = 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider both her regular pay and her overtime pay.

1. **Regular Pay Calculation:**
   - Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour.
   - She works 40 hours at this rate.
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Pay Calculation:**
   - Eliza worked 45 hours in total, so she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours of overtime.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and see when the total net profit becomes positive.

1. **Initial Cost**: The initial cost to plant the tree is $90.
2. **Annual Revenue**: Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each.
   - Annual revenue = 7 lemons * $1.5/lemon = $10.5
3. **Annual Cost**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.
   - Annual net profit = Annual revenue - Annual cost = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

4. **Total Net Profit Calculation**:
   - We need to find the number of years \( n \) such that the total net profit is at least equal to the initial cost.
   - Total net profit after \( n \) years = \( n \times $7.5 \)
   - We set up the equation: \( n \times $7.5 = $90 \)
   - Solving for \( n \): \( n = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \)

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house:
   \[
   \text{Vacuums sold at green house} = \frac{x}{3}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Vacuums left after green house} = x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house:
   \[
   \text{Vacuums left after red house} = \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house:
   \[
   \text{Vacuums sold at orange house} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Vacuums left after orange house} = \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Vacuums left after orange house} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

4. We know that after the orange house, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

5. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we first need to calculate the total time she should take to complete the 12-mile trail.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given:
- Total Distance = 12 miles
- Desired Average Speed = 4 miles per hour

We can rearrange the formula to solve for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours hiking the first 6 miles. Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the trail is:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = \text{Total Time} - \text{Time Already Spent} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to cover is:
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = \text{Total Distance} - \text{Distance Already Covered} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the required speed for the remaining distance:
\[ \text{Required Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} \]
\[ \text{Required Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} \]
\[ \text{Required Speed} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

"First, let's determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water:
\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we account for the spill. Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, the remaining amount of orange drink is:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Now, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water:
\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

When we mix the remaining 9 liters of orange drink with the 15 liters of pineapple drink, the total volume is:
\[ 9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water in the 24 liters of the mixed drink is:
\[ 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:

1. The first friend's guess is 80.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now, we calculate the average of these three guesses:
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80

"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total hours per day John spends on the dogs.
2. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in a week.

Step 1: Total hours per day
Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of, and John has 10 dogs.
So, \( 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \).

Step 2: Total hours per week
There are 7 days in a week, so:
\( 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \).

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins (\( S = 40 \)), we can find the number of gold coins (\( G \)):
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Adding 5 more jewels to this amount gives us the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has:

\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in each half of his ping pong session and then sum them up.

1. In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.
2. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. 

To find 25% more points:
- 25% of 4 points is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \) point.
- Therefore, in the second 20 minutes, he scores \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) points.

Now, we add the points from both halves:
- Total points = Points in the first 20 minutes + Points in the second 20 minutes
- Total points = 4 + 5 = 9

Thus, the total points Mike scored is 9.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours, given the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

18 miles"

"First, let's determine the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips. Since there are 5 servings in the bag and each serving has 250 calories, the total number of calories in the bag is:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily target of 2000 calories. You have already consumed 1800 calories, so:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories. Since each serving is 250 calories and the bag is 300g with 5 servings, each serving is:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ g}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 60 \text{ g/serving} \]

To find out how many grams of chips 200 calories represent, we use the ratio of calories to grams in a serving:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} \times 60 \text{ g/serving} = 48 \text{ g} \]

Therefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice used.
2. Calculate the number of Post-it notes she had initially plus the number in the package.
3. Subtract the number of Post-it notes remaining from the total to find the number in the package.

First, we know that Candice placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. Therefore, she used 220 Post-it notes.

Next, we know that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining after placing the notes on the cups. This means the total number of Post-it notes she had before using them is the sum of the Post-it notes she used and the Post-it notes she had left:

\[ \text{Total Post-it notes} = \text{Post-it notes used} + \text{Post-it notes remaining} \]
\[ \text{Total Post-it notes} = 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes she had before using them is:

\[ 80 + x = 243 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x = 243 - 80 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased is:

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties:

Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. The cost of each blue tie is $40, so:

Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + 50% of cost per blue tie
Cost per red tie = $40 + 0.5 * $40
Cost per red tie = $40 + $20
Cost per red tie = $60

Now, we calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total spent on red ties = $600

Finally, we add the amount spent on blue ties to the amount spent on red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
Total spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total spent on ties = $800

"To determine how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones without interest.
2. Calculate the total interest for all the cell phones.
3. Add the total interest to the total cost to get the total amount to be paid.
4. Divide the total amount by the number of months (3) to find the monthly payment.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cell phones without interest.
- Shiela bought 5 cell phones at $150 each.
- Total cost = 5 * $150 = $750

Step 2: Calculate the total interest for all the cell phones.

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first 180 days and the remaining days of the year.

1. **First 180 days:**
   - The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day.
   - Total food for 180 days: \( 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \).

2. **Remaining days of the year:**
   - A year has 365 days.
   - Remaining days after the first 180 days: \( 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \).
   - The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day.
   - Total food for 185 days: \( 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \).

3. **Total food for the first year:**
   - Total food for the first 180 days: 180 cups.
   - Total food for the remaining 185 days: 370 cups.
   - Total food for the year: \( 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \).

4. **Number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
   - Number of bags required: \( \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \).

"First, we determine how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Sarah's laundry} = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:

\[ 400 = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Solving for David's laundry:

\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we determine how much laundry Raymond does. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Sarah's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the total cost of buying the flowers in packages of 3 and in packages of 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) packages.
- The total cost for 6 packages is \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) packages.
- The total cost for 9 packages is \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Now, we compare the two total costs:
- The cost for packages of 3 is $15.
- The cost for packages of 2 is $9.

The savings by buying the flowers in packages of 2 instead of packages of 3 is:
\[ 15 - 9 = 6 \]

Therefore, Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Next, solve for \( L \):
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, substitute \( L = 7 \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drove through in the first 15 minutes.
3. 20 more cars drove through in the next 15 minutes.
4. 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.

Let \( x \) be the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5 (those that took the exit).

The total number of cars initially is the sum of the cars that drove through and the cars that took the exit:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

"First, let's determine the total number of potted plants Mary has initially. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, which gives:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, she received 18 new potted plants, so the total number of potted plants she has now is:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary decides to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family. Since there are 40 ledges, she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these values.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell:
   \[
   20 + \left(\frac{1}{4} \times 20\right) = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ times}
   \]
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means the third friend pressed the doorbell:
   \[
   60 + 10 = 70 \text{ times}
   \]

Now, we sum the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
\[
20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175
\]

Thus, the total number of doorbell rings is:

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box and then find the volume of one box. Finally, we multiply that volume by 3 to get the total volume for all 3 boxes.

1. **Calculate the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) inches
   - Inner width: \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) inches
   - Inner height: \( 4 - 2 = 2 \) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - Volume = length × width × height
   - Volume of one box = \( 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \) cubic inches

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can start by calculating the total time he spent watching TV from Monday to Friday and then isolate the time spent on Wednesday.

1. **Monday and Tuesday:**
   - Each day, he watched a 1-hour episode.
   - Total for Monday and Tuesday: \(1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}\).

2. **Wednesday:**
   - Let \(x\) be the number of 30-minute episodes he watched.
   - Total time on Wednesday: \(0.5x \text{ hours}\).

3. **Thursday:**
   - He watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
   - Total for Thursday: \(1 \text{ hour} + 0.5 \text{ hour} = 1.5 \text{ hours}\).

4. **Friday:**
   - He watched two 1-hour episodes.
   - Total for Friday: \(1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}\).

5. **Total time spent watching TV:**
   - Sum of all days: \(2 \text{ hours} + 0.5x \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 7 \text{ hours}\).

Now, we can set up the equation and solve for \(x\):

\[
2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7
\]

Combine the constants:

\[
5.5 + 0.5x = 7
\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[
0.5x = 1.5
\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[
x = 3

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue she will make from selling it at the new price.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- She has 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10, each costing $10.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]
- She has 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10, each costing $16.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]
- The total cost of all the lumber is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the selling price of the lumber, which has increased by 50%:
- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15/\text{board}

"First, let's determine Lylah's salary four years ago. If Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]
\[ 40000 = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

Solving for Lylah's salary:
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = 30769.23 \]

Next, we calculate Adrien's salary four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Assuming Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), we calculate her new salary:
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add the new salaries of Adrien and Lylah to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:
\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

"Let's denote the total number of french fries Dave bought as \( F \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries in total.
4. After the seagull and pigeons, the number of fries left is \( F - 14 - 7 - 9 = F - 30 \).
5. A raccoon then stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, so the raccoon ate \( \frac{2}{3} (F - 30) \) fries.
6. After the raccoon, the number of fries left is \( \frac{1}{3} (F - 30) \).
7. Ants carried off one more fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, \( \frac{1}{3} (F - 30) - 1 = 5 \).

Now, solve for \( F \):

\[
\frac{1}{3} (F - 30) - 1 = 5
\]

Add 1 to both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{3} (F - 30) = 6
\]

Multiply both sides by 3:

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial price and the increase interval:**
   - Initial price = $20
   - Increase interval = every 2 months
   - Increase rate = 20% of the original price

2. **Calculate the number of increases over 36 months:**
   - 36 months / 2 months per increase = 18 increases

3. **Determine the multiplier for each increase:**
   - Each increase is 20% of the original price, so the multiplier for each increase is 1 + 0.20 = 1.20

4. **Calculate the final price after 18 increases:**
   - The formula for the final price after multiple increases is:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (\text{Multiplier})^{\text{Number of Increases}}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
     \]

5. **Compute the value:**
   - Using a calculator to find \( (1.20)^{18} \):
     \[
     (1.20)^{18} \approx 38.3376

"Let's denote Seth's current age as \( S \) and Brooke's current age as \( B \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 8 \) back into the equation \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then determine how much more likely one event is compared to the other, expressed as a percentage.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \]

### Step 3: Determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
We need to find the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

To express this as a percentage, we calculate:
\[ (2 - 1) \times 100\% = 1 \times 100\% = 100\% \]

Thus, it is 100% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of rats in each cage based on the total distribution of straw.

1. **Calculate the total straw used for the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces of straw.

2. **Calculate the total straw used for the rabbits:**
   - There is a pen of rabbits with 20 pieces of straw distributed.
   - Total straw for rabbits = 20 pieces of straw.

3. **Calculate the total straw used for the rats:**
   - The total straw distributed among all the small rodents is 160 pieces.
   - Total straw for rats = Total straw - (Straw for hamsters + Straw for rabbits)
   - Total straw for rats = 160 pieces - (50 pieces + 20 pieces) = 90 pieces of straw.

4. **Determine the number of rats:**
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Number of rats = Total straw for rats / Straw per rat
   - Number of rats = 90 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 15 rats.

5. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups.
   - Number of rats in each cage = Total number of rats / Number of cages
   - Number of rats in each cage = 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats/cage.

The number of rats in each cage is 5.

"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is invested or borrowed for.

Given:
- \( P = 100 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% monthly interest)

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ A = 100 (1 + 0.02)^3 \]

Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first:

\[ 1 + 0.02 = 1.02 \]

Now, raise 1.02 to the power of 3:

\[ 1.02^3 = 1.061208 \]

Finally, multiply this result by the principal amount:

\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, Mandy should give Benedict:

"To determine how many trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net number of trees added each year.
2. Determine the total number of trees after 10 years.
3. Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.
4. Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees after 10 years.

Step 1: Calculate the net number of trees added each year.
Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year.
Net trees added per year = 10 - 2 = 8 trees

Step 2: Determine the total number of trees after 10 years.
Starting with 50 trees, the total number of trees after 10 years is:
Total trees = Initial trees + (Net trees added per year * Number of years)
Total trees = 50 + (8 * 10) = 50 + 80 = 130 trees

Step 3: Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.
30% of the trees die.
Number of trees that die = 30% of 130 = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees

Step 4: Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees after 10 years.
Number of trees left = Total trees - Number of trees that die
Number of trees left = 130 - 39 = 91 trees

"To find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has now in total, we need to follow the sequence of her card collections over the three months and sum them up.

1. **Initial number of cards**: Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. **First month collection**: She collected three times the initial number of cards.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]
3. **Second month collection**: She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
   \]
4. **Third month collection**: She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the cards she has collected over the three months and the initial number of cards:
\[
20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320
\]

Thus, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates is 6 plates.
   - Total cost of half a dozen plates = 6 plates * $6000/plate = $36000.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Total cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

3. **Calculate the cost per cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
   - Cost per cup = Total cost of twenty dozen cups / Number of cups = $34800 / 240 cups = $145.

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The cost of the jacket is $30, and the cost of each pair of shoes is $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the additional amount she needs is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her total earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her initial savings:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Now, the remaining amount she needs to earn is:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn:
\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day.
2. The white chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

We can set up the equation for the total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substitute \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substitute the perimeter \( d = 15 \) miles and the speed \( v = 3 \) miles per hour:

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the first day.
2. Calculate the number of customers on the second day.
3. Use the total number of customers over the three days to find the number of customers on the third day.

From the problem:
- The number of customers on the first day is 100.
- The number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day, which is \(100 + 50 = 150\).
- The total number of customers over the three days is 500.

Let \( x \) be the number of customers on the third day. The equation for the total number of customers over the three days is:
\[ 100 + 150 + x = 500 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 250 + x = 500 \]
\[ x = 500 - 250 \]
\[ x = 250 \]

So, the number of customers on the third day is 250.

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

Given that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons) and the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

So, the total amount she needs to pay back is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount she will pay over 12 months if she pays $165 each month:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to pay back:

"First, we calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest when Ashlyn first visited the farm. This is 30% of 120 watermelons:
\[ 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \text{ watermelons} \]

After taking these 36 watermelons, the number of watermelons remaining on the farm is:
\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \text{ watermelons} \]

When Ashlyn returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest:
\[ 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \text{ watermelons} \]

After harvesting these 63 watermelons, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested is:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \text{ watermelons} \]

"To find out how much Mark pays for everything, we need to calculate the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

1. **Cost of the cars:**
   - Each car costs $20,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Total cost of the cars = 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

2. **Tax on the cars:**
   - The tax rate is 10%.
   - Total tax = 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.

3. **Registration fees:**
   - Each car has a registration fee of $1,000.
   - Total registration fees = 12 * $1,000 = $12,000.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the cars + Tax + Registration fees
   - Total cost = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is $276,000.

"To determine how many vines Steve needs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tomatoes Steve eats per week.
2. Determine the number of tomatoes his girlfriend eats per week.
3. Calculate the total number of tomatoes both of them eat per week.
4. Determine how many vines are needed to produce that many tomatoes.

First, we know that Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Therefore, in a week (7 days), he eats:
\[ 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{2} = 21 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Together, they eat:
\[ 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} + 21 \text{ tomatoes/week} = 63 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. Therefore, the number of vines needed is:
\[ \frac{63 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}} = 21 \text{ vines} \]

So, Steve needs 21 vines.

"First, let's determine how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} = 54 \]

Solving for Robert's candies:

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Next, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we can calculate the number of candies James has:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. We subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

   - He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
   - Therefore, he currently has \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) pen pals.

2. **Determine the number of letters Mike receives each week:**
   - Each of his 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week.
   - Therefore, he receives \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) letters a week.

3. **Calculate the total number of pages Mike receives each week:**
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - Therefore, he receives \( 6 \times 5 = 30 \) pages a week.

4. **Determine the number of pages Mike writes in response:**
   - Mike responds to each letter with a letter of the same length.
   - Therefore, he writes \( 30 \) pages a week in response.

5. **Calculate the time Mike spends writing each week:**
   - Mike can write 1 page every 6 minutes.
   - Therefore, to write 30 pages, he spends \( 30 \times 6 = 180 \) minutes.

6. **Convert the time spent writing from minutes to hours:**

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial fries Griffin had:**
   - Griffin started with 24 fries.

2. **Fries taken by Kyle:**
   - Kyle took 5 fries.
   - Remaining fries: \( 24 - 5 = 19 \)

3. **Fries taken by Billy:**
   - Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) fries.
   - Remaining fries: \( 19 - 10 = 9 \)

4. **Fries given by Ginger:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin.
   - After receiving fries from Ginger, Griffin had \( 9 + x \) fries.

5. **Fries taken by Colby:**
   - Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, so Colby took \( 5 - 3 = 2 \) fries.
   - Remaining fries after Colby took some: \( 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x \)

6. **Final number of fries Griffin had:**
   - According to the problem, Griffin ended up with 27 fries.
   - Therefore, \( 7 + x = 27 \)

7. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( 7 + x = 27 \)
   - \( x = 27 - 7 \)
   - \( x = 20 \)

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: \( A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \)
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: \( J_b = J_a + 4 \)
4. Andrea has 52 apples: \( A_a = 52 \)

First, we use the information that Andrea has 52 apples to find the number of apples Jamal has:
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Next, we use the number of apples Jamal has to find the number of bananas Jamal has:

"To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

1. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.05 \times 350,000 = \$17,500
   \]

2. **Calculate the transfer fee:**
   \[
   \text{Transfer fee} = 12\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.12 \times 350,000 = \$42,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the house:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Selling price} + \text{Brokerage fee} + \text{Transfer fee} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = \$409,500
   \]

4. **Determine how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Budget} = 409,500 - 400,000 = \$9,500

"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to account for the transfer fees, brokerage fees, and the remaining loan amount he paid.

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   \[
   \text{Transfer fees} = 3\% \text{ of } \$400,000 = 0.03 \times 400,000 = \$12,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fees:**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fees} = 5\% \text{ of } \$400,000 = 0.05 \times 400,000 = \$20,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total fees:**
   \[
   \text{Total fees} = \text{Transfer fees} + \text{Brokerage fees} = \$12,000 + \$20,000 = \$32,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount paid:**
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = \text{Remaining loan amount} + \text{Total fees} = \$250,000 + \$32,000 = \$282,000
   \]

5. **Calculate the net proceeds:**
   \[
   \text{Net proceeds} = \text{Selling price} - \text{Total amount paid} = \$400,000 - \$282,000 = \$118,000

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Time to heat oil to 300 degrees:**
   - It takes 20 minutes.

2. **Time to heat oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees:**
   - It takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \( 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat from 300 to 400 degrees is \( 20 + 8 = 28 \) minutes.

3. **Total time to heat the oil:**
   - The total time to heat the oil from the start to 400 degrees is \( 20 + 28 = 48 \) minutes.

4. **Time to cook the chicken:**
   - It takes 5 minutes less than the time it took to warm up the oil.
   - The time to cook the chicken is \( 48 - 5 = 43 \) minutes.

5. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:**
   - The total time is the sum of the time to heat the oil and the time to cook the chicken.
   - Total time = \( 48 + 43 = 91 \) minutes.

Therefore, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 91 minutes.

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, let's break down the information given:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches: \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar: \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.
4. The total number of stitches for the entire sweater is 1800.

First, we calculate the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 \text{ (body)} + 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 1170 \text{ stitches} \]

Next, we subtract this from the total number of stitches to find the number of stitches used for the two sleeves:
\[ 1800 \text{ (total)} - 1170 \text{ (body, collar, rosette)} = 630 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2 to find the number of stitches per sleeve:
\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \text{ stitches per sleeve} \]

Thus, each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we start with the information that the sum of their current ages is 20.

1. Let \( M \) be Mico's current age and \( N \) be Marco's current age.
2. According to the problem, \( M + N = 20 \).

In 10 years:
- Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \).
- Marco's age will be \( N + 10 \).

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ (M + 10) + (N + 10) \]

Simplifying this expression:
\[ M + N + 10 + 10 = M + N + 20 \]

Since \( M + N = 20 \):

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Currently, Cera is 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.
   - Therefore, Noah's age six years ago was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Noah's age six years ago was 20.
   - Therefore, the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60,000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Therefore, \(60,000 = \frac{P}{2}\).

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

3. At the second stop, 7 people got off and 8 people got on. Therefore, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We know that after the second stop, there were 20 people on the bus:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school:
   \( 24 - 2 = 22 \) lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends:
   \( 22 - 14 = 8 \) lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends:
   \( 14 \times 2 = 28 \) lollipops bought.
5. Adding the lollipops he bought to the ones he has left:
   \( 8 + 28 = 36 \) lollipops.
6. He eats 3 lollipops that night:
   \( 36 - 3 = 33 \) lollipops left.
7. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning:

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge required:

100% - 60% = 40%

Next, we know the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. Therefore, to charge 40 percentage-points, the time required is:

40 percentage-points * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

This means the customer had $4 off to use on their next shopping trip. 

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 before any discounts. They used their $4 reward, and the coupon took twice the amount of the reward off the price. 

\[ \text{Coupon discount} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total discount applied:

\[ \text{Total discount} = 4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total discount from the original amount spent:

\[ \text{Amount paid} = 43 - 12 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine which job offers Nick a higher net pay and by how much, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs after accounting for taxes and other deductions.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Annual hours: 2000
- Annual gross pay: \( 15 \times 2000 = 30,000 \)
- State tax rate: 20%
- Annual state tax: \( 30,000 \times 0.20 = 6,000 \)
- Net pay: \( 30,000 - 6,000 = 24,000 \)

**Job B:**
- Annual gross pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: \( 42,000 - 6,000 = 36,000 \)
- State tax rate: 10%
- Annual state tax: \( 36,000 \times 0.10 = 3,600 \)
- Net pay: \( 36,000 - 3,600 = 32,400 \)

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
\[ 32,400 - 24,000 = 8,400 \]

Thus, Nick will make $8,400 more at Job B compared to Job A.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chickens and cows Farmer Brown has, and then calculate the total number of legs.

1. Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \).
2. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is \( 2C \).
3. The total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   C + 2C = 60
   \]
4. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   3C = 60
   \]
5. Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = \frac{60}{3} = 20
   \]
6. Therefore, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

Next, we calculate the total number of legs:
- Each cow has 4 legs, so the total number of legs for the cows is \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \).
- Each chicken has 2 legs, so the total number of legs for the chickens is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \).

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. A pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. A blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
3. A green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
4. A yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. A red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself, which is 20 pounds.

Total weight = (weight of pink frog) + (weight of blue beetle) + (weight of green toad) + (weight of yellow snake) + (weight of red bird) + (weight of container)
Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20

"To determine how many pounds of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to calculate the amount of stuffing required for a collie bed. 

A bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and a bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing. The amount of stuffing for a collie bed is the average of these two amounts:

\[
\text{Stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

\[
\text{Total stuffing for collie beds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Adding these together gives the total amount of stuffing needed:

\[
\text{Total stuffing} = 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

"Let's denote the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( M \). According to the problem, \( M = 3 \).

The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is given by \( 4M - 5 \). Substituting \( M = 3 \):
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

The number of people kicked out for physical violence is three times the number of shoplifters:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we know the total number of people kicked out is 50. We can set up the equation to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons:
\[ M + \text{shoplifters} + \text{physical violence} + \text{other reasons} = 50 \]
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 + \text{other reasons} = 50 \]
\[ 31 + \text{other reasons} = 50 \]
\[ \text{other reasons} = 50 - 31 \]
\[ \text{other reasons} = 19 \]

"First, we calculate how many slices Bill and Mark each receive.

Bill receives 1/3 of the pizza:
12 slices * 1/3 = 4 slices

Mark receives 1/4 of the pizza:
12 slices * 1/4 = 3 slices

Next, we add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
4 slices + 3 slices = 7 slices

Jenny eats 2 slices, so we add these to the slices given away:
7 slices + 2 slices = 9 slices

Finally, we subtract the total slices given away and eaten from the original number of slices:
12 slices - 9 slices = 3 slices

"To find the total number of bugs Nancy counted, we need to calculate the number of each type of bug and then sum them up.

1. **Spiders**: Nancy saw 90 spiders.
2. **Millipedes**: The number of millipedes is 1/3rd the number of spiders. 
   \[
   \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
   \]
3. **Stink Bugs**: The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12.
   \[
   \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
   \]

Now, we sum up the number of each type of bug:
\[
\text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168

"To determine how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner:
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts (0.9 kilowatts) per hour.
   - Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day.
   - Daily energy consumption = 0.9 kilowatts/hour * 8 hours = 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh).

2. Calculate the reduced daily energy consumption:
   - If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, he will use the air conditioner for 3 hours a day.
   - Reduced daily energy consumption = 0.9 kilowatts/hour * 3 hours = 2.7 kilowatt-hours (kWh).

3. Calculate the daily energy savings:
   - Daily energy savings = Original daily consumption - Reduced daily consumption
   - Daily energy savings = 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh.

"To determine how much Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sandwiches needed to serve 20 people.
2. Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.
3. Calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of sandwiches needed.**
Each sandwich serves 4 people. Therefore, for 20 people:
\[ \text{Number of sandwiches} = \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.**
Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches:
\[ \text{Total meat required} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{Total cheese required} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese.**
The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound, and the cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound. Therefore:
\[ \text{Total cost of meat} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 7 \text{ dollars per pound} = 35 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Total cost of cheese} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 3 \text{ dollars per pound} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 35 \text{ dollars} + 15 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is:

"First, let's determine the initial number of corns and cannolis at Allan's house.

1. Allan has 40 cannolis.
2. There is twice as much corn as cannolis, so the number of corns is \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \).

Next, Allan buys more cannolis and corns:
3. He buys 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is \( 40 + 60 = 100 \).
4. He buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he now has, so the number of corns he buys is \( 100 - 40 = 60 \).

Now, let's find the new total number of corns:
5. The new total number of corns is \( 80 + 60 = 140 \).

Finally, we find the combined total of corns and cannolis:
6. The combined total is \( 140 + 100 = 240 \).

"Elliott's total goal is 10,000 steps. He completed half of his steps to and from school, which is 5,000 steps. He also did 1,000 steps walking with his friend. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. 

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we can calculate the total steps taken before the jog and subtract this from the total steps minus the remaining steps:

Total steps before the jog = 5,000 (to and from school) + 1,000 (with friend) = 6,000 steps.
Total steps needed to reach the goal = 10,000 - 2,000 (remaining) = 8,000 steps.

Therefore, the steps taken during the jog = 8,000 (total needed) - 6,000 (before the jog) = 2,000 steps.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( c \) represent the number of camels.
2. Let \( d \) represent the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know:
- The total number of heads (camels and dromedaries) is 180.
- The total number of humps (camels have 2 humps each, dromedaries have 1 hump each) is 304.

We can write the following equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \) (total number of humps)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( d \):
\[ d = 180 - c \]

Next, substitute \( d \) in the second equation:
\[ 2c + (180 - c) = 304 \]
\[ 2c + 180 - c = 304 \]
\[ c + 180 = 304 \]
\[ c = 304 - 180 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now, substitute \( c = 124 \) back into the equation \( d = 180 - c \):
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars, came from the tattered jeans.

4. **Determine the original prices of the jeans:**
   - Let \( P_t \) be the original price of the tattered jeans.
   - Let \( P_j \) be the original price of the jogger jeans.
   - The tattered jeans were bought for $28, so the savings from the tattered jeans is \( P_t - 28 = 4 \).
   - Therefore, \( P_t = 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The jogger jeans were bought for $22, so the savings from the jogger jeans is \( P_j - 22 = 2 \).
   - Therefore, \( P_j = 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 more than the tattered jeans.

"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted by both the homemade and store-bought bird feeders.

1. **Number of homemade bird feeders**: 3
2. **Number of store-bought bird feeders**: 3
3. **Birds attracted by each store-bought feeder**: 20
4. **Birds attracted by each homemade feeder**: 20 + 10 = 30

Next, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ homemade feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 90 \text{ birds} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ store-bought feeders} \times 20 \text{ birds per feeder} = 60 \text{ birds} \]

Finally, we add the two totals together to find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see each day:
\[ 90 \text{ birds} + 60 \text{ birds} = 150 \text{ birds} \]

"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the bagel**: $4
2. **Cost of the soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. 
   - 25% of $4 is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \)
   - Therefore, the cost of the soup is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) dollars.
3. **Cost of the cake**: The cake costs half the price of the bagel.
   - Half of $4 is \( 4 / 2 = 2 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Pokemon cards Kenny started with. Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( C \).

1. Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards.
2. Each card is sold for $1.5.
3. The total amount of money he makes from selling the cards is \( \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 \).
4. This amount of money is enough to buy the $100 ticket and leave him with $50 in spending cash, so the total amount of money he makes is $150.

We can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \]
\[ C = 150 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - Therefore, he prepared 18 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 36 hotdogs for the second hotdogs.
   - Additionally, he prepared 1 hotdog for each of the remaining 18 guests.
   - Total hotdogs prepared = 36 (for second hotdogs) + 18 (for first hotdogs) = 54 hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Total hotdogs needed = 40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only had 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short = 80 (needed) - 54 (prepared) = 26 hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest wanted a second hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is equal to the number of hotdogs short.
   - Therefore, 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

"To find out how much Charlotte's order cost after the 20% discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.
2. Apply the 20% discount to the total cost.
3. Calculate the final cost after the discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:
- The set of pots and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Adding these together:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:
- 20% of $165.00 is calculated as \( 0.20 \times 165.00 = 33.00 \).

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

So, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ 132.00 \]

132.00"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Bernadette to reach the theater and then calculate how much earlier she should leave compared to Wayne.

1. **Determine Wayne's travel time:**
   - Wayne's travel time to the theater is 4 minutes.

2. **Determine Bernadette's travel time:**
   - Bernadette's travel time is four times Wayne's travel time.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's travel time is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) minutes.

3. **Calculate the time difference:**
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
   - Wayne arrives at the theater at time \( T \).
   - Bernadette needs to arrive at \( T - 5 \) minutes.
   - Since Bernadette's travel time is 16 minutes, she needs to leave 16 minutes before \( T - 5 \).

4. **Determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave:**
   - Wayne leaves at time \( T - 4 \) (since his travel time is 4 minutes).
   - Bernadette needs to leave at \( T - 5 - 16 = T - 21 \) minutes.
   - The difference in their departure times is \( (T - 4) - (T - 21) = 17 \) minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the length of the room from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
   \[
   3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. Use the area formula for a rectangle to find the width of the room. The area \(A\) of a rectangle is given by:
   \[
   A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
   \]
   Given that the area \(A\) is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:
   \[
   360 = 9 \times \text{width}
   \]
   \[
   \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. Calculate the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet}

"To determine how many more beads one sister has than the other, we first need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought.**
- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack contains 20 beads.

Total beads Elizabeth bought:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} \]
\[ = 20 + 40 \]
\[ = 60 \text{ beads} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought.**
- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack contains 20 beads.

Total beads Margareth bought:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} + 4 \text{ packs of red} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} \]
\[ = 60 + 80 \]
\[ = 140 \text{ beads} \]

**Step 3: Determine the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters.**
\[ 140 \text{ beads (Margareth)} - 60 \text{ beads (Elizabeth)} \]
\[ = 80 \text{ beads} \]

Thus, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to Marcus baking. He bakes for 3 hours, and each hour the temperature increases by 5 degrees.

Temperature increase from baking = 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. After baking, the temperature is:

Initial temperature + Temperature increase from baking = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

Next, Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. 

Cooling rate = 2 degrees/10 minutes
Total cooling = (30 minutes / 10 minutes) * 2 degrees = 3 * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

The final temperature of the house after cooling is:

Temperature after baking - Total cooling = 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it took James to complete the triathlon and then find out how long it took him to run.

First, let's calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James took:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time it took James to complete each segment of the triathlon:
- James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. Jon's swim time is 40 minutes, so James's swim time is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

- James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Jon's bike time is 80 minutes, so James's bike time is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know the total time for James and the times for the swim and bike segments. We can find the time it took James to run by subtracting the swim and bike times from the total time:
\[ 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[ 59 \text{ minutes} \]

"First, let's determine how far the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

1 hour = 60 minutes
30 minutes = 0.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 32 MPH × 0.5 hours = 16 miles

Next, we calculate the amount of hay the horse will eat for running 16 miles.

For every mile, the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay.
For 16 miles, the horse will eat:
16 miles × 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails of hay

Now, we calculate the cost of 8 bails of hay.

Cost of 1 bail of hay = $3
Cost of 8 bails of hay = 8 bails × $3/bail = $24

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, so he has:
6 × $5 = $30

Finally, we calculate the change Michael will have after buying the hay.

Change = Total money - Cost of hay
Change = $30 - $24 = $6

"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed:
\[ V = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each 1 pound.
   - Total weight = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each 12 pounds.
   - Total weight = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each 75 pounds.
   - Total weight = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each 65 pounds.
   - Total weight = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Next, we sum the weights of all the feed:
- Total weight = 2 (sugar cubes) + 48 (carrots) + 3150 (hay) + 1300 (oats)
- Total weight = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since partial trips are not possible).

- Number of trips = 4500 / 2250 = 2.

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set up the equation:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we will convert the remoras' lengths from inches to feet.
2. Calculate the combined length of the remoras.
3. Determine the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents.

First, convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet:
- Each remora is 6 inches long.
- There are 12 inches in a foot, so 6 inches is \( \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \) feet.

Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

Next, calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents:
- The shark is 10 feet long.
- The combined length of the remoras is 1 foot.

The percentage is calculated as:
\[ \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100\% = 10\% \]

Therefore, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Brett's age in four years:**
   Brett is currently 14 years old. In four years, he will be:
   \[
   14 + 4 = 18 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. **Set up the equation for Angela's age:**
   In four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Brett is currently 14 years old, so three times his current age is:
   \[
   3 \times 14 = 42
   \]
   This means that in four years, Angela will be 42 years old.

3. **Determine Angela's current age:**
   If Angela will be 42 years old in four years, her current age is:
   \[
   42 - 4 = 38 \text{ years old}
   \]

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old.

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = 10 \]

Thus, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \), by Lily as \( L \), and by Bodhi as \( B \).

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \) (total insects collected)
2. \( L = D + 7 \) (Lily found 7 more than David)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) (David found half of what Bodhi found)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \) using equation 3:
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, substitute \( B = 2D \) and \( L = D + 7 \) into equation 1:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, substitute \( D = 9 \) back into the equation for \( L \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Thus, Lily found 16 insects.

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of the skein they each used and then convert that to yards.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. First, we add these fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

So, together they used \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein of yarn.

Next, we need to convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein to yards. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we calculate:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273
\]

Therefore, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

   - One person can paint \(\frac{1}{10}\) of a house per day.

3. **Determine the combined rate for 5 people:**
   - If one person can paint \(\frac{1}{10}\) of a house per day, then 5 people can paint \(5 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2}\) of a house per day.

4. **Calculate the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house:**
   - If 5 people can paint \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a house per day, then it will take them \(\frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}} = 2\) days to paint a whole house.

5. **Convert days to hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day, so 2 days is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"Let's start by defining the variables and relationships given in the problem:

- Let \( C_O \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has.
- Let \( S_O \) be the number of sofas Ophelia has.
- Let \( C_J \) be the number of chairs Jenna has.
- Let \( S_J \) be the number of sofas Jenna has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Ophelia has 20 sofas: \( S_O = 20 \).
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_O = C_O - 2 \).
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia: \( C_J = 3C_O \).
4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_J = C_J - 2 \).

First, we solve for \( C_O \) using the information about Ophelia's sofas and chairs:
\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Next, we find \( C_J \) using the relationship between Jenna's and Ophelia's chairs:
\[ C_J = 3C_O \]
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]

Now, we find \( S_J \) using the relationship between Jenna's sofas and chairs:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
\[ \text{Total sofas} = S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we can break down the information given:

1. Josh worked out for 4 hours each week for most of the weeks.
2. There were two consecutive weeks where he worked out for 5 hours each week.
3. There was one week where he worked out for 6 hours.

First, calculate the total hours for the weeks he worked out 4 hours:
- There are 8 weeks in total.
- He worked out 5 hours for 2 weeks and 6 hours for 1 week, which totals 3 weeks.
- Therefore, the number of weeks he worked out 4 hours is \(8 - 3 = 5\) weeks.

Calculate the total hours for the 5 weeks he worked out 4 hours:
\[ 5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Next, calculate the total hours for the 2 weeks he worked out 5 hours:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, calculate the total hours for the 1 week he worked out 6 hours:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, add all these hours together to get the total:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

The total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40 \text{ passengers remain}
   \]
3. 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ passengers get on}
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80 \text{ passengers}
   \]
5. On the second stop, 21 passengers get off:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59 \text{ passengers remain}
   \]
6. 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus. This means 1/3 of the number who got off get on:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ passengers get on}
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66 \text{ passengers}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.

3. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \).

4. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \).

5. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - The current age difference is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \).

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:

"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to determine the cost of the printer and then use the total cost to find the cost of the monitors.

1. The cost of the computer is given as $1,100.
2. The printer cost $400 less than the computer, so the cost of the printer is:
   \[
   1100 - 400 = 700
   \]
3. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can set up the equation:
   \[
   1100 + 2 \times \text{cost of one monitor} + 700 = 2400
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   1800 + 2 \times \text{cost of one monitor} = 2400
   \]
5. Subtract 1800 from both sides to isolate the term with the cost of the monitors:
   \[
   2 \times \text{cost of one monitor} = 600
   \]
6. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for the cost of one monitor:
   \[
   \text{cost of one monitor} = 300
   \]

The cost of one monitor is \(300\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of seashells each girl brought back.

1. First, we know that the boys brought back 60 shells each.
2. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

Let's denote the number of shells each boy brought as \( B \). According to the problem, \( B = 60 \).

The number of shells each girl brought is given by:
\[ G = B + 4B \]
\[ G = 60 + 4 \times 60 \]
\[ G = 60 + 240 \]
\[ G = 300 \]

So, each girl brought back 300 seashells.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books:

"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to complete to reach her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we first need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

1. Vlogs made in the first week: 18
2. Vlogs made in the second week: 21
3. Vlogs made in the third week: 15

Adding these together gives:
\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs in a month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:
\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

Therefore, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

"To solve this, first calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill:

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

So the total bill including the tip is:

$50 + $10 = $60

Since the bill is to be split evenly, the initial share for each person is:

$50 / 2 = $25

However, since you are paying the entire tip, you need to add the full tip amount to your share:

$25 (your half of the bill) + $10 (the tip) = $35

Therefore, you end up paying $35.

   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his share: \( 6 + 5 = 11 \) dollars.
   - The next day, he adds another $10: \( 11 + 10 = 21 \) dollars.
   - He spends $8: \( 21 - 8 = 13 \) dollars.
   - He then triples the remaining amount: \( 13 \times 3 = 39 \) dollars.

So, the eldest boy now has 39 dollars.

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Shiloh's current age \( S = 44 \).
2. In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \).
3. In 7 years, his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substitute \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
2. Calculate the total number of roses the flower shops order in a month.
3. Compare the two totals to find the difference.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month
Ford grows 40 roses every week. There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.

\[
40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 160 \text{ roses/month}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of roses the flower shops order in a month
The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week, the second orders 15 roses per week, and the third orders 30 roses per week.

\[
20 \text{ roses/week} + 15 \text{ roses/week} + 30 \text{ roses/week} = 65 \text{ roses/week}
\]

Now, calculate the total for a month:

\[
65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 260 \text{ roses/month}
\]

### Step 3: Compare the two totals to find the difference
Ford grows 160 roses per month, but the flower shops order 260 roses per month.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off when set to 450 degrees. The actual temperature is 468 degrees, so the oven is overheating by 18 degrees.

1. Calculate the percentage increase:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual temperature} - \text{Set temperature}}{\text{Set temperature}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = 0.04 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = 4\% \]

2. Now, we need to find the set temperature that will result in an actual temperature of 520 degrees, given that the oven is off by 4%.

Let \( x \) be the set temperature. The actual temperature is 4% higher than the set temperature:
\[ \text{Actual temperature} = x + 0.04x \]
\[ \text{Actual temperature} = 1.04x \]

We want the actual temperature to be 520 degrees:
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

3. Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans \( G \) is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. We can express these relationships mathematically as:

\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:

\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Thus, the number of more green jelly beans than red jelly beans is:

"To determine how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work and then figure out how much more he needs to pay after his deposit.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the dental work:**
   - Each implant has a base price of $2000.
   - George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is:
     \[
     2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - One of the implants will have a porcelain crown, which costs an extra $500.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is:
     \[
     4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Subtract the deposit from the total cost:**
   - George has already paid a deposit of $600.
   - The remaining amount he needs to pay is:
     \[
     4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine how many hours George needs to work to earn the remaining amount:**
   - George earns $15 per hour.
   - The number of hours he needs to work to earn $3900 is:
     \[
     \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours to have enough money to pay for the dental work.

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, the other two angles are \( 2x \) and \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

The largest angle is \( 3x \):
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

3. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth 5 cents. Colby has 14 nickels.
   \[
   14 \times 5 = 70 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth 1 cent. Colby has 15 pennies.
   \[
   15 \times 1 = 15 \text{ cents}
   \]

Next, we sum up all the amounts:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed of the plane is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ 120 \, \text{pounds} / 2 \, \text{hours} = 60 \, \text{pounds/hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \, \text{pounds} = 90 \, \text{pounds/hour} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates each can make in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

\[ 60 \, \text{pounds/hour} \times 12 \, \text{hours} = 720 \, \text{pounds} \]

For Marissa:

\[ 90 \, \text{pounds/hour} \times 12 \, \text{hours} = 1080 \, \text{pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts made by Ruiz and Marissa to find the total:

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade, we need to calculate his earnings for each period and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the earnings for the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- The total number of cups sold in four hours is \( 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups} \).
- The total earnings for the first four hours is \( 60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30 \).

Next, let's calculate the earnings for the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- The total number of cups sold in two hours is \( 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups} \).
- The total earnings for the next two hours is \( 20 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12 \).

Now, we sum the earnings from both periods:
- Total earnings = Earnings from the first four hours + Earnings from the next two hours
- Total earnings = \$30 + \$12 = \$42

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of \$42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb per second to kb per hour.
2. Convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour.

First, we calculate the speed in kb per hour:
- There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in an hour.
- Ashley's speed is 20 kb per second, so in one hour, she can download \(20 \times 3600 = 72000\) kb.

Next, we convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour:
- Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we divide the total kb by 1000 to get the speed in Mb.
- \(72000 \div 1000 = 72\) Mb per hour.

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:

"To find the total number of cars towed by the truck in the week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first three days and the remaining four days.

1. For the first three days, the truck towed 10 cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
   \[
   10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
   \]

2. For the remaining four days, the truck towed four fewer cars each day compared to the first three days. So, the number of cars towed each day for the remaining four days is:
   \[
   10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day}
   \]
   Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
   \[
   6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}
   \]

3. Adding the totals from both parts of the week gives us the total number of cars towed for the entire week:
   \[
   30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars}
   \]

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the required height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 4 feet is:
   \[
   4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. Determine the difference in height between Adam's current height and the required height:
   \[
   48 \text{ inches} - 40 \text{ inches} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Adam grows 2 inches per year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow the additional 8 inches, we divide the height difference by his annual growth rate:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Determine the total cost of acquiring the cars.
3. Calculate the profit from selling the cars.
4. Calculate James's commission based on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.**

James sold 10 cars, each costing $25,000.
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between them. 

First, we find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, and Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. 

Next, we need to find out how long it will take Tom to close the 75-mile gap at this rate. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if he misses some classes. The total cost of the classes is $60, and there are 10 total classes.

First, we calculate the cost per class if Manny attends all 10 classes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\$60}{10 \text{ classes}} = \$6 \text{ per class} \]

Since the cost per class is $6 when he attends all classes, which is less than $10, we need to find out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. Then, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class when he misses \( x \) classes is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\$60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum \( x \) such that:
\[ \frac{\$60}{10 - x} \leq \$10 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10. If he misses 5 or more classes, the cost per class will be more than $10, and his parents won't sign him up again.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in a week.

1. **Determine Jewel's daily production:**
   - Jewel processes 50 customers per day.

2. **Determine Julie's daily production:**
   - Julie processes customers twice as fast as Jewel.
   - Therefore, Julie processes \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) customers per day.

3. **Calculate the total daily production for both:**
   - Total daily production = Jewel's daily production + Julie's daily production
   - Total daily production = 50 + 100 = 150 customers per day

4. **Calculate the total weekly production:**
   - They work 7 days a week.
   - Total weekly production = Total daily production \(\times\) 7
   - Total weekly production = 150 \(\times\) 7 = 1050 customers

The total weekly production for the two is 1050 customers.

   \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs}
   \]

3. Convert the number of whole eggs to dozens:
   There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozens}
   \]

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day.

First, we calculate the total number of days required to read the book:
\[ \text{Total pages} = 200 \]
\[ \text{Pages per day} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Total days required} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200}{10} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Next, we determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish:
\[ \text{Deadline} = 30 \text{ days} \]
\[ \text{Days before the deadline} = \text{Deadline} - \text{Total days required} = 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ days} \]

Thus, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

"To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for the hanger and fuel over 12 months.

1. **Initial cost of the plane:**
   \[
   \text{Initial cost} = \$150,000
   \]

2. **Monthly cost to rent a hanger:**
   \[
   \text{Hanger cost per month} = \$5,000
   \]

3. **Monthly cost for fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Fuel cost per month} = 2 \times \text{Hanger cost per month} = 2 \times \$5,000 = \$10,000
   \]

4. **Total monthly maintenance cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total monthly cost} = \text{Hanger cost per month} + \text{Fuel cost per month} = \$5,000 + \$10,000 = \$15,000
   \]

5. **Total maintenance cost for the first year:**
   \[
   \text{Total maintenance cost for 12 months} = 12 \times \text{Total monthly cost} = 12 \times \$15,000 = \$180,000
   \]

6. **Total cost for the first year:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Initial cost} + \text{Total maintenance cost for 12 months} = \$150,000 + \$180,000 = \$330,000
   \]

Thus, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is:
\[
\boxed{330000}

"To solve the problem, let's break down the information given:

1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. Therefore, the cooking time for pork is:
   \[
   30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is:
   \[
   30 + 50 = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Therefore, the cooking time for beans is:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now, to find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:
\[
30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total cooking time for all the food is:
\[

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

"To determine the total cost of Roger's purchases, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee.
2. Determine the total amount of coffee Roger needs for a week.
3. Calculate the total cost of the coffee.
4. Add the cost of the donut to the total cost of the coffee.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee.
The normal brand costs $5 per pound. The more expensive brand costs 20% more.
20% of $5 is \( 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \) dollar.
So, the more expensive brand costs \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) dollars per pound.

Step 2: Determine the total amount of coffee Roger needs for a week.
Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, so for a week (7 days), he needs \( 1 \times 7 = 7 \) pounds of coffee.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the coffee.
The cost of 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is \( 7 \times 6 = 42 \) dollars.

Step 4: Add the cost of the donut to the total cost of the coffee.
The donut costs $2, so the total cost is \( 42 + 2 = 44 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost of everything is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Days in the Month**: 30 days.
2. **Good Days in the First 30 Days**: 12 days.
3. **Bad Days in the First 30 Days**: 8 days.
4. **Neutral Days in the First 30 Days**: The rest of the days, which is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

Next, we need to consider the distribution of these days over the first 24 days:
- **First 8 Days**: All good.
- **Next 8 Days**: All bad.
- **Next 8 Days**: All neutral.

Now, we need to account for the next three days:
- The next three days are good, neutral, and good.

So, let's update the count of good days:
- Initially, there were 12 good days.
- Adding the next three days: 1 good, 1 neutral, 1 good.

Thus, the total number of good days after these three days is:
\[ 12 + 1 + 1 = 14 \]

Since the month has 30 days, and we have already accounted for 27 days (24 initial days + 3 additional days), we need to determine how many good days are left in the remaining 3 days of the month.

The remaining 3 days are:
- 30 - 27 = 3 days.

Since the problem does not specify the moods for these remaining 3 days, we assume they are not good days (as no additional information is provided).

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[ 14 - 14 = 0 \]

However, since the remaining days are not specified, we assume they are not good days, so the number of good days left is:
\[ 14 - 14 = 0 \]

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[ 0 \]

Final answer:

"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:
\[ J = 2S + 3 \]

We are given that Janey has 21 books, so:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find \( S \), we first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. James buys 8 more toys to have enough for the 12 dogs, so he now has 4 + 8 = 12 toys.
4. When James returns, there are twice as many dogs as when he left. Initially, there were 12 dogs, so now there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
5. James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys to have enough for the 24 dogs, so he now has 12 + 12 = 24 toys.
6. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so there are 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.
7. James no longer needs 3 toys, so he now has 24 - 3 = 21 toys.

Therefore, James needs 21 toys in total.

"Let's denote the number of cookies each person has with the following variables:
- \( K \) for Katarina
- \( M \) for Max
- \( C \) for Cookie Monster
- \( S \) for Summer

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max: \( K = M - 5 \)
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster: \( M = C + 12 \)
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max: \( S = M + 23 \)
4. Katarina has 68 cookies: \( K = 68 \)

First, we can substitute \( K = 68 \) into the first equation to find \( M \):
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]
\[ M = 68 + 5 \]
\[ M = 73 \]

Next, we use the value of \( M \) to find \( C \):
\[ M = C + 12 \]
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

Then, we use the value of \( M \) to find \( S \):
\[ S = M + 23 \]
\[ S = 73 + 23 \]
\[ S = 96 \]

Now, we have the number of cookies each person has:
- Katarina: 68
- Max: 73
- Cookie Monster: 61
- Summer: 96

To find the total number of cookies, we add these values together:

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( L \).

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the new length of the dress before adding the lace trim is \( L + 0.5L = 1.5L \).

She then adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom, making the final length of the dress:
\[ 1.5L + 20 \]

We know the final length of the dress is 140 cm, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( L \), we first subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ L = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Converting 3 hours into minutes:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the time before dinner to find out how many minutes John has to nap:

180 minutes (before dinner) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap.

"First, let's determine the cost of the candies. We know the total cost of five lollipops and four candies is $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so the total cost for the lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

Subtracting the cost of the lollipops from the total cost gives us the cost of the four candies:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost for 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost for 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

"To determine the total number of coins Rong and Neil have saved after ten years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of coins Rong saves per month.
2. Calculate the number of coins Neil saves per month.
3. Determine the total number of months in ten years.
4. Calculate the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over ten years.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of coins Rong saves per month.**
Rong saves 20 coins every month.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of coins Neil saves per month.**
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. This means Neil saves:
\[ 20 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \right) = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

**Step 3: Determine the total number of months in ten years.**
There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over ten years.**
Rong's total savings over ten years:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

The combined total savings of Rong and Neil:
\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

Thus, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:
\[ 5760 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, let's denote the total bill as \( T \). The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill:
\[ \text{Heartworm check} = 0.60T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60T \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

"To find the total number of squares on Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to determine the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The problem states there are 14 red squares.
   - Number of red squares = 14

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The problem states there are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The problem states there are 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - The problem states there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter in square feet is equal to the total number of squares.

"To determine how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to calculate the total number of chairs required for the function and then compare it to the number of chairs currently available at the restaurant.

1. **Calculate the total number of chairs needed:**
   - There are 42 adults and 15 babies.
   - Each adult will need a regular chair.
   - Each baby will need a high chair.

   Total chairs needed = Number of regular chairs needed + Number of high chairs needed
   Total chairs needed = 42 (for adults) + 15 (for babies)
   Total chairs needed = 57

2. **Determine the number of chairs currently available:**
   - The restaurant has 8 high chairs.
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
   - Number of regular chairs = 5 * Number of high chairs
   - Number of regular chairs = 5 * 8
   - Number of regular chairs = 40

   Total chairs available = Number of regular chairs + Number of high chairs
   Total chairs available = 40 + 8
   Total chairs available = 48

3. **Calculate the number of additional chairs needed:**
   - Additional chairs needed = Total chairs needed - Total chairs available
   - Additional chairs needed = 57 - 48
   - Additional chairs needed = 9

Therefore, Mia needs to get 9 more chairs.

"First, let's determine the number of points each student has collected.

1. Adam has collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
   - 30% of 50 points is \( 0.30 \times 50 = 15 \) points.
   - Therefore, Betty has \( 50 + 15 = 65 \) points.
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   - Therefore, Tom has \( 65 - 30 = 35 \) points.
4. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   - Therefore, Martha has \( 3 \times 35 = 105 \) points.

Next, let's calculate the total number of points collected by the class:
- Adam: 50 points
- Betty: 65 points
- Tom: 35 points
- Martha: 105 points

Total points = \( 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 \) points.

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. Therefore, the class is missing:

"To determine the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the time she dances with her arms at her sides and the time she dances with her arms raised.

1. **Time with arms at her sides:**
   - Helga dances for 5 minutes in total.
   - She raises her arms for 2 minutes.
   - Therefore, she dances with her arms at her sides for \(5 - 2 = 3\) minutes.

2. **Tapping rates with arms at her sides:**
   - Right foot: 300 taps per minute.
   - Left foot: 250 taps per minute.

3. **Total taps with arms at her sides:**
   - Right foot: \(300 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 900 \text{ taps}\).
   - Left foot: \(250 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ taps}\).
   - Combined total for 3 minutes: \(900 + 750 = 1650 \text{ taps}\).

4. **Tapping rates with arms raised:**
   - Both feet: 200 taps per minute each.

5. **Total taps with arms raised:**
   - Right foot: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\).
   - Left foot: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\).
   - Combined total for 2 minutes: \(400 + 400 = 800 \text{ taps}\).

6. **Combined total number of taps:**
   - Total taps with arms at her sides: 1650 taps.
   - Total taps with arms raised: 800 taps.
   - Combined total: \(1650 + 800 = 2450 \text{ taps}\).

Thus, the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person ate and then subtract that from the total number of slices available.

1. **Total number of slices available:**
   - Each pizza has 12 slices.
   - There are 5 pizzas (one for each person).
   - Total slices = 5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.

2. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends:**
   - Bryce and two friends each ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
   - Slices eaten by each of these three people = 2/3 * 12 slices = 8 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by Bryce and two friends = 3 people * 8 slices/person = 24 slices.

3. **Slices eaten by the remaining two friends:**
   - The remaining two friends each ate 3/4 of their pizzas.
   - Slices eaten by each of these two people = 3/4 * 12 slices = 9 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by the remaining two friends = 2 people * 9 slices/person = 18 slices.

4. **Total slices eaten:**
   - Total slices eaten = 24 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (remaining two friends) = 42 slices.

5. **Slices left:**
   - Total slices left = Total slices available - Total slices eaten = 60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices.

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is 18.

"First, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

8 feet and 4 inches is equivalent to:
\[ 8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let \( B \) represent the length of Bobby's shoe in inches. We can set up the equation:
\[ 100 = 9B + 10 \]

To find \( B \), we solve for \( B \):
\[ 100 - 10 = 9B \]
\[ 90 = 9B \]
\[ B = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ B = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is 10 inches.

"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars.

First, calculate the number of students' cars whose windows were smashed:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of these cars' windows.
- Number of students' cars with smashed windows = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \) cars.

Each student's car has 4 windows, so the total number of windows smashed in the students' cars is:
- \( 16 \times 4 = 64 \) windows.

Next, calculate the number of teachers' cars whose windows were smashed:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Hannah smashes 3/4ths of these cars' windows.
- Number of teachers' cars with smashed windows = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24 \) cars.

Each teacher's car has 2 windows, so the total number of windows smashed in the teachers' cars is:
- \( 24 \times 2 = 48 \) windows.

Finally, add the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars to get the total number of windows smashed:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (students' windows) + 48 (teachers' windows) = 112 windows.

"To find out how much each roommate, including Jenna, will pay per year for electricity, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total annual electricity cost.
2. Divide the total annual cost by the number of roommates to find the individual share.

First, the total annual electricity cost:
- Monthly electricity bill: $100
- Number of months in a year: 12
- Total annual cost = $100 * 12 = $1200

Next, divide the total annual cost by the number of roommates:
- Number of roommates, including Jenna: 4 + 1 = 5
- Individual share = $1200 / 5 = $240

So, each roommate will pay $240 per year for electricity.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glasses and plates initially sent.
2. Subtract the number of broken items from the total number of items sent.

First, convert the dozens to individual items:
- 8 dozen glasses = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
- 4 dozen plates = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

Next, subtract the broken items:
- Broken glasses = 10
- Broken plates = 6

So, the remaining items are:
- Remaining glasses = 96 - 10 = 86 glasses
- Remaining plates = 48 - 6 = 42 plates

Finally, add the remaining glasses and plates to get the total number of items Jeff has now:
- Total remaining items = 86 + 42 = 128

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps of Lorraine's trades and calculate the total number of buttons she ends up with.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Small stickers: 30
   - Large stickers: 40

2. **Trading 90% of small stickers for large buttons:**
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 27 small buttons = 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons

3. **Remaining small stickers:**
   - 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers

4. **Trading 50% of large stickers for large buttons:**
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons

5. **Remaining large stickers:**
   - 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers

6. **Trading the remaining large stickers for small buttons:**
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons

7. **Total small buttons after all trades:**
   - Remaining small stickers: 3
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60
   - Total small buttons = 3 + 60 = 63 small buttons

8. **Total large buttons:**
   - From trading small stickers: 9
   - From trading large stickers: 20
   - Total large buttons = 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons

9. **Total buttons:**
   - Total small buttons: 63
   - Total large buttons: 29
   - Total buttons = 63 + 29 = 92

Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is 92.

"Let's denote the number of votes in favor of the new regulation as \( F \) and the number of votes against it as \( A \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, which can be expressed as:
\[ F = 2A \]

The total number of people on the council is 33, so the total number of votes is also 33. This can be expressed as:
\[ F + A = 33 \]

We can substitute \( F = 2A \) into the second equation:
\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now, substituting \( A = 11 \) back into the equation \( F = 2A \):
\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To find out how many shirts Krissa needs to order, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS):** 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S):** Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.
   \[
   \text{Number of small shirts} = 2 \times 11 = 22
   \]
3. **Medium (M):** Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   \[
   \text{Number of medium shirts} = 22 - 4 = 18

4. **Large (L):** Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   \[
   \text{Number of large shirts} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
   \]
5. **Extra-large (XL):** Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   \[
   \text{Number of extra-large shirts} = 9 + 6 = 15

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the Llesis family traveled, which includes both the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

1. **Calculate the driving distance:**
   - They drove for a total of 6 hours, but since they hiked for 1.5 hours, they drove for \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
   - Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour.
   - The driving distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Driving distance} = \text{Driving speed} \times \text{Driving time} = 50 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4.5 \, \text{hours} = 225 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the hiking distance:**
   - Their hiking speed was 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed is:
     \[
     \frac{50 \, \text{miles/hour}}{2} = 25 \, \text{miles/hour}
     \]
   - Therefore, their hiking speed is:
     \[
     25 \, \text{miles/hour} - 5 \, \text{miles/hour} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour}
     \]
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours, so the hiking distance is:
     \[
     \text{Hiking distance} = \text{Hiking speed} \times \text{Hiking time} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \text{Driving distance} + \text{Hiking distance} = 225 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 255 \, \text{miles}

2. **Ava's Scores:**
   - Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
   - Ava collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
   - Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so she has \( T - 4 \) seconds left on the timer.

3. **Calculate Emma's Score:**
   - Points from enemies: \( 10E \)
   - Points from berries: \( 5B \)
   - Points from timer: \( 30T \)
   - Total score for Emma: \( 10E + 5B + 30T \)

4. **Calculate Ava's Score:**
   - Points from enemies: \( 10(E + 8) = 10E + 80 \)
   - Points from berries: \( 5(B + 3) = 5B + 15 \)
   - Points from timer: \( 30(T - 4) = 30T - 120 \)
   - Total score for Ava: \( 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \)

5. **Find the Difference in Scores:**
   - Emma's score: \( 10E + 5B + 30T \)
   - Ava's score: \( 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \)
   - Difference: \( (10E + 5B + 30T) - (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) = 25 \)

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

He bought 17 more fish from the pet store. Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of orange fish he bought
- \( y \) as the number of white fish he bought

We know that:
\[ x + y = 17 \]

First, expand the equation:
\[ 3 + x = 8 + 2y \]

Rearrange to isolate \( x \):
\[ x - 2y = 5 \]

We also have the equation:
\[ x + y = 17 \]

Now, we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( x - 2y = 5 \)
2. \( x + y = 17 \)

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From the second equation, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 17 - y \]

Substitute \( x = 17 - y \) into the first equation:
\[ 17 - y - 2y = 5 \]
\[ 17 - 3y = 5 \]
\[ -3y = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3y = -12 \]
\[ y = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify, substitute \( y = 4 \) back into the equation \( x + y = 17 \):
\[ x + 4 = 17 \]
\[ x = 13 \]

Now, check the condition:
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \)
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \)

Indeed, 16 is twice 8, so the solution is correct.

The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has.

Bubbles has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

The total number of stuffed animals she currently has is:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be:
\[ 14 + x \]

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

   - Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.
   - In 4 hours (240 minutes), Jack can play:
     \[
     \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters}
     \]

2. **Two Friends (Worse Players):**
   - Each of these friends can play for 10 minutes with 1 quarter (half as long as Jack).
   - In 4 hours (240 minutes), each of these friends can play:
     \[
     \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters}
     \]
   - Since there are two such friends, the total quarters used by both is:
     \[
     24 \text{ quarters/friend} \times 2 \text{ friends} = 48 \text{ quarters}
     \]

3. **One Friend (Better Player):**
   - This friend can play for 30 minutes with 1 quarter (1.5 times as long as Jack).
   - In 4 hours (240 minutes), this friend can play:
     \[
     \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters}
     \]

4. **Total Quarters Used:**
   - Adding up all the quarters used by Jack and his friends:
     \[
     12 \text{ quarters (Jack)} + 48 \text{ quarters (two worse friends)} + 8 \text{ quarters (better friend)} = 68 \text{ quarters}
     \]

5. **Total Money Spent:**
   - Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total money spent is:
     \[
     68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars}
     \]

The total amount of money used is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so \( s = 2z \).

We know the total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total volume as:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2z + 2s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

Since \( s = 2z \), substitute \( s \) in the equation:
\[ 2z + 4(2z) = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 8z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, substitute \( z = 1 \) back to find \( s \):
\[ s = 2z = 2(1) = 2 \]

Finally, the amount of oil is:
\[ 2s = 2(2) = 4 \]

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. The number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of cars Joe has left after selling and giving away cars:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, Joe remains with 16 cars.

"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount raised by the students. The total amount raised for the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250.

"To find the total time Sandy took to walk over the two days in minutes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the time Sandy walked on the second day.
2. Add the time from both days.
3. Convert the total time from hours to minutes.

First, we know that Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day:
\[ \text{Time on the second day} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we add the time from both days:
\[ \text{Total time in hours} = 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we convert the total time from hours to minutes:
\[ \text{Total time in minutes} = 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[ 720 \]"

"To find out how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply by 7.

1. First, calculate the total number of tasks John completes in one day:
   - John does 30 cycles a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 tasks.
   - Total tasks per day = 30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day.

2. Next, calculate John's daily earnings:
   - Each task pays $1.20.
   - Daily earnings = 150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day.

3. Finally, calculate John's weekly earnings:
   - John works 7 days a week.
   - Weekly earnings = $180/day * 7 days/week = $1260/week.

"To find out how many total points Sasha scored during both games, we need to break down the information given:

1. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.
3. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

Now, we add the points Sasha scored in both games:
- First game: 14 points
- Second game: 4 points

Total points scored by Sasha: \(14 + 4 = 18\)

"To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we need to calculate the total number of tins for each type of food and then find the difference.

First, calculate the total number of tins of cat food:
\[ 8 \text{ packages} \times 11 \text{ tins per package} = 88 \text{ tins} \]

Next, calculate the total number of tins of dog food:
\[ 6 \text{ packages} \times 6 \text{ tins per package} = 36 \text{ tins} \]

Now, find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food:
\[ 88 \text{ tins} - 36 \text{ tins} = 52 \text{ tins} \]

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards.

"To find out how many eggs Cindy had altogether, let's break down the information given:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. So, the number of blue eggs is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
3. She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs. So, the number of pink eggs is \(10 - 1 = 9\).
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. So, the number of yellow eggs is \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\).

Now, we add up all the eggs:
- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs = \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\)

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and the amount of money she will get refunded from Amazon.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
     \[
     \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40
     \]
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
     \[
     \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60
     \]
   - Total shipping cost:
     \[
     \text{Total shipping cost} = \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
     \[
     \text{Refund amount} = \$32 \times 0.75 = \$24
     \]

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - Milly initially paid $32 for the book.
   - She will receive a refund of $24.
   - She will also pay $3 for shipping.
     \[
     \text{Net loss} = \$32 - \$24 + \$3 = \$11

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then use that to find out how long it will take the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( v \) (distance per hour).
   - Since 3 kangaroos are traveling together, their combined speed is \( 3v \).
   - They take 18 hours to travel across the highway, so the total distance \( D \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3v \times 18
     \]
     \[
     D = 54v
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).
   - Four turtles traveling together have a combined speed of:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for the turtles to travel the same distance:**
   - The distance \( D \) is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles, which is \( 54v \).
   - The time \( T \) it takes for the turtles to travel this distance is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\text{combined speed of turtles}} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take four turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after all contributions and then subtract the cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in reduces the price by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( P \).

The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her job earnings, and her mom's contribution:
\[ P + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the reduced price of the laptop:
\[ P + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ P + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( P \):
\[ P = 350 - 230 \]
\[ P = 120 \]

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first calculate the total amount of milk currently produced by the 3 cows.

Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day. Therefore, 3 cows produce:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional amount of milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows required to produce 10 liters of milk a day is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

1. We know that 5 students are good at math only.
2. We also know that 8 students perform well in English only.
3. The total number of students in the class is 20.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English:
- Total students = Students good at math only + Students good at English only + Students good at both
- 20 = 5 + 8 + Students good at both
- 20 = 13 + Students good at both
- Students good at both = 20 - 13
- Students good at both = 7

Now, we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both:
- Students good at math = Students good at math only + Students good at both
- Students good at math = 5 + 7
- Students good at math = 12

Therefore, the number of students who are good at math is 12.

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we first need to calculate the total time available for performances, including the intermission.

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we subtract the 10-minute intermission from the total time:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total time required for each group to perform, including the time to get on stage, perform, and exit the stage:
\[ 2 \text{ minutes (on stage)} + 6 \text{ minutes (performance)} + 2 \text{ minutes (exit)} = 10 \text{ minutes/group} \]

To find out how many groups can perform, we divide the total available time by the time required per group:
\[ \frac{110 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/group}} = 11 \text{ groups} \]

Thus, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the original principal.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = P \times r \times t \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate,
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

Given:
- \( P = 300 \) dollars,
- \( r = \frac{3}{4} \) of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year,
- \( t = 3 \) years.

First, calculate the total interest earned over 3 years:
\[ \text{Total Interest} = 225 \times 3 = 675 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, add the total interest to the original principal to find the total amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{Total Interest} = 300 + 675 = 975 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ 975 \]"

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- My age: \( x \)
- My brother's age: \( x + 3 \)
- My sister's age: \( x - 2 \)
- My mom's age: \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \)

According to the problem, the sum of all our ages is 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 9 - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87 \]

\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

"To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we first need to determine how many glasses each of the boys sold. 

1. Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold a total of 32 glasses.
2. Julie sold 14 glasses.
3. The boys (Micah and Mitchell) together sold \(32 - 14 = 18\) glasses.
4. Since the boys sold an equal number of glasses, each boy sold \(18 \div 2 = 9\) glasses.

Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:
- Julie sold 14 glasses.
- Micah sold 9 glasses.
- The difference is \(14 - 9 = 5\).

So, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Kelly is buying:

- The total cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10, so each pack of bacon costs \( \frac{10}{5} = $2 \).
- Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet of chicken costs \( 2 \times 2 = $4 \).
- Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
- Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack of apples costs \( \frac{4}{2} = $2 \).

Next, let's calculate the total cost for each type of item:

- The total cost for 6 packets of chicken is \( 6 \times 4 = $24 \).
- The total cost for 3 packs of strawberries is \( 3 \times 4 = $12 \).
- The total cost for 7 packs of apples is \( 7 \times 2 = $14 \).

Now, let's add up all the costs:

"To find the speed at which a whirligig spins, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of a thingamabob.
2. Use the speed of a thingamabob to find the speed of a whirligig.

First, we know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a thingamabob can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whirligig is:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters per second} = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

Thus, the speed of a whirligig is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the payments for mowing lawns:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn.
   - Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.

2. **Calculate the payments for mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns:**
   - Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - Tasha mowed Alba's lawn 5 times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

3. **Determine the total payment for mowing lawns:**
   - Joe's payment: \( 6J \) dollars.
   - Kamala's payment: \( 6 \times 3J = 18J \) dollars.
   - Alba's payment: \( 6 \times 5J = 30J \) dollars.
   - Total payment for mowing lawns: \( 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \) dollars.

4. **Set up the equation for total earnings:**
   - Tasha's total earnings from all activities last month were $80.
   - Let \( L \) be the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales.
   - Therefore, \( L + 54J = 80 \).

5. **Determine the value of \( J \):**
   - Since Joe paid Tasha $6, and this is the only information given about the payment per mowing, we can assume \( J = 1 \) (Tasha mowed Joe's lawn once).
   - If \( J = 1 \), then the total payment for mowing lawns is \( 54 \times 1 = 54 \) dollars.

6. **Calculate the amount made from lemonade sales:**
   - \( L + 54 = 80 \)
   - \( L = 80 - 54 \)
   - \( L = 26 \)

Therefore, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

- Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
- There are 20 red balloons.

First, we can write the equation for the total number of pieces of bologna thrown:
\[ 2r + 3y = 58 \]

We are given that \( r = 20 \). Substituting this value into the equation:
\[ 2(20) + 3y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3y = 58 \]

Next, we solve for \( y \):
\[ 3y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3y = 18 \]
\[ y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is:
\[ 6 \]"
"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs in a 30-day month, we first calculate the total number of miles Jon drives in that month.

Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 1000-mile intervals are in 3000 miles, since the car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Thus, Jon's car needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"To find out how many hours Bruce works in total over the three days, we need to calculate the hours worked each day and then sum them up.

1. **Tuesday**: Bruce works for 5 hours.
2. **Wednesday**: Bruce works twice the time he worked on Tuesday. Therefore, he works \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
3. **Thursday**: Bruce works 2 hours less than he worked on Wednesday. Therefore, he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, we sum the hours worked over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days is:

"To find out how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they both contributed equally.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons.
   - Number of sets of 2 balloons in 12 balloons: \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \)
   - Total cost for 12 balloons: \( 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \) dollars
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - Total cost for 2 tubs: \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) dollars

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ 11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \]

The total amount spent is $28. Since this amount was contributed equally by Julia and Nadine, we divide the total by 2 to find out how much each received from their mother:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"First, we determine the amount of water Anthony and his father fill into the tank, which is half the amount of water in the pool. The pool has 10000 gallons, so the tank is filled with:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of water used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so in 6 days, the amount of water used is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank after 6 days, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank:

3. Multiply the calories of a mini cinnamon roll by the number of mini cinnamon rolls.
4. Multiply the calories of a mini blueberry muffin by the number of mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

First, we calculate the calories in a mini cinnamon roll:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- Calories in a mini cinnamon roll = 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

Next, we calculate the calories in a mini blueberry muffin:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- Calories in a mini blueberry muffin = 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we calculate the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls:
- Number of mini cinnamon rolls = 200.
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls = 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

Next, we calculate the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins:
- Number of mini blueberry muffins = 300.
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins = 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and John as \( P \), \( A \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( P + A + J = 100 \) (The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old)
2. \( A = J + 10 \) (Paul is 10 years older than John)
3. \( P = A + J \) (Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

First, substitute \( A \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (J + 10) + J \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( P \) from the second and third equations into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now, find \( A \) and \( P \):
\[ A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

Thus, the age of Peter is:

3. Calculate the earnings from the carrots:
   - Jen has 4 carrots.
   - Each carrot can be sold for $1.25.
   - Total earnings from carrots = 4 carrots * $1.25/carrot = $5.

4. Sum up the earnings from all the crops:
   - Total earnings = Earnings from yams + Earnings from sweet potatoes + Earnings from carrots
   - Total earnings = $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

Therefore, Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time James spends swimming the initial distance:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 12 \) miles / \( 2 \) miles per hour = 6 hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   - Rest time = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \) hours = 3 hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   - Total distance = 20 miles.
   - Distance already swum = 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance = \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed.
   - New speed = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \) miles per hour = 1 mile per hour.

6. **Calculate the time to swim the remaining distance:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 8 \) miles / \( 1 \) mile per hour = 8 hours.

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   - Total time = Initial swimming time + Rest time + Remaining swimming time
   - Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

Thus, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:

"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we start by determining the number of loaves Sam had last Friday, which is given as 70. 

The problem states that the bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had. First, we calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had:

\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Next, we subtract 40 from this total to find the number of loaves the bakery has:

\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

"To find Leo's age, we first need to determine Marcus's age. We know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, and Deanna is 26 years old.

Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus's age = 26 - 5
Marcus's age = 21

Next, we know that Marcus is half of Leo’s age. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find Leo's age:

Marcus's age = 1/2 * Leo's age
21 = 1/2 * Leo's age
Leo's age = 21 * 2
Leo's age = 42

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To determine the number of pages in the book, we start by understanding the given information:

1. The book is 1.5 inches thick.
2. There are 100 pages per inch of paper.

First, we calculate the total number of pages per inch:
\[ 100 \text{ pages/inch} \]

Next, we find the total number of pages in 1.5 inches:
\[ 100 \text{ pages/inch} \times 1.5 \text{ inches} = 150 \text{ pages} \]

Since each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, each sheet contains 2 pages. Therefore, the total number of sheets of paper is:
\[ \frac{150 \text{ pages}}{2 \text{ pages/sheet}} = 75 \text{ sheets} \]

However, the question asks for the total number of pages, which we have already calculated as 150 pages.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many reports Vince can staple from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Vince spends stapling.
2. Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in that total time.
3. Calculate the total number of reports stapled based on the number of 15-minute intervals.

First, calculate the total time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM:
- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Convert 15 hours into minutes:
- 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

Next, determine how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
- 900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals.

Now, calculate the total number of reports stapled:
- Vince staples 30 reports per 15-minute interval.
- 60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:

"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Total sleep time without interruptions:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - 8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

2. **Time spent sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.

3. **Time she woke up early:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.
   - Usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - 5 minutes.

4. **Total time subtracted from sleep:**
   - Time spent sleepwalking: 23 minutes.
   - Time woke up early: 5 minutes.
   - Total time subtracted = 23 + 5 = 28 minutes.

5. **Total sleep time on the bed:**
   - Total sleep time without interruptions: 480 minutes.

"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan initially has. 

Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. He has two dozen measuring cups, which is 24 cups. 

To find the number of measuring spoons:
\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan initially has:
\[ \text{Total initial utensils} = \text{Number of measuring cups} + \text{Number of measuring spoons} = 24 + 16 = 40 \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so we need to subtract these from the total number of utensils:
\[ \text{Total remaining utensils} = 40 - 6 = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and 50 patients are admitted each day:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial occupied beds to the number of patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, we calculate the number of unoccupied beds by subtracting the total occupied beds from the hospital's total capacity:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

"If Courtney reported that the audience was 48 in number but overstated this by 20%, we can find the actual number of people who attended the concert by calculating what 100% (the actual number) would be.

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people. Courtney's report of 48 people is 120% of the actual number, because she overstated by 20%.

So, we have:
\[ 1.20x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the total number of holes on the island by the end of the fourth day.
3. Use the information that the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes dug by the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes, so the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

Total holes by the end of the third day:
\[ 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \]

Next, we know that by the end of the fourth day, the total number of holes is four times the number of holes dug by the end of the first day. The number of holes dug by the end of the first day is 10. Therefore, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of holes dug on the fourth day. The total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is the sum of the holes dug by the end of the third day and the holes dug on the fourth day:
\[ 29 + x = 40 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 40 - 29 \]
\[ x = 11 \]

Thus, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Together they have caught 339 Pokemon:
   \[
   A + S + X = 339
   \]
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   X = S + 5
   \]
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught:
   \[
   S = 4A - 13
   \]

We can substitute \( X \) and \( S \) in the first equation using the second and third equations.

First, substitute \( X \) from the second equation:
\[
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 2S + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
A + 2S = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S \) from the third equation:
\[
A + 2(4A - 13) = 334
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 8A - 26 = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9A = 360
\]
Divide by 9:
\[
A = 40
\]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the third equation to find \( S \):
\[
S = 4(40) - 13

Simplify:
\[
S = 160 - 13

\[
S = 147

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of episodes and then calculate the total time spent watching all episodes.

1. Each episode is 20 minutes long.
2. The number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the number of episodes is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

Now, we calculate the total time spent watching all episodes:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Number of episodes} \times \text{Length of each episode} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode.

"To determine the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction.

1. **First leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Total distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south:
- \( 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \).

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:

"To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of brownies Greta had initially:
   - She made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies.
   - She got 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office.
   - Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies to the surprise party.

   Total brownies = 1 dozen + 1/2 dozen + 4 dozen
   Total brownies = 1 + 0.5 + 4
   Total brownies = 5.5 dozen

2. Convert the total number of brownies from dozens to individual brownies:
   1 dozen = 12 brownies
   5.5 dozen = 5.5 * 12
   5.5 dozen = 66 brownies

3. Calculate the number of brownies eaten during the party:
   - 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.
   1 1/2 dozen = 1.5 dozen
   1.5 dozen = 1.5 * 12
   1.5 dozen = 18 brownies

4. Subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies:
   Brownies left = Total brownies - Brownies eaten
   Brownies left = 66 - 18
   Brownies left = 48

Therefore, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.

"To determine how much Sunny earned over the two days, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold each day and then multiply by the respective prices.

First, let's define the number of boxes sold on each day:
- Let \( G_S \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday.
- Let \( A_S \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.
- Let \( G_U \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday.
- Let \( A_U \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday.

From the problem, we know:
- \( G_S = 10 \) (Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread on Saturday)
- \( A_S = G_S - 4 \) (Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than gingerbread on Saturday)
- \( G_U = G_S + 5 \) (Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread on Sunday than on Saturday)
- \( A_U = 15 \) (Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie on Sunday)

Now, we can calculate the number of boxes sold on each day:
- \( A_S = 10 - 4 = 6 \)
- \( G_U = 10 + 5 = 15 \)

Next, we calculate the total number of boxes sold over the two days:
- Total gingerbread sold: \( G_S + G_U = 10 + 15 = 25 \)
- Total apple pie sold: \( A_S + A_U = 6 + 15 = 21 \)

Now, we calculate the total earnings:
- Earnings from gingerbread: \( 25 \times 6 = 150 \)
- Earnings from apple pie: \( 21 \times 15 = 315 \)

Finally, we add the earnings from both products to find the total earnings:

"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use each day:
   - Pamela reapplies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
   - She is outside for 4 hours a day.
   - Therefore, she uses \( 1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ ounces/day} \).

2. Calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use over the 8 days:
   - She uses 4 ounces of sunscreen each day.
   - She is on vacation for 8 days.
   - Therefore, she will use \( 4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces} \).

3. Determine how many 8-ounce bottles she will need:
   - Each bottle contains 8 ounces.
   - She needs 32 ounces in total.
   - Therefore, she will need \( \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother, and then find the sum of these ages.

1. **Determine Emil's age when he turns 24:**
   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - In 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old.

2. **Determine Emil's dad's age when Emil turns 24:**
   - When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - Let \( D \) be the age of Emil's dad when Emil turns 24.
   - Therefore, \( 24 = \frac{D}{2} \).
   - Solving for \( D \), we get \( D = 24 \times 2 = 48 \).

3. **Determine Emil's dad's current age:**
   - Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will be 48 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Emil's dad is currently \( 48 - 5 = 43 \) years old.

4. **Determine Emil's brother's age when Emil turns 24:**
   - When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - Let \( B \) be the age of Emil's brother when Emil turns 24.
   - Therefore, \( 24 = 2B \).
   - Solving for \( B \), we get \( B = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \).

5. **Determine Emil's brother's current age:**
   - Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his brother will be 12 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Emil's brother is currently \( 12 - 5 = 7 \) years old.

6. **Calculate the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now:**
   - Emil's dad is 43 years old.
   - Emil's brother is 7 years old.
   - The sum of their ages is \( 43 + 7 = 50 \).

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 50.

"First, we calculate the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the class are football players:

20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

Next, we find out how many students are left after the football players leave:

30 students - 6 students = 24 students

Out of these remaining students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band:

25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

6 football players + 6 cheerleaders or band members = 12 students

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is 12.

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine the size of Charlie's boots.

1. Sophie's boot size is given as 5.
2. Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, so:
   \[
   \text{Charlie's boot size} = 5 \times 5 = 25
   \]

Next, we calculate the average size of the boots worn by both Charlie and Sophie:

3. The average size is calculated by adding the sizes of both pairs of boots and dividing by 2:
   \[
   \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Sophie's boot size} + \text{Charlie's boot size}}{2} = \frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]

Therefore, the average size of the shoes worn by the two is:

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot.

2. **Determine the total space each plant, including the space between plants, occupies:**
   - Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - Therefore, each plant and the space between it and the next plant together occupy 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Calculate the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - The number of plants that can fit is the total length of the flower bed divided by the space each plant and the space between it occupy: 
     \[
     \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4
     \]
   - Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number:
     \[
     44 \text{ plants}
     \]

4. **Determine how many more plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 plants.
   - The number of additional plants needed is:
     \[
     44 \text{ plants} - 17 \text{ plants} = 27 \text{ plants}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.
   - The total cost is:
     \[
     27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars per plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}

"To find out how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the total cost of the plants for one basket and then multiply that by 5.

First, calculate the cost of the petunias for one basket:
- Each petunia costs $3.00.
- Katherine wants 3 petunias per basket.
- Cost of petunias for one basket = 3 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $9.00.

Next, calculate the cost of the sweet potato vines for one basket:
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
- Katherine wants 2 sweet potato vines per basket.
- Cost of sweet potato vines for one basket = 2 vines * $2.50/vine = $5.00.

Now, add the costs of the petunias and sweet potato vines for one basket:
- Total cost for one basket = $9.00 (petunias) + $5.00 (sweet potato vines) = $14.00.

Finally, multiply the total cost for one basket by the number of baskets (5):
- Total cost for 5 baskets = 5 baskets * $14.00/basket = $70.00.

Therefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
  \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \) pounds

- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
  \( 10 \times 1.5 = 15 \) pounds

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\( 12 + 15 = 27 \) pounds

The total amount of soil available is 30 pounds. Subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total soil:
\( 30 - 27 = 3 \) pounds

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:

"To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount Jessica sets aside each month for shoes.
2. Determine the total amount set aside in a year.
3. Calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the total amount set aside.

Step 1: Calculate the monthly amount set aside for shoes.
Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes.
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

Step 2: Determine the total amount set aside in a year.
There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Step 3: Calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy.
Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so:
\[ \frac{6000}{1000} = 6 \]

Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To determine the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the process into two parts: peeling and sauteing.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To find out how long it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the rate at which she peels them:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sauteing the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To find out how long it takes to saute 90 shrimp, we first determine how many batches of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 10 minutes to saute, the total time to saute 90 shrimp is:
     \[
     \text{Time to saute 90 shrimp} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to peel and saute 90 shrimp is the sum of the time to peel and the time to saute:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature changes step by step.

1. **Initial Cooling on Low:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour on low.
   - It runs on low for 3 hours.
   - Total cooling on low: \( 2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees} \).

2. **Further Cooling on High:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour on high.
   - It runs on high for 4 hours.
   - Total cooling on high: \( 3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees} \).

3. **Total Cooling:**
   - Total cooling from both low and high settings: \( 6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees} \).

4. **Warming Up:**
   - The room warms up at 2 degrees per hour with no air conditioner running.
   - It was turned off for 2 hours.
   - Total warming: \( 2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees} \).

5. **Net Temperature Change:**
   - Net temperature change: \( 18 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees} \).

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \( 90 - 75 = 15 \) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Thus, the final answer is:

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the frequency of each type of check and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill checks**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

2. **Gas bill checks**: Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill. Similarly, for 12 months:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

3. **Church checks**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church. For 12 months:
   \[
   2 \text{ checks/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service checks**: Buford writes one check every quarter. There are 4 quarters in a year:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/quarter} \times 4 \text{ quarters/year} = 4 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks/year}
\]

Thus, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of trips the first plane makes:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips.

2. **Calculate the number of trips to Greece:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - Number of trips to Greece = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \) trips.

3. **Calculate the number of trips to France and Germany:**
   - The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany.
   - Number of remaining trips = \( 88 - 66 = 22 \) trips.
   - Since these 22 trips are split equally between France and Germany, the number of trips to France = \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \) trips.

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:

"To find the combined length of time the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum them up.

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - Combined howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the combined howl duration to minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values of \( A \) and \( L \):
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

We are also given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total watermelon is divided into slices for 6 people: 2 adults and 4 kids. Therefore, the total number of slices in terms of \( x \) is:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

The total watermelon is represented by \( 8x \). Each adult gets \( 2x \) of the watermelon. To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( x \) represent the number of chocolate bars in one box.

Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combine the terms on the left side:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

To solve for \( x \), divide both sides by 8:
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost and then the total revenue, assuming the studio is fully covering its costs and making a profit.

1. **Calculate the total cost per session:**
   - Fixed cost per session: $25
   - Variable cost per student per session: $1.50
   - Number of students: 10
   - Total variable cost per session: \( 10 \times 1.50 = 15 \) dollars
   - Total cost per session: \( 25 + 15 = 40 \) dollars

2. **Calculate the total cost per week:**
   - Number of sessions per week: 3
   - Total cost per week: \( 40 \times 3 = 120 \) dollars

3. **Calculate the total cost per month:**
   - Assuming 4 weeks in a month:
   - Total cost per month: \( 120 \times 4 = 480 \) dollars

Since the question asks for the expected earnings, and we are not given any information about the revenue (e.g., how much the studio charges per student per session), we can only calculate the total cost. If the studio is covering its costs, the earnings would be zero. However, if we assume the studio is making a profit, we would need additional information about the revenue.

Given the information provided, the total cost (which is the minimum amount the studio needs to earn to break even) is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of female porcupines.
2. Calculate the number of babies born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of babies born in a year.
4. Add the total number of babies born in a year to the initial population to find the final population.

Step 1: Determine the number of female porcupines.
The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population.
\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of babies born each month.
Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
\[ \text{Babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of babies born in a year.
There are 12 months in a year.
\[ \text{Total babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

Step 4: Add the total number of babies born in a year to the initial population to find the final population.
\[ \text{Final population} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]
\[ V = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.**

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost.**

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[ 826 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water pumped into the tank each day and then determine how much more is needed to fill the tank.

1. **Calculate the amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Wanda's first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Total first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Wanda's second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

1. **Calculate the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank before these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( x - 0.07 \times 3x = x - 0.21x = 0.79x \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( 0.79x = 28 \).
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{28}{0.79} \approx 35.44\%
     \]

2. **Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank before these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( y - 0.09 \times 5y = y - 0.45y = 0.55y \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge is 35.44%.
   - Therefore, \( 0.55y = 35.44 \).
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{35.44}{0.55} \approx 64.44\%
     \]

Thus, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 64.44%.

"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Janet needs to save for the down payment.
2. Determine Janet's total earnings per hour.
3. Calculate Janet's total earnings per week.
4. Determine how many weeks it will take for Janet to save the required amount.

**Step 1: Calculate the down payment amount.**
The car costs $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of this amount for the down payment.
\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \]

**Step 2: Determine Janet's total earnings per hour.**
Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips.
\[ \text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = 25 \]

**Step 3: Calculate Janet's total earnings per week.**
Janet works 40 hours a week.
\[ \text{Total earnings per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \]

**Step 4: Determine how many weeks it will take to save the down payment.**
\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Down payment}}{\text{Total earnings per week}} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total spent so far:
\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount is:
\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in one day.
2. Calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in one day.
3. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in the month to find the monthly total.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in one day.
- A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
- With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pounds per day.
- With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe: \( 24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36 \) pounds per day.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in one day.
- One dwarf mines 36 pounds per day.
- Forty dwarves will mine \( 40 \times 36 = 1440 \) pounds per day.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days.

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios where he does not have to turn it in and then subtract this from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability of not turning in homework due to a substitute teacher is 0.50.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If the normal teacher is present, there are two sub-scenarios:
     - **Extension for the whole class:**
       - Probability of getting an extension: 40% or 0.40
       - If the class gets an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability of not turning in homework due to a class extension is 0.50 * 0.40 = 0.20.
     - **Personal Extension:**
       - Probability of not getting a class extension: 60% or 0.60
       - If the class does not get an extension, there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment:
         - Probability of getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.20
         - So, the probability of not turning in homework due to a personal extension is 0.50 * 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.06.

3. **Total Probability of Not Turning in Homework:**
   - Sum of the probabilities of the scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
     - Substitute teacher: 0.50
     - Class extension: 0.20
     - Personal extension: 0.06
   - Total probability of not turning in homework = 0.50 + 0.20 + 0.06 = 0.76

4. **Probability of Turning in Homework:**
   - Probability of turning in homework = 1 - Probability of not turning in homework
   - Probability of turning in homework = 1 - 0.76 = 0.24

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 24%.

"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - Therefore, the number of small beans equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans is:
     \[
     150 \times 3 = 450 \text{ small beans}
     \]

Thus, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - Number of bottles = \(\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}\).

2. **Determine the time to move between bottles:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next.
   - Since he starts at the first bottle, he will move between 7 pairs of bottles (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, up to the 7th to the 8th).

3. **Calculate the total time to move between all bottles:**
   - Time to move between 7 pairs of bottles = \(7 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 35 \text{ seconds}\).

4. **Add the time to drop the candy in the first bottle:**
   - Richard starts at the first bottle, so he needs to drop the candy in the first bottle before moving to the next.
   - Time to drop the candy in the first bottle = 0 seconds (since he starts there).

5. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = Time to move between bottles + Time to drop candy in the first bottle
   - Total time = 35 seconds + 0 seconds = 35 seconds.

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 35 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Jim's college education, including the loans and the income he lost by not working, and then determine how long it will take him to earn that amount with his new, higher salary.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the loans:**
   - Jim takes $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   - Total loans = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000

2. **Calculate the income lost while in school:**
   - Jim could have earned $25,000 per year if he had not gone to college.
   - Income lost over 4 years = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000

3. **Calculate the total cost of college:**
   - Total cost = Total loans + Income lost
   - Total cost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

4. **Calculate Jim's new income after college:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - New income = 3 * $25,000 = $75,000 per year

5. **Calculate the net additional income per year after college:**
   - Net additional income = New income - Previous income
   - Net additional income = $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000 per year

6. **Determine how long it will take to earn the total cost of college:**
   - Time to earn the total cost = Total cost / Net additional income
   - Time to earn the total cost = $300,000 / $50,000 = 6 years

"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces required. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

The length of each piece of fabric:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

The width of each piece of fabric:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric required is:
\[ 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered on each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday**: They delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday.
   - One-fifth of Monday's letters: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - Adding 17 to this: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)
   - So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

3. **Wednesday**: They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice the number of Tuesday's letters: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - Adding 5 to this: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)
   - So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, we sum the letters delivered over the three days:
- Monday: 425
- Tuesday: 102
- Wednesday: 209

Total letters delivered: \( 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \)

   - 1 foot = 12 inches.
   - Therefore, 4 feet = 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

2. Add the growth to Xavier's initial height:
   - Xavier grew 3 inches.
   - Xavier's new height = 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches.

3. Cole's initial height was already given in inches:
   - Cole was 50 inches tall.

4. Add the growth to Cole's initial height:
   - Cole grew 2 inches.
   - Cole's new height = 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.

5. Calculate the difference between Cole and Xavier's new heights:
   - Difference = Cole's new height - Xavier's new height
   - Difference = 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch.

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

"To find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of emails that require a response each day.
2. Multiply the number of emails that require a response by the number of workdays in a week.

First, determine the number of emails that require a response each day:
- James receives 80 emails a day.
- 20% of these emails do not require a response, so 80% do require a response.
- 80% of 80 emails is calculated as \( 0.80 \times 80 = 64 \) emails.

Next, calculate the total number of emails he responds to in a 5-day work week:
- He responds to 64 emails each day.
- Over 5 days, he responds to \( 64 \times 5 = 320 \) emails.

Therefore, the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week is 320.

"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bananas eaten by the first monkey in a week.
2. Calculate the total number of bananas eaten by the second monkey in a week.
3. Subtract the total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys from the total number of bananas to find the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week.
4. Divide the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7 to find the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. Therefore, in a week (7 days), the first monkey eats:
   \[
   10 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ bananas}
   \]

2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day. Therefore, the second monkey eats:
   \[
   10 \text{ bananas/day} + 4 \text{ bananas/day} = 14 \text{ bananas/day}
   \]
   In a week, the second monkey eats:
   \[
   14 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ bananas}
   \]

3. The total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week is:
   \[
   70 \text{ bananas} + 98 \text{ bananas} = 168 \text{ bananas}
   \]

4. The total number of bananas Mr. Robles buys is 315. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week is:
   \[
   315 \text{ bananas} - 168 \text{ bananas} = 147 \text{ bananas}
   \]

5. To find the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7:
   \[
   \frac{147 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 21 \text{ bananas/day}
   \]

Thus, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved.

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to reach 200 toothpicks:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, the number of additional weeks required to save 80 more toothpicks is:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

   6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child:
   \[
   72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:
   \[
   74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child:
   \[
   69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches}

"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of bags sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:
   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags}
   \]

2. Calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the total weight of the triceratops in kilograms.
2. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the remaining weight is \( \frac{x}{2} \).
3. The pack of velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so the remaining weight after the velociraptors is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \).
4. The group of Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which is the remaining weight after the velociraptors. Therefore, \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 1080 kilograms.

"To determine the cost to paint the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

1. Calculate the area of the north and south walls:
   - Each wall is 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.
   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls = 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet.

2. Calculate the area of the east and west walls:
   - Each wall is 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.
   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls = 2 * 40 square feet = 80 square feet.

3. Calculate the total area of all four walls:
   - Total area = 160 square feet (north and south) + 80 square feet (east and west) = 240 square feet.

4. Determine the number of gallons of paint needed:
   - One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.
   - Number of gallons needed = Total area / Coverage per gallon = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.

5. Calculate the total cost of the paint:
   - Cost per gallon = $12.
   - Total cost = Number of gallons * Cost per gallon = 12 gallons * $12 = $144.

The total cost to paint the room is $144.

"To determine how many people Billy helps, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy takes off.
3. Calculate the number of days Billy works.
4. Calculate the total number of people he helps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.

Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy takes off.**

Billy takes 20% of the days off.

Number of days off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

**Step 3: Calculate the number of days Billy works.**

Number of days Billy works = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of people he helps.**

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day.

People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day

Total people helped = Number of days worked * People helped per day = 40 days * 6 people/day = 240 people

"First, we determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times the distance Amber ran, we calculate:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8 miles
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Next, we calculate the total distance run by Amber and Micah:

Total distance by Amber and Micah = Amber's distance + Micah's distance
Total distance by Amber and Micah = 8 miles + 28 miles
Total distance by Amber and Micah = 36 miles

Now, we find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance run by all three:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - Total distance by Amber and Micah
Ahito's distance = 52 miles - 36 miles
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work to save for her retirement, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save and how much she can save each year.

1. **Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs for retirement:**
   - Lauren wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - Current annual salary = $100,000.
   - Annual retirement income needed = 40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000.

2. **Calculate the total amount needed for 20 years of retirement:**
   - Total retirement savings needed = Annual retirement income needed * Number of years in retirement.
   - Total retirement savings needed = $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

3. **Calculate the amount Lauren saves each year:**
   - Lauren saves 20% of her annual salary.
   - Annual savings = 20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000.

4. **Determine the number of years needed to save the total amount:**
   - Number of years needed = Total retirement savings needed / Annual savings.
   - Number of years needed = $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement.

"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs, we first need to determine the weights of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory’s dog.

Kory’s dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah’s first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah’s second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weights of all the dogs together:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( S \) be the number of stickers Seth had initially.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris. The remaining stickers are \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \).
5. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, Kris had \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers.
6. Since Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we set up the equation: \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = 16 \times 4 \]
\[ S = 64 \]

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

"First, we need to calculate the total number of M&M's John has. Each large bag weighs 10 ounces, and there are 3 large bags, so the total weight is:

\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 30 M&M's per ounce, the total number of M&M's is:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&M's per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&M's} \]

John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, so the number of small bags he can make is:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&M's}}{10 \text{ M&M's per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted 56 eggs in total.
2. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.
3. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.
4. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

First, let's find out how many eggs Sarah and Camden each painted. Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted. Then Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs. According to the problem, the total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah is 30:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

Next, we need to find out how many eggs Arnold and Madeline painted. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, let \( A \) be the number of eggs each of them painted. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56:
\[ A + A + 9 + 21 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.

Finally, we need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

2. Calculate the number of boxes needed.
3. Calculate the total weight of the crayons.
4. Calculate the total weight of the boxes.
5. Add the total weight of the crayons and the boxes.
6. Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds.

Step 1: Determine the number of groups of 8 crayons.
\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of boxes needed.
Since each group of 8 crayons goes into one box, the number of boxes is equal to the number of groups.
\[ \text{Number of boxes} = 25 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the crayons.
\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Step 4: Calculate the total weight of the boxes.
\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Step 5: Add the total weight of the crayons and the boxes.

"To solve the problem, let's first determine how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.

Let \( x \) be the number of marbles Bob currently has. According to the problem:
\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, the number of marbles he will have is:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug.
- The temperature of the water in the first mug is 33 degrees.
- Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of \( T_2 \)-degree water.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) of the mixture is given by the weighted average of the temperatures of the two waters:

\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{4 + 1} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:

\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{5} \geq 40 \]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):

\[ 4 \times 33 = 132 \]

Now, substitute this into the inequality:

\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T_2 \):

\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is 68 degrees.

1. Jim collected 27 seashells.
2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos.
3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey.

First, we find out how many seashells Carlos collected:
\[ \text{Carlos's seashells} = \text{Jim's seashells} - 5 = 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we determine how many seashells Carrey collected:
\[ \text{Carrey's seashells} = \frac{\text{Carlos's seashells}}{2} = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of seashells collected by all three:
\[ \text{Total seashells} = \text{Jim's seashells} + \text{Carlos's seashells} + \text{Carrey's seashells} = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

Finally, we divide the total number of seashells equally among the three:
\[ \text{Seashells per person} = \frac{\text{Total seashells}}{3} = \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Each person gets 20 seashells.

"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total for the weekdays and the weekend separately and then add them together.

- On weekdays (Monday to Friday), Mason eats 4 carrots each day. There are 5 weekdays, so:
  \( 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \)

- On the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), Mason eats 5 carrots each day. There are 2 weekend days, so:
  \( 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \)

Adding the totals for weekdays and weekends gives:
\( 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \)

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots a week.

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would need to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people:**
   - Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand.
   - Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, 5 bottles are needed (since 100% / 20% = 5 bottles).

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:**
   - Total bottles needed = 2300 people * 5 bottles/person = 11500 bottles.

3. **Determine the current production capacity:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.

4. **Calculate the additional number of bottles needed:**
   - Additional bottles needed = Total bottles needed - Current production capacity
   - Additional bottles needed = 11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles.

Therefore, Hortex would need to produce 7300 more bottles to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \), the length of the red rope as \( R \), and the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation.

From \( B = Y - 7 \), we can express \( R \) as:
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28 \]

Now substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides:
\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, find \( B \) using \( B = Y - 7 \):
\[ B = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

Finally, find \( R \) using \( R = 4B \):
\[ R = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Amount Given to Their Little Sister:**
   - Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \(x\) dollars, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Calculate \(\frac{4}{5} \times 15\):
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
     \]
   - So, the equation becomes:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3

"To find out how much Mr. Marcellus got in refunds, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased.
2. Determine the amount of milk that was returned.
3. Calculate the refund amount based on the returned milk.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased.
Total cost = Number of gallons * Cost per gallon
Total cost = 4000 gallons * $3.5/gallon
Total cost = $14,000

Step 2: Determine the amount of milk that was returned.
Amount of milk returned = Total amount of milk * Fraction that was sour
Amount of milk returned = 4000 gallons * 2/5
Amount of milk returned = 1600 gallons

Step 3: Calculate the refund amount.
Refund amount = Amount of milk returned * Cost per gallon
Refund amount = 1600 gallons * $3.5/gallon
Refund amount = $5,600

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus got $5,600 in refunds.

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, expand the first equation:
\[
W = 5C + 35
\]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]

Distribute the 3 on the left side:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[
75 = 2C + 35
\]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[
40 = 2C
\]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20
\]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to calculate the total number of books he can buy with $27000. 

1. Calculate the cost per book:
   \[
   \text{Cost per book} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000:
   \[
   \text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \text{ books}
   \]

3. Since Bob distributes the books equally among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3:
   \[
   \text{Number of books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books}
   \]

Thus, Bob can buy 1800 books per school.

"Let's break down the sequence of events to determine how many apples Newton brought home:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up both apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other one into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall.
3. Now, there are 1 (from the first throw) + 5 (from the second throw) = 6 apples on the ground.
4. Newton picked up these 6 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree, causing another 6 apples to fall.
5. Now, there are 1 (from the previous throw) + 6 (from the third throw) = 7 apples on the ground.
6. Newton picked up all 7 apples and went home.

Now, let's count the total number of apples Newton put in his pocket:
- 1 apple from the first two that fell.
- 5 apples from the second batch that fell.
- 6 apples from the third batch that fell.

Total apples in Newton's pocket: 1 + 5 + 6 = 12

Therefore, Newton brought home 12 apples.

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices of each type of pizza her friends will consume and then convert that into the number of whole pizzas.

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends:
- Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices.
- There are 6 friends.

Total cheese pizza slices consumed:
\[ 6 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends:
- Each friend eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices.
- There are 6 friends.

Total pepperoni pizza slices consumed:
\[ 4 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we need to determine how many whole pizzas are required for each type of pizza.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- Total cheese pizza slices needed: 36 slices.

Number of cheese pizzas needed:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- Total pepperoni pizza slices needed: 24 slices.

Number of pepperoni pizzas needed:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Finally, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas to find the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the rate at which he makes the snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of making snowballs:**
   - Jay can make 20 snowballs in one hour.
   - Therefore, in 15 minutes (which is 1/4 of an hour), he can make \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) snowballs.

2. **Rate of melting snowballs:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.

3. **Net rate of snowball accumulation:**
   - In 15 minutes, Jay makes 5 snowballs and 2 melt, so the net increase in snowballs is \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) snowballs every 15 minutes.

4. **Total time to reach 60 snowballs:**
   - To find out how many 15-minute intervals are needed to reach 60 snowballs, we divide 60 by the net increase per 15 minutes:
     \[
     \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ intervals}
     \]
   - Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time required is:
     \[
     20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of John and Jim at the time Digimon came out and then use that information to find Jim's current age.

1. **Determine the year Digimon came out:**
   - Digimon had its 20th anniversary, so it came out 20 years ago.
   - If the current year is 2023, then Digimon came out in 2023 - 20 = 2003.

2. **Determine John's age when Digimon came out:**
   - John is 28 years old now (in 2023).
   - Therefore, in 2003, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out:**
   - When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - If John was 8 years old, then Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

4. **Determine Jim's current age:**
   - Since 20 years have passed since 2003, Jim's current age is 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

Therefore, Jim is 24 years old now.

"To determine how many bandages the nurses' station started with on the first day, we need to track the usage and orders over the three days and then work backwards.

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bandages they started with on the first day.
   - At the end of the first day, they had \( x - 38 + 50 \) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \( 38 - 10 = 28 \) bandages.
   - They did not order any bandages on the second day.
   - At the end of the second day, they had \( (x - 38 + 50) - 28 \) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they received \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) bandages.
   - At the end of the third day, they had \( ((x - 38 + 50) - 28 + 100) - 25 \) bandages.

We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
((x - 38 + 50) - 28 + 100) - 25 = 78
\]

Simplify the equation step by step:

\[
(x + 12) - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78
\]

\[
x + 12 - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78
\]

\[
x + 59 = 78
\]

Subtract 59 from both sides:

\[
x = 19
\]

Thus, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is:

\[
\boxed{19}

"To determine the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color separately, and then add them together.

1. **Cost of the color**: The cost for the color is a flat rate of $40.
2. **Cost of the haircut**: The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch of hair cut off. May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the length of hair cut off is:
   \[
   10 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 2 \text{ inches}
   \]
   The cost for the haircut is:
   \[
   2 \text{ inches} \times 30 \text{ dollars per inch} = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total cost**: The total cost is the sum of the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut:

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
Let \( b \) be the number of brownies Carly makes.

From the problem, we know:
1. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.
   \[
   b = 3c - 2
   \]

2. Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats.
   \[
   \text{Total treats} = 5 \times 2 = 10
   \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and brownies:
\[
c + b = 10
\]

Now, substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
c + (3c - 2) = 10
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
4c - 2 = 10
\]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought. 

Rose bought five dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40. 

Total cost = 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs Rose has. 

Total number of eggs = 5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs

Now, let's calculate how much Rose will sell the eggs for. She sells the eggs at a rate of $1 for 3 eggs.

Total revenue = (60 eggs / 3 eggs) * $1 = 20 * $1 = $20.00

Finally, let's calculate Rose's profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00

"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many marbles Dallas originally had before dropping any.
2. Subtract the number of marbles Dallas originally had from the total number of marbles Mazie had to find out how many Mazie gave to Darla.

First, we know that Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4. Therefore, before dropping any, Dallas had:
\[ 21 + 4 = 25 \text{ marbles} \]

Mazie originally had 52 marbles. If she gave 25 marbles to Dallas, the number of marbles she gave to Darla is:
\[ 52 - 25 = 27 \]

"To determine the force John needs to push the car, we first need to calculate the total weight of the car, including the luggage and the children.

1. Weight of the car: 1200 pounds
2. Weight of the luggage: 250 pounds
3. Weight of the two children: 75 pounds each, so 75 * 2 = 150 pounds

Now, add these weights together to get the total weight:
1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

The force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds:
1% of 1600 = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

Therefore, the force John needs to push the car is 16 pounds.

"First, let's determine how much each person raised:

- Alexandra raised $430.
- Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
- Sarah raised $300.
- Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up the amounts raised by all four girls:

- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Sarah: $300
- Maryam: $700

Total amount raised = $430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $2180

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race. Let's break down the information given:

1. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
2. Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran 2 miles.
3. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.
4. Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.

First, we calculate Aaron's speed:
- Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes.
- Therefore, Aaron's time per mile is \( \frac{16 \text{ minutes}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 8 \text{ minutes per mile} \).

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's time per mile is:
- \( 8 \text{ minutes per mile} \times 2 = 16 \text{ minutes per mile} \).

Now, we calculate the total time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:
- \( 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.

\[ \text{Total line required} = 3 \times 200 = 600 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we subtract the 6 feet of new line he already has from the total required:

\[ \text{Line to buy} = 600 - 6 = 594 \text{ feet} \]

"To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from one reservation.
2. Calculate the total revenue from all reservations in one night.
3. Calculate the total revenue for the week, considering the restaurant is open 2 days a week.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from one reservation.**

Each reservation includes:
- 2 meals at $5 each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars
- 1 bottle of wine at $5: \(5\) dollars

Total revenue per reservation: \(10 + 5 = 15\) dollars

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from all reservations in one night.**

The restaurant gets 6 reservations a night:
- Total revenue per night: \(6 \times 15 = 90\) dollars

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue for the week.**

The restaurant is open 2 days a week:
- Total revenue per week: \(90 \times 2 = 180\) dollars

Thus, the total revenue for the week is:

"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we first need to calculate the total selling price of all the watermelons and then divide that by the number of watermelons.

1. Calculate the total cost price of the watermelons:
   \[
   \text{Total cost price} = \$80
   \]

2. Calculate the total profit:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 25\% \text{ of } \$80 = 0.25 \times 80 = \$20
   \]

3. Calculate the total selling price:
   \[
   \text{Total selling price} = \text{Total cost price} + \text{Profit} = \$80 + \$20 = \$100
   \]

4. Calculate the selling price per watermelon:
   \[
   \text{Selling price per watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total selling price}}{\text{Number of watermelons}} = \frac{100}{50} = \$2
   \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dora's current age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - Therefore, Dora is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **Determine James's current age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora.
   - Therefore, James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **Determine John's current age:**
   - John had James when he was 19.
   - Therefore, John is currently \(18 + 19 = 37\) years old.

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - Therefore, the youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Determine the youngest son's age in 3 years:**
   - In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in 60 minutes and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in 60 minutes:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes per orange.
   - In 60 minutes, the number of oranges Ana can peel is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in 60 minutes:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes per orange.
   - In 60 minutes, the number of oranges Jane can peel is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

3. **Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:**
   - The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original price is $400, and he gets it for 80% off.

The discount amount is:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, the cost of the radiator after the discount is:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens.
2. Let \( k \) represent the number of cows.

We know the following:
- The total number of animals is 20.
- The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can write the equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Next, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( c \):
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.

"To determine how many slices each person can have, we first need to calculate the total number of pizza slices. Since each of the 7 pizzas is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people (Henry and his 3 friends, making a total of 4 people):

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Thus, each person can have 14 slices.
