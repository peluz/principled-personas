"To determine the total number of bolts needed for a robe, we need to add the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber.

A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. Half of 2 bolts is 1 bolt. Therefore, the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber.

2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts in total.

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to calculate the final value of the house after the repairs and then subtract the total cost (purchase price plus repair costs) from this value.

The value of the house increased by 150% due to the repairs. This means the value of the house after repairs is 250% of the original value (100% original value + 150% increase).

First, we calculate the 250% of the original value of the house:
250% of $80,000 = 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000

This is the new value of the house after the repairs. Now, we need to calculate the total cost Josh incurred:
Total cost = Purchase price + Repair costs
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
Profit = New value of the house - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

So, Josh's profit is $70,000.

"James runs 3 sprints each session, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. To find the total meters he runs a week, we can multiply the number of sprints per session by the distance of each sprint and then multiply that by the number of sessions per week.

So, the calculation is:

3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint * 3 sessions/week

Now, let's do the math:

3 * 60 * 3 = 540 meters/week

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to calculate the total amount of feed required for the day and then subtract the amount already given in the morning and afternoon meals.

Each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily requirement is:
20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups

Wendi has already given:
15 cups in the morning + 25 cups in the afternoon = 40 cups

The remaining amount of feed needed for the final meal is:
60 cups (total daily requirement) - 40 cups (already given) = 20 cups

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To calculate the total cost for 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: every first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

We can pair the glasses into sets of two, with each set costing $5 (for the first glass) + $3 (for the second glass) = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide 16 by 2 to find the number of pairs, which is 8 pairs.

Now, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair to find the total cost:
8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, to find the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together, we add the number of sheep in each city:

Seattle's sheep + Charleston's sheep + Toulouse's sheep = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file, including the time lost due to the Windows update.

1. First, we calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file:
   40% of 200 GB is 0.40 * 200 GB = 80 GB.

2. Since Carla downloads at a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is:
   80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

3. After the download is interrupted, Carla has to wait for the Windows update, which takes 20 minutes.

4. After the update, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. The time to download the full 200 GB file is:
   200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

5. The total time is the sum of the time to download 40% of the file, the time for the update, and the time to download the full file again:
   40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes for Carla to download the file is 160 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance John traveled away from home and then subtract the distance he traveled back towards home.

First, we calculate the distance John traveled away from home:
- John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
- Distance = Speed * Time
- Distance away = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles

Next, we calculate the distance John traveled back towards home:
- He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles.
- He then drives for half an hour at 30 mph.
- Distance back (first part) = 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles
- He then drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (4 hours total - 2 hours in traffic - 0.5 hours at 30 mph) at 80 mph.
- Distance back (second part) = 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles

Total distance back towards home:
- Total distance back = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles

Finally, we calculate how far John is from home:
- Distance from home = Distance away - Distance back
- Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles

John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider both her regular pay for the first 40 hours and her overtime pay for the additional hours she worked.

Regular pay for the first 40 hours:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

Overtime pay for the additional 5 hours:
5 hours * ($10/hour * 1.2) = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings for the week:
$400 (regular pay) + $60 (overtime pay) = $460

"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, which is:
3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads was reduced by 30% from the second month's downloads. The reduction in downloads is:
30% of 180 = 0.30 * 180 = 54 downloads.

So, the number of downloads in the third month is:
180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

The total number of downloads over the three months is the sum of the downloads in each month:
60 (first month) + 180 (second month) + 126 (third month) = 366 downloads.

"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum them up.

For the donuts:
3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen would be 3 * $68.

For the mini cupcakes:
2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen would be 2 * $80.

For the mini cheesecakes:
6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen would be 6 * $55.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

Donuts: 3 * $68 = $204
Mini cupcakes: 2 * $80 = $160
Mini cheesecakes: 6 * $55 = $330

Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330

Total cost = $694

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and then see how many years it will take for the cumulative net profit to cover the initial planting cost.

The annual income from selling lemons is:
7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5

The annual cost for watering and feeding the tree is:
$3

The net profit per year is:
$10.5 (income) - $3 (cost) = $7.5

The initial cost to plant the tree is:
$90

To find out how many years it will take to cover the initial cost, we divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:
$90 / $7.5 per year = 12 years

However, after 12 years, the profit will just cover the cost, so he will start earning money in the 13th year.

"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there.
2. She then sold 2 more to the red house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} + 2 \) vacuum cleaners in total so far.
3. After the red house, she had \( x - \left( \frac{x}{3} + 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( x - \left( \frac{x}{3} + 2 \right) \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house.
5. After the orange house, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left, so the remaining vacuum cleaners after the orange house sale is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( x - \left( \frac{x}{3} + 2 \right) \right) = 5 \).

Let's solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( x - \left( \frac{x}{3} + 2 \right) \right) = 5
\]

\[
x - \left( \frac{x}{3} + 2 \right) = 10
\]

\[
x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 = 10
\]

\[
\frac{3x}{3} - \frac{x}{3} = 12
\]

\[
\frac{2x}{3} = 12
\]

\[
2x = 36
\]

\[
x = 18
\]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance.
2. Subtract the number of contemporary dance students from the total to find the remaining students.
3. Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students.
4. Subtract the number of jazz dance students from the remaining students to find the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
5. Calculate the percentage of the entire class that is enrolled in hip-hop dance.

Let's do the calculations:

1. 20% of 20 students are enrolled in contemporary dance:
   \( 20 \times \frac{20}{100} = 4 \) students

2. Subtract the 4 contemporary dance students from the total:
   \( 20 - 4 = 16 \) students remaining

3. 25% of the remaining 16 students are enrolled in jazz dance:
   \( 16 \times \frac{25}{100} = 4 \) students

4. Subtract the 4 jazz dance students from the remaining students to find the number of hip-hop dance students:
   \( 16 - 4 = 12 \) students

5. Calculate the percentage of the entire class that is enrolled in hip-hop dance:
   \( \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\% \)

So, the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%.

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her weekly earnings from both jobs and then multiply by the number of weeks she works in a year.

First, we calculate her weekly earnings from teaching:
$20 per hour * 35 hours per week = $700 per week

Next, we calculate her weekly earnings from cheerleading coaching:
$30 per hour * 15 hours per week = $450 per week

Now, we add the two weekly earnings to find her total weekly income:
$700 per week + $450 per week = $1150 per week

Finally, we multiply her total weekly income by the number of weeks she works in a year to find her annual salary:
$1150 per week * 50 weeks per year = $57,500 per year

Jill's annual salary is $57,500.

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs Claire uses per day: 3 eggs.
2. Calculate the total number of eggs Claire uses per week: 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.
3. Calculate the total number of eggs Claire uses in 4 weeks: 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.
4. Convert the total number of eggs to dozens: 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Marissa should take to hike the 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.
2. Calculate the time Marissa has already spent hiking.
3. Determine the remaining time she has to complete the trail.
4. Calculate the speed required to cover the remaining distance in the remaining time.

Step 1: Total time to hike 12 miles at 4 miles per hour:
Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Step 2: Time already spent hiking:
Time for first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time for next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent = 1 hour + 1 hour
Total time spent = 2 hours

Step 3: Remaining time to complete the trail:
Remaining time = Total time - Time already spent
Remaining time = 3 hours - 2 hours
Remaining time = 1 hour

Step 4: Distance remaining to be hiked:
Distance remaining = Total distance - Distance already hiked
Distance remaining = 12 miles - (4 miles + 2 miles)
Distance remaining = 12 miles - 6 miles
Distance remaining = 6 miles

Speed required for the remaining distance:
Speed required = Distance remaining / Remaining time
Speed required = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed required = 6 miles per hour

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire trail.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in both the orange drink and the pineapple drink, and then sum them up after accounting for the spill.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink before the spill:

- The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in it is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 \) liters.

Now, let's calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:

- The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in it is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 \) liters.

Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, we need to subtract the water content of that 1 liter from the total water content of the orange drink:

- The amount of water in 1 liter of the orange drink is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 1 \) liter.

Now, let's do the calculations:

Water in 10 liters of orange drink before spill: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters
Water in 1 liter of spilled orange drink: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 1 = \frac{2}{3} \) liters
Water in 9 liters of remaining orange drink: \( \frac{20}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) liters

Water in 15 liters of pineapple drink: \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) liters

Total water in the 24 liters of mixed drink: \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) liters

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 15 liters.

"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Calculate the age of Raymond when his son was born.
3. Subtract the age Raymond was when his son was born from his current age to find out how many years ago his son was born.

Step 1: Determine Raymond's current age.
Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before her, Raymond is 31 + 6 = 37 years old.

Step 2: Calculate the age of Raymond when his son was born.
Raymond had his son at the age of 23.

Step 3: Subtract the age Raymond was when his son was born from his current age.
Raymond is currently 37 years old, and he was 23 when his son was born, so 37 - 23 = 14 years ago.

Raymond's son was born 14 years ago."

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up the equation based on the information that Kyle paid 75% (100% - 25% discount) of the original price. Let's denote the original price as \( P \).

The equation is:
\[ 0.75 \times P = 19.50 \]

To solve for \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now we calculate the value of \( P \):
\[ P = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to calculate the total cost of the other items she bought and subtract that from the total amount she paid. Then we divide the remaining amount by the cost of one box of pizza.

The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50, so the amount spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is $17 / $8.50 = 2.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Now, we solve for \( B \):

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the boots cost 104 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given ratio and the total age of Darrell and Allen.

Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162, so we can write the equation as:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18}\]
\[x = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find Allen's current age by multiplying \(11x\):
\[11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's age 10 years from now will be:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

"To find the average guess, we need to first determine what each friend guessed and then sum those guesses and divide by the number of guesses.

The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.

The second friend guessed 20 more than half the first one's guess:
Half of the first guess is 80 / 2 = 40.
20 more than that is 40 + 20 = 60.

The third friend guessed 25% more than the first one's guess:
25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20.
25% more than 80 is 80 + 20 = 100.

Now we sum the guesses:
80 (first guess) + 60 (second guess) + 100 (third guess) = 240.

To find the average, we divide the sum by the number of guesses, which is 3:
240 / 3 = 80.

The average guess is 80.

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two equations:

1. The total number of coins is 110:
   \( S + G = 110 \)

2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins:
   \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( S \):

\( S + (S + 30) = 110 \)
\( 2S + 30 = 110 \)
\( 2S = 110 - 30 \)
\( 2S = 80 \)
\( S = 40 \)

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:

\( G = S + 30 \)
\( G = 40 + 30 \)
\( G = 70 \)

Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels and then add 5 to find out how many jewels Aaron has:
   Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20
   Aaron's jewels = 20 + 5 = 25
3. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has to find out how many jewels Siobhan has:

"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scored in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add that to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.

So in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 points + 1 point = 5 points.

To find the total points, we add the points from the first 20 minutes to the points from the second 20 minutes:

4 points + 5 points = 9 points.

First, let's find out how many hours he runs on the other two days:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs for 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours he runs in a week:
- Total hours = 3 (first day) + 1.5 (second day) + 1.5 (third day)
- Total hours = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5
- Total hours = 6

Now we can calculate his average speed:
- Average speed = Total distance / Total time
- Average speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
- Average speed = 10 miles per hour

So, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

10 mph"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds, and then calculate the distance she can travel in six hours given the time spent running and walking.

First, we know that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, which is half as fast as she can run. Therefore, her running speed is twice her skipping speed:

Running speed = 2 * Skipping speed
Running speed = 2 * 3 mph
Running speed = 6 mph

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we can determine her walking speed:

Walking speed = Running speed / 4
Walking speed = 6 mph / 4
Walking speed = 1.5 mph

Now, we need to calculate the time spent running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking over a total of six hours:

Time spent running = 1/3 * 6 hours
Time spent running = 2 hours

Time spent walking = 2/3 * 6 hours
Time spent walking = 4 hours

Next, we calculate the distance traveled while running and walking:

Distance running = Running speed * Time spent running
Distance running = 6 mph * 2 hours
Distance running = 12 miles

Distance walking = Walking speed * Time spent walking
Distance walking = 1.5 mph * 4 hours
Distance walking = 6 miles

Finally, we add the distances together to get the total distance traveled:

Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking
Total distance = 12 miles + 6 miles
Total distance = 18 miles

"When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than her normal throwing distance. Her normal throwing distance is 400 feet, so with the gemstone, she can throw the javelin:

400 feet * 3 = 1200 feet

The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside of the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's flame reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone:

1200 feet - 1000 feet = 200 feet

Polly can stand 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips.
2. Calculate the number of calories per gram of chips.
3. Determine how many calories you have left to consume for the day.
4. Calculate how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories.

Step 1: Total calories in the 300g bag
Since there are 5 servings in the bag and each serving has 250 calories, the total number of calories in the bag is:
5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories

Step 2: Calories per gram of chips
The bag is 300g, so the number of calories per gram is:
1250 calories / 300g = 4.1667 calories/gram

Step 3: Remaining calories for the day
You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories, so the remaining calories are:
2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories

Step 4: Grams of chips you can eat
To find out how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per gram:
200 calories / 4.1667 calories/gram ≈ 47.999 grams

Since you can't eat a fraction of a gram, we'll round down to the nearest whole gram.

47 grams
(Note: The actual value is closer to 48 grams, but we round down to be safe and not exceed the calorie limit.)"
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total cost of making the candles and the total revenue from selling them.

First, we need to find out how many pounds of beeswax are required to make 20 candles. Since 1 pound of beeswax can make 10 candles, we can calculate the pounds of beeswax needed as follows:

20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds of beeswax

Next, we calculate the total cost of the beeswax and wicks for 2 pounds:

2 pounds * $10.00 per pound = $20.00

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:

20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00

Finally, we calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

$40.00 (revenue) - $20.00 (cost) = $20.00 (net profit)

"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to determine the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the average time it takes to write one article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is:
5 articles * 2/5 = 2 articles more than Monday.

So, the total number of articles on Tuesday is:
5 articles + 2 articles = 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is:
7 articles * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, we can calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
5 articles (Monday) + 7 articles (Tuesday) + 14 articles (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to calculate the total number of Post-it notes she used and then subtract the number she originally had in her purse from that total.

Candice placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee, so she used 220 Post-it notes at work. She had 23 Post-it notes remaining after placing them on the cups. This means that the total number of Post-it notes she had before placing them on the cups is the sum of the Post-it notes she used and the Post-it notes she had left over:

220 (used) + 23 (remaining) = 243 (total she had before placing them on the cups)

Candice originally had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is the difference between the total she had before placing them on the cups and the number she originally had:

243 (total she had) - 80 (originally had) = 163 (in the package)

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased is:

163"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find out how many blue ties he bought, we divide the total amount spent by the cost per tie:
   Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
   Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
   Number of blue ties = 5

2. John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. So, the number of red ties is:
   Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
   Number of red ties = 2 * 5
   Number of red ties = 10

3. The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. The cost of a blue tie is $40, so the cost of a red tie is:
   Cost of red tie = Cost of blue tie + (50% of Cost of blue tie)
   Cost of red tie = $40 + (0.5 * $40)
   Cost of red tie = $40 + $20
   Cost of red tie = $60

4. To find out how much John spent on red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost per red tie:
   Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of red tie
   Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60
   Total spent on red ties = $600

5. To find out the total amount John spent on all ties, we add the amount spent on blue ties to the amount spent on red ties:
   Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
   Total spent on ties = $200 + $600
   Total spent on ties = $800

So, the total amount John spent on ties is $800.

"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Step 1: Total number of units in the building
Total units = Number of floors * Units per floor
Total units = 15 floors * 8 units/floor
Total units = 120 units

Step 2: Number of occupied units
Occupied units = Total units * Occupancy rate
Occupied units = 120 units * 3/4
Occupied units = 90 units

Step 3: Number of unoccupied units
Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 120 units - 90 units
Unoccupied units = 30 units

"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
2. Calculate the daily income from selling the eggs.
3. Multiply the daily income by the number of days in a week to get the weekly income.

Step 1: Number of dozens of eggs produced per day
There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.
252 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 21 dozens per day

Step 2: Daily income from selling the eggs
Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, so we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen.
21 dozens * $2 per dozen = $42 per day

Step 3: Weekly income
There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily income by 7 to find the weekly income.
$42 per day * 7 days per week = $294 per week

Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week.

"To determine how long it takes Tom to get back, we first need to calculate the distance he travels from 1 to 4 PM.

Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour, and he sails from 1 to 4 PM, which is a total of 3 hours.

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, we know the distance he needs to travel back is 30 miles, and he travels at a rate of 6 miles per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the 30 comic books that Uriah removes:

30 comic books * 1/4 pound per comic book = 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds

Now, Uriah still needs to remove more weight to reach the total of 15 pounds. We subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to remove:

15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds

Next, we need to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove to get rid of the remaining 7.5 pounds. Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so we divide the remaining weight by the weight of one toy:

7.5 pounds / 1/2 pound per toy = 7.5 / 0.5 = 15 toys

Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit. Then, we divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box.

The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds.
The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.
The weight of each box is 15 pounds.

First, we calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after accounting for the driver and the empty truck:

5000 pounds (bridge limit) - 3755 pounds (driver and truck) = 1245 pounds (remaining capacity)

Next, we determine how many boxes can be loaded with the remaining capacity:

1245 pounds (remaining capacity) / 15 pounds (per box) = 83 boxes

Since we can't load a fraction of a box, we take the integer part of the result, which is 83.

"If Marcy works for 30 years, she will have worked 10 years beyond the 20-year mark, which is the point at which she starts to become entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.

For each year after 20 years, she earns an additional 5% of the $50,000/year pension. So for 10 years, she will earn an additional 10 * 5% = 50% of the $50,000/year pension.

50% of $50,000 is 0.50 * $50,000 = $25,000.

Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years of service will be the base pension plus the additional 50% she earned for the 10 years after the 20-year mark.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency and then use that to determine the total distance she can travel on a full tank.

First, we calculate the fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg) based on the information that she traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas:

Fuel efficiency (mpg) = Distance traveled (miles) / Amount of gas used (gallons)
Fuel efficiency (mpg) = 100 miles / 4 gallons
Fuel efficiency (mpg) = 25 mpg

Now that we know her car's fuel efficiency is 25 miles per gallon, we can calculate the total distance she can travel on a full tank of 12 gallons:

Total distance (miles) = Fuel efficiency (mpg) * Tank capacity (gallons)
Total distance (miles) = 25 mpg * 12 gallons
Total distance (miles) = 300 miles

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so:
Number of emeralds = 2 * Number of rubies
Number of emeralds = 2 * 140
Number of emeralds = 280

Now, we add the number of each type of gem to find the total number of gems:

1st level: 64 * 2 = 128 square feet

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels to find the average:

Total square footage = 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet
Number of levels = 4

Average square footage per level = Total square footage / Number of levels
Average square footage per level = 240 / 4 = 60 square feet

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in that time and then divide by the number of cups per bag.

First, we need to know how many days are in a year. A standard year has 365 days.

For the first 180 days, the puppy will consume 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of food for the first 180 days is:
180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups

For the remaining days of the year (365 - 180 = 185 days), the puppy will consume 2 cups of dog food per day. So, the total amount of food for the remaining 185 days is:
185 days * 2 cups/day = 370 cups

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total amount of dog food consumed in the first year:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Each bag of dog food contains 110 cups. To find out how many bags Cecilia will need, we divide the total cups by the number of cups per bag:
550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

"If Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and she does 4 times as much laundry as David, then David does:

400 pounds / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.

If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, then Raymond does:

400 pounds / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:

200 pounds - 100 pounds = 100 pounds.

"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying the flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 with the cost of buying them in packages of 2 for $1.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- 18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages
- 6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- 18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages
- 9 packages * $1.00 per package = $9.00

The difference in cost between the two options is:
- $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00

Therefore, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

"Two girls each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, which means each girl got:

24 liters * (1/6) = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, they got a total of:

4 liters * 2 = 8 liters

The boy then got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy is:

8 liters + 6 liters = 14 liters

The total amount of water was 24 liters, so the amount of water left is:

24 liters - 14 liters = 10 liters

"To find the combined weight of Grace and Alex, we first need to determine Alex's weight. According to the problem, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs.

Grace's weight: 125 pounds
4 times Grace's weight: 4 * 125 = 500 pounds
Alex's weight: 500 - 2 = 498 pounds

Now, we add Grace's and Alex's weights to find their combined weight.

Grace's weight + Alex's weight = 125 + 498 = 623 pounds

"Let's denote the number of games won as W and the number of games lost as L. According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so we have:

W + L = 22

It is also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us:

W = L + 8

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for L:

(L + 8) + L = 22
2L + 8 = 22
2L = 22 - 8
2L = 14
L = 14 / 2
L = 7

Now that we know the number of games lost (L), we can find the number of games won (W):

W = L + 8
W = 7 + 8
W = 15

The team won 15 games.

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to apply the 10% increase to her initial monthly salary of $600 for each of the three years following her 5-year mark.

First, let's calculate her monthly salary after the first 10% increase:
$600 + ($600 * 10%) = $600 + $60 = $660

Now, we apply the 10% increase for the second year:
$660 + ($660 * 10%) = $660 + $66 = $726

And for the third year:
$726 + ($726 * 10%) = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Now, to find her annual salary, we multiply her monthly salary after three years by 12 (months in a year):
$798.60 * 12 = $9,583.20

Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $9,583.20.

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, which we can denote as \( 10H \).

The total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald is 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find the number of copies Harald sold, we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"To find out how much Christina will spend on gift bags, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the expected number of attendees, knowing that 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up.
2. Determine the number of gift bags needed based on the expected number of attendees.
3. Calculate the total cost of the gift bags.

Step 1: Expected number of attendees
Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, 3/4 of the invited guests are expected to attend.
Expected attendees = 3/4 * 16 friends = 12 friends

Step 2: Number of gift bags needed
Christina needs .75 gift bags per attendee.
Number of gift bags = 12 friends * .75 gift bags per friend = 9 gift bags

Step 3: Total cost of the gift bags
Each gift bag costs $2.
Total cost = 9 gift bags * $2 per gift bag = $18

Therefore, Christina will spend $18 on gift bags.

"To calculate the total amount of potato salad Ted the T-Rex needs to bring to the picnic, we need to consider the amount that both adults and children will eat.

Each adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad. With 20 adults, the total amount of potato salad for the adults is:
20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs

Each child dinosaur will eat half as much as an adult, which is 5 lbs of potato salad. With 5 children, the total amount of potato salad for the children is:
5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs

Adding the amounts for adults and children together, we get the total amount of potato salad needed:
200 lbs (for adults) + 25 lbs (for children) = 225 lbs

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Gerald's original time for the 400-meter hurdles and then calculate his improved time after his diet change.

Let's denote Gerald's original time as \( G \) seconds. According to the problem, Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. Since Lee now runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, Gerald's original time would be:

\[ G = 38 + 2 \]
\[ G = 40 \] seconds

Gerald's speed improved by 10% due to his diet change. An improvement in speed by 10% means that he can now run the same distance in 90% of his original time. So, his new time \( G_{\text{new}} \) is:

\[ G_{\text{new}} = G \times 0.90 \]
\[ G_{\text{new}} = 40 \times 0.90 \]
\[ G_{\text{new}} = 36 \] seconds

So, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that the number of dogs is 60.
2. We are told that there are two cats for every dog. Therefore, the number of cats is 2 times the number of dogs.
3. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats.

Let's calculate the number of cats:
Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, let's calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:
Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

The number of rabbits is twelve less than this combined number:
Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

Finally, to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

2. Calculate the number of girls:
Since there are 200 students in total and 80 of them are boys, the number of girls is:
200 - 80 = 120 girls

3. Calculate the number of girls in the girl scout:
2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, so:
(2/3) * 120 = 80 girls in the girl scout

4. Calculate the number of girls not in the girl scout:
The number of girls not in the girl scout is the total number of girls minus the number of girls in the girl scout:

James' sleep time = 9 hours * 2/3
James' sleep time = 6 hours

Now we subtract James' sleep time from Harry's sleep time to find the difference:

Difference = Harry's sleep time - James' sleep time
Difference = 9 hours - 6 hours
Difference = 3 hours

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to work backwards from the final volume of the sauce to the initial volume of the canned tomatoes, and then determine how many tomatoes that volume represents.

1. Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce.
2. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked into sauce, the original volume of the canned tomatoes must have been twice the volume of the sauce.
3. Therefore, the original volume of the canned tomatoes is 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.
4. Each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes.
5. To find out how many cans she used, we divide the total volume of the canned tomatoes by the volume of one can: 64 ounces / 16 ounces/can = 4 cans.
6. Since each can contains three tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is 4 cans * 3 tomatoes/can = 12 tomatoes.

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, after the first 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through in the remaining 15 minutes. Additionally, 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

The total number of cars that were originally on the motorway is 30. Therefore, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the 20 cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, minus the 5 cars that took an exit.

The equation to represent this is:
\[ x + 20 - 5 = 30 - 5 \]
\[ x + 15 = 25 \]
\[ x = 25 - 15 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, 10 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"To determine how much water Julia's boat took on by the time she reached the shore, we need to calculate the total distance she rowed and then use the given rate of water intake to find the total amount of water.

First, we need to find out how far Julia rowed in 64 seconds. We know that she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. We can set up a proportion to find out how many feet she rows in 64 seconds:

20 feet / 16 seconds = X feet / 64 seconds

Solving for X:

X = (20 feet * 64 seconds) / 16 seconds
X = 1280 feet / 16
X = 80 feet

Now that we know she rowed 80 feet, we can calculate the amount of water that entered the boat. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. We can set up another proportion to find out how many liters of water entered the boat over 80 feet:

2 liters / 10 feet = Y liters / 80 feet

Solving for Y:

Y = (2 liters * 80 feet) / 10 feet
Y = 160 liters / 10
Y = 16 liters

"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to determine the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue she will make from selling it at the new increased price.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:

- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each: 10 * $10 = $100
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each: 5 * $16 = $80

Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180

Next, we calculate the selling price of each type of board after the 50% price increase:

- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards: $10 + ($10 * 50%) = $10 + $5 = $15 each
- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: $16 + ($16 * 50%) = $16 + $8 = $24 each

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the boards:

- Revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10 * $15 = $150
- Revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 * $24 = $120

Total revenue = $150 + $120 = $270

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90

The total parts of the mixture are 7 (for sugar) + 13 (for water) = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined. To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we need to calculate the fraction of the total that is sugar and then apply that fraction to the total amount used.

The fraction of the total that is sugar is 7/20. To find the amount of sugar used, we multiply this fraction by the total amount:

(7/20) * 120 = 7 * (120/20) = 7 * 6 = 42

So, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we first need to determine the total number of vehicles that were added to the port on that day. We know that initially, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, which totals to 10 vehicles. The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30.

The number of vehicles added on the second day is:
30 (total vehicles) - 10 (initial vehicles) = 20 vehicles

Since each container holds 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
20 vehicles / 5 vehicles per container = 4 containers

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.
2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
4. Add both salaries to get the total salary the two were receiving four years later.

Step 1: Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.
Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. If Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, we can set up the equation to find Lylah's salary (L):

\( 40,000 = L + 0.30L \)
\( 40,000 = 1.30L \)
\( L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \)
\( L = 30,769.23 \) (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what he was making four years ago. So, his new salary (A_new) is:

\( A_{new} = 40,000 + 0.40 \times 40,000 \)
\( A_{new} = 40,000 + 16,000 \)
\( A_{new} = 56,000 \)

Step 3: Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
Since their salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. Her new salary (L_new) is:

\( L_{new} = 30,769.23 + 0.40 \times 30,769.23 \)
\( L_{new} = 30,769.23 + 12,307.69 \)
\( L_{new} = 43,076.92 \) (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 4: Add both salaries to get the total salary the two were receiving four years later.
Total salary (T) is:

\( T = A_{new} + L_{new} \)
\( T = 56,000 + 43,076.92 \)
\( T = 99,076.92 \)

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,076.92.

2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to her.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew.
4. When setting the table, she had a total of 12 spoons.

We need to find out how many spoons were in the package that Julia bought. Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as \( x \).

The total number of spoons Julia had before setting the table is the sum of the spoons she bought and the spoons her husband bought, minus the spoons she used to sample the stew:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]
\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum up the total cost for the quantities Dillon is supposed to buy.

1. First, we find the cost of a watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, a watermelon costs:
   \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) dollars.

2. Next, we find the cost of an orange. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so:
   \( 45 - 5 = 40 \) dollars.

3. Now we calculate the total cost for each type of fruit:
   - The cost for 4 watermelons is \( 4 \times 45 = 180 \) dollars.
   - The cost for 20 peppers is \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) dollars.

"To calculate the profit the hospital makes from these visits, we need to determine the total revenue and the total cost, and then subtract the cost from the revenue.

First, let's calculate the total revenue:
- The hospital charges patients $200 per hour.
- Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, which is 24/60 = 0.4 hours.
- The revenue per patient is therefore $200 * 0.4 = $80.
- With 500 patients a day, the total revenue is $80 * 500 = $40,000.

Next, let's calculate the total cost:
- The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour.
- The cost per patient is therefore $150 * 0.4 = $60.
- With 500 patients a day, the total cost is $60 * 500 = $30,000.

Finally, we calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
- Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits per day.

- Therefore, he completed 5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions.

Since the first test had 75 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is:
75 questions - 40 questions = 35 questions.

For the second test:

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Number of semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables:

- Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) represent the number of worker bees.

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many babies as queens: \( B = 2Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the worker bees, baby bees, and queens:

\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation, we get:

\[ 2B + B + \frac{B}{2} = 700 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 3B + \frac{B}{2} = 700 \]

To solve for \( B \), we first need to combine the terms on the left side of the equation. To do this, we can find a common denominator, which is 2:

\[ \frac{6B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} = 700 \]

\[ \frac{7B}{2} = 700 \]

Now, we can solve for \( B \) by multiplying both sides by 2 and then dividing by 7:

\[ 7B = 1400 \]

\[ B = 200 \]

Now that we have the number of baby bees, we can find the number of worker bees:

\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, there are 400 worker bees in the hive.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many fries were in the pack when Dave bought it.

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
4. After the seagull and pigeons ate, a raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off 1 fry.
6. There were 5 fries left.

Let's denote the original number of fries as \( x \).

After Dave and the seagull ate, there were \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \) fries left.
After the pigeons ate, there were \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \) fries left.
The raccoon then stole two thirds of the remaining fries, so one third was left, which means \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) \) fries were left.
After the ants carried off 1 fry, there were \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 \) fries left, which we know is 5 fries.

So we have the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5 \]

Let's solve for \( x \):
\[ \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6 \]
\[ x - 30 = 18 \]
\[ x = 48 \]

So, the original number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 48.

"To find the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit, in this case, feet. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches.

First, we convert the length of the rolls and croissants from inches to feet:
- Each roll is 4 inches long, so 300 rolls will be 300 * 4 inches. To convert to feet, we divide by 12: (300 * 4) / 12 feet.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, so 120 croissants will be 120 * 6 inches. To convert to feet, we divide by 12: (120 * 6) / 12 feet.
- Each baguette is already given in feet, so 60 baguettes will be 60 * 2 feet.

- Croissants: (120 * 6) / 12 = 720 / 12 = 60 feet
- Baguettes: 60 * 2 = 120 feet

Adding these together gives us the total length:

"To calculate the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we first need to find out how many bananas are required for all the apes in one month. We then multiply that number by 2 to get the total for 2 months.

Monkeys need: 200 bananas/month
Gorillas need: 400 bananas/month
Baboons need: 100 bananas/month

Total bananas needed for all apes in one month:
200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas/month

For 2 months, the total number of bananas needed is:
700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance each person runs and then find the difference between the two distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- The football field is 100 yards long.
- Running back and forth once is 200 yards (100 yards there and 100 yards back).
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times.

Blake's total distance:
15 times * 200 yards/time = 3000 yards

Now, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth to the 40-yard line, which is 80 yards one way (from the 0-yard line to the 40-yard line and back to the 0-yard line).
- She does this 34 times.

Kelly's total distance:
34 times * 80 yards/time = 2720 yards

Now, we find the difference between the two distances to see how much farther the winner runs than the loser:
Blake's distance - Kelly's distance = 3000 yards - 2720 yards = 280 yards

The winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser.

"To find out how many fish Anakin and Locsin caught, we need to calculate the total for each of them and then add those totals together.

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which is 10 - 5 = 5 starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which is 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which is 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish

Now, let's add up the totals for each of them:

Anakin's total:
10 (starfish) + 6 (sea horses) + 3 (clownfish) = 19 fish

Locsin's total:
5 (starfish) + 3 (sea horses) + 5 (clownfish) = 13 fish

Combined total:
19 (Anakin's fish) + 13 (Locsin's fish) = 32 fish

So, the total number of fish they were able to catch is 32.

"To find the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the effect of the 20% price increase that occurs every two months over the 36-month period.

First, let's determine how many times the price will increase over 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, we divide 36 by 2:

36 months / 2 months per increase = 18 increases

Each time the price increases, it is multiplied by 1 plus the percentage increase. A 20% increase is the same as multiplying by 1.20 (100% + 20% = 120% = 1.20).

The formula to calculate the final price after n increases is:

Final Price = Original Price * (1 + Increase Rate) ^ Number of Increases

Plugging in the numbers:

Final Price = $20 * (1.20) ^ 18

Now we calculate the final price:

Final Price = $20 * (1.20) ^ 18
Final Price = $20 * 38.3376 (rounded to four decimal places)
Final Price = $766.752

Rounded to the nearest cent, the final price is $766.75.

2. The cost of one action figure is $5, and there are 3 action figures.
3. The cost of the doll is the same as 3 action figures, which would be 3 * $5.

Let's calculate the total cost:

- Total cost of red cars: 5 * $4 = $20
- Total cost of action figures: 3 * $5 = $15
- Cost of the doll: 3 * $5 = $15

Now, we add up all the costs:

$20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50

The total worth of all the toys is $50.

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the cost of hiring the accountant with the income she would lose by doing her taxes herself.

If Jackie does her taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work at $35 per hour. The total lost income would be:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

The difference in cost between doing the taxes herself (in terms of lost income) and hiring the accountant is:

$105 (lost income) - $90 (accountant's fee) = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to calculate the total number of eggs required for 15 Spanish flans and then determine how many babysitting sessions are needed to gather that many eggs.

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs, so for 15 flans, Sandra will need:
15 flans * 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs

Sandra receives 9 eggs every time she babysits, so the number of babysitting sessions required to get 45 eggs is:
45 eggs / 9 eggs/session = 5 sessions

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times.

"Let's denote Seth's current age as \( S \) and Brooke's current age as \( B \).

According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the equation:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \) and Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the equation:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now we can substitute \( S \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:
\[ S = 2B \]
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

So Seth is currently 16 years old.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants, and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the hat is given as $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so the pants cost (hat cost + jacket cost) / 2 = ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to get the total cost of the uniform:

Total cost = hat cost + jacket cost + pants cost
Total cost = $25 + $75 + $50
Total cost = $150

"To find out how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the total time for peeling and cutting all 60 potatoes.

First, we calculate the time it takes to peel all the potatoes:
60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes per potato = 90 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes to cut all the potatoes:
60 potatoes * 5 seconds per potato = 300 seconds

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert the cutting time to minutes:
300 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 5 minutes

Now, we add the peeling time and the cutting time together to get the total time:
90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to first determine how many gallons of lemonade they sold to make a $25 profit.

Let's break down the costs and revenue:
- Cost of lemons per gallon: $3
- Cost of sugar per gallon: $2
- Total cost per gallon: $3 + $2 = $5
- Revenue per glass: $0.50
- Number of glasses per gallon: 20
- Revenue per gallon: 20 glasses * $0.50/glass = $10

Now, let's calculate the profit per gallon:
- Profit per gallon: Revenue per gallon - Cost per gallon = $10 - $5 = $5

To make a $25 profit, they would need to sell:
- Number of gallons to make $25 profit: $25 / $5 per gallon = 5 gallons

Since they need 5 gallons to make a $25 profit, the amount spent on lemons would be:
- Cost of lemons for 5 gallons: 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

So, they spent $15 on lemons.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

First, we need to find out how old Mark was two years ago. Since Jan is 30 years old now, two years ago Jan was 28 years old. Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 28 / 2 = 14 years.

According to the second piece of information, two years ago Mark was 5 years older than 14, which means Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old two years ago.

Now, to find out how old Mark is now, we add 2 years to his age from two years ago: 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

Finally, since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
P(>3) = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the product of the probabilities of each event:

P(even, even) = P(even) * P(even) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25

Now, we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We can do this by dividing the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 by the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row and then converting the result to a percentage:

Likelihood ratio = P(>3) / P(even, even) = 0.5 / 0.25 = 2

This means that it is 2 times more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we subtract 1 (to find the increase) and then multiply by 100:

Percentage increase = (2 - 1) * 100% = 1 * 100% = 100%

So, it is 100% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To find out how many rats are in each cage, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats, hamsters, and rabbits, and then use the information to determine the number of rats.

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters and rabbits:

- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of pieces of straw for the hamsters is 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces.
- There is a pen of rabbits with 20 pieces of straw distributed among them.

Now, let's add the straw given to the hamsters and rabbits:

50 pieces (hamsters) + 20 pieces (rabbits) = 70 pieces

Since 160 pieces of straw have been distributed in total, we can find out how many pieces were given to the rats by subtracting the straw given to the hamsters and rabbits from the total:

160 pieces (total) - 70 pieces (hamsters and rabbits) = 90 pieces (rats)

We know that each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, and the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups. To find out how many rats are in each cage, we divide the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats by the number of pieces each rat receives and then by the number of cages:

90 pieces (rats) / 6 pieces/rat = 15 rats
15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats/cage

So, there are 5 rats in each cage.

"To find out how many bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue, and then use the profit to find the number of bags.

Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

The cost of buying the bags is \( 20x \) dollars (since each bag costs $20).
The cost of transporting the bags is \( 2x \) dollars (since it costs $2 to transport each bag).

So, the total cost for the trader is:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 20x + 2x = 22x \]

The revenue from selling the bags is \( 30x \) dollars (since each bag is sold for $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, and we know the profit is $400:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 400 = 30x - 22x \]
\[ 400 = 8x \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags.

Now, we add up all the costs:
Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66
Total cost = $102

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of trees Tom has after 10 years, taking into account the trees he plants and chops down each year, and then apply the 30% die-off rate.

1. Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, resulting in a net increase of 8 trees per year.
3. After 10 years, the total number of trees will be the initial number plus the net increase over 10 years.

Let's calculate the number of trees after 10 years:

Initial number of trees: 50
Net increase per year: 10 (planted) - 2 (chopped) = 8 trees
Total increase over 10 years: 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees

Total number of trees after 10 years: 50 (initial) + 80 (increase) = 130 trees

Now, 30% of the trees die after 10 years:

30% of 130 trees = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees

The number of trees that remain after 30% die:

130 trees - 39 trees = 91 trees

So, Tom has 91 trees left.

3. On Sunday morning, the neighbors add another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the yard. This means there are now 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos and still 6 white flamingos.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos there are than white plastic flamingos by noon on Sunday, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos:

30 (pink) - 6 (white) = 24

"To find the cost of 8 pens, we first need to determine the cost of one pen. We know that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined.

The cost of a pencil is $1.20 and the cost of an eraser is $0.30. So, the cost of one pen is:

Cost of one pen = Cost of one pencil + Cost of one eraser
Cost of one pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of one pen = $1.50

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of one pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months, which is 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, to find the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has, we add the initial number of cards to the cards collected in each of the three months:

20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate the total earnings from both publishers.

Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B each week.

Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, Mark earns:
500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Adding the earnings from both publishers, we get:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

Therefore, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

"To calculate how much money John made in the year after winning the award, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the increased salary due to the 5% raise.

1. Calculate the annual salary before the raise:
   Weekly salary before raise: $2000
   Number of weeks in a year: 52
   Annual salary before raise: $2000 * 52 = $104,000

2. Calculate the new weekly salary after the 5% raise:
   Raise percentage: 5%
   Raise amount per week: $2000 * 5% = $2000 * 0.05 = $100
   New weekly salary: $2000 + $100 = $2100

3. Calculate the annual salary after the raise:
   Annual salary after raise: $2100 * 52 = $109,200

4. Add the one-time monetary reward to the annual salary after the raise:
   One-time monetary reward: $5000
   Total annual earnings: $109,200 + $5000 = $114,200

Therefore, John made $114,200 that year.

"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the total for each meal and then sum them up.

For the sandwiches:
- He ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
- Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
- So, for sandwiches, he used 7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices.

For the omelets:
- He ate omelets for breakfast 3 days.
- Each omelet used 1 more slice than a sandwich, so 2 slices + 1 slice = 3 slices per omelet.
- So, for omelets, he used 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices.

For the macaroni and cheese:
- He used 8 slices of cheese for the entire dish.

Now, we add up all the slices of cheese used:
- Sandwiches: 14 slices
- Omelets: 9 slices
- Macaroni and cheese: 8 slices

Total slices of cheese used = 14 slices + 9 slices + 8 slices = 31 slices.

"To determine the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the lowest score among the first five tests.
2. Calculate the total points needed for an average of 93 over the five highest scores.
3. Calculate the sum of the first five test scores, excluding the lowest score.
4. Determine the score needed on the sixth test to reach the total points needed for the average.

First, let's identify the lowest score among the first five tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71.

Next, we calculate the total points needed for an average of 93 over the five highest scores. The formula for the average is:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of scores}}{\text{Number of scores}} \]

We want the average to be 93 over 5 scores, so the total points needed are:

\[ 93 \times 5 = 465 \]

Now, we calculate the sum of the first five test scores, excluding the lowest score (71):

\[ 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367 \]

To find out what Brinley needs on the sixth test, we subtract the sum of the four highest scores from the total points needed:

\[ 465 - 367 = 98 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 98 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score.

"To calculate the total kilometers Michael rode, we need to break it down into two parts: the first four weeks and the following three weeks.

For the first four weeks:
- He rides 5 times a week.
- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- So, each week he rides 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rides 4 * 125 = 500 kilometers.

For the following three weeks:
- He rides 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- So, each week he rides 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rides 3 * 120 = 360 kilometers.

Adding the two parts together:
- Total kilometers = 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40g. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g per chocolate bar = 1000g

Next, we need to find the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can find the weight of a candied apple by dividing the weight of a chocolate bar by 2:
40g per chocolate bar / 2 = 20g per candied apple

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the candied apples:
80 candied apples * 20g per candied apple = 1600g

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag:
1000g (chocolate bars) + 1600g (candied apples) = 2600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams.

On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, we add the number of cakes from each day together:
4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76 cakes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since one plate costs $6000, half a dozen (which is 6) plates would cost:

6 plates * $6000/plate = $36000

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of these plates. So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:

$36000 - $1200 = $34800

Since twenty dozen cups are equal to 20 * 12 = 240 cups, we can find the cost of each cup by dividing the total cost of the cups by the number of cups:

$34800 / 240 cups = $145/cup

So, the total cost of buying each cup is $145.

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and the total amount of money she will have after babysitting and mowing the lawn.

The total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is:
$30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs:
$70 (total cost) - $10 (saved) = $60

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns:
4 * $5 = $20

After babysitting, the total amount Sara will have is:
$10 (saved) + $20 (babysitting) = $30

The remaining amount Sara needs to earn by mowing the lawn is:
$70 (total cost) - $30 (total after babysitting) = $40

Since Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, the number of times she must mow the lawn is:
$40 (remaining amount) / $4 (per lawn) = 10

Sara must mow the lawn 10 times.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

According to the problem, we have two equations:

1. The total number of eggs collected per day is 42, which is the sum of the eggs produced by the red and white chickens:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

2. There are two more white chickens than red chickens:
\[ W = R + 2 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( R \):

\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle and then divide that by his walking speed.

The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:
P = 2 * (length + width)

Given the dimensions of the park:
Length (L) = 6 miles
Width (W) = 1.5 miles

We can calculate the perimeter as follows:
P = 2 * (6 + 1.5)
P = 2 * 7.5
P = 15 miles

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours (T) he spends walking, we use the formula:
T = Distance / Speed

So, the time spent walking is:
T = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
T = 5 hours

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the edge of the park.

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. We know that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the small pool was \( S + 4 \times 4 \) gallons (since 16 gallons have leaked out in the last 4 minutes), and the amount of water in the big pool was \( B + 4 \times 4 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To find Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months, we need to calculate the total amount she owes and then subtract the total amount she has paid.

First, we calculate the total amount Janeth owes, which is the principal plus the 10% interest:
Total amount owed = Principal + (Principal * Interest Rate)
Total amount owed = $2000 + ($2000 * 0.10)
Total amount owed = $2000 + $200
Total amount owed = $2200

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will have paid after 12 months:
Total amount paid = Monthly Payment * Number of Payments
Total amount paid = $165 * 12
Total amount paid = $1980

Now, we can find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount owed:
Remaining balance = Total amount owed - Total amount paid
Remaining balance = $2200 - $1980
Remaining balance = $220

So, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be $220.

One-third of 36 penguins is:
36 / 3 = 12 penguins

Since two-thirds of the penguins (one-third for swimming and one-third for eating) are no longer sunbathing, we have:
2 * 12 = 24 penguins

Now, we subtract the 24 penguins that are no longer sunbathing from the total number of penguins:
36 - 24 = 12 penguins

So, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:

"To determine how many vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate the total number of tomatoes he and his girlfriend will consume per week.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so in a week (7 days), he eats:
6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats:
42 tomatoes/week / 2 = 21 tomatoes/week

Together, they eat:
42 tomatoes/week (Steve) + 21 tomatoes/week (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week

Now, if a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week is:
63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine/week = 21 vines

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines to meet their weekly tomato consumption.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial pens Ram buys and the additional pens he can create by mixing the ink from the empty ones.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. So, from the 25 empty pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.
3. After using these 5 new pens, he will have 5 more empty pens, which he can again mix to make 1 more pen.
4. After using this 1 pen, he will have 1 more empty pen, but he won't have enough to make another pen since he needs 5 empty pens to make one new pen.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to use is the initial 25 pens plus the 5 new pens plus the 1 additional pen he made.

25 (initial pens) + 5 (first batch of new pens) + 1 (second batch of new pens) = 31 pens

"To find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we can start by determining the age of each girl based on the information provided.

Jessa's age is given as 20 years old.

Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan's age is:
20 years (Jessa's age) + 5 years = 25 years

Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is:
25 years (Joan's age) - 2 years = 23 years

Now, we can find the sum of their ages:
20 years (Jessa) + 25 years (Joan) + 23 years (Mary) = 68 years

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 68 years.

"To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Calculate the number of students remaining after exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C, which is the rest of the students.

Let's start with step 1:

1. 30% of the students went out through exit A.
   30% of 1000 students = 0.30 * 1000 = 300 students

Now, step 2:

2. The number of students remaining after exit A is:
   1000 students - 300 students = 700 students

Next, step 3:

3. 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B.
   3/5 of 700 students = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students

Finally, step 4:

4. The number of students who went out through exit C is the rest of the students:
   700 students - 420 students = 280 students

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that John has 54 candies.
2. John has twice as many candies as Robert, so Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.
3. James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.
4. To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has: 54 - 33 = 21.

So, John has 21 more candies than James.

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of pen pals Mike is still in contact with.
2. Calculate the total number of letters he receives each week.
3. Calculate the total number of pages he needs to write in response.
4. Determine the total time he spends writing those pages.
5. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Step 1: Mike was a pen pal with 5 people and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he is still in contact with:
5 - 2 = 3 people

Step 2: Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, so the total number of letters he receives each week is:
3 * 2 = 6 letters

Step 3: Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he needs to write in response is:
6 * 5 = 30 pages

Step 4: Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing those pages is:
30 * 6 = 180 minutes

Step 5: To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
180 / 60 = 3 hours

So, Mike spends 3 hours writing letters each week.

"To calculate the remaining minutes in Jason's phone plan, we need to consider the following:

1. Jason's phone plan includes 1000 minutes per month.
2. He has a 15-minute call with his boss every day.
3. He has used an additional 300 minutes for calls to other people this month.
4. The month has 30 days.

First, we calculate the total minutes used for the daily calls with his boss:
15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Next, we add the extra minutes used for calls to other people:
450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the monthly plan to find out how many minutes are left:
1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

So, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan for this month.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries from Griffin, so Griffin has 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes 2 * 5 = 10 fries from Griffin. Now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.
4. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle took, so Colby takes 5 - 3 = 2 fries from Griffin. Now Griffin has 9 - 2 = 7 fries left.
5. Ginger gives Griffin some fries, and after that, Griffin has 27 fries.

To find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin, we need to calculate the difference between the number of fries Griffin had after Colby took some and the number of fries Griffin had at the end.

So, Ginger gave Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

"To find the number of fish in each aquarium, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( f \).

The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Since there are the same number of fish in each aquarium, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).

So we can write the equation as:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ f = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To find out how much Jean paid for the makeup artist's services, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the makeup artist's services.
2. Calculate the weekly cost of the makeup artist's services.
3. Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks.
4. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Step 1: Daily cost
The makeup artist charges $250 per hour and it takes 6 hours to do the makeup each day.
Daily cost = $250/hour * 6 hours = $1500

Step 2: Weekly cost
The makeup is needed 4 times a week.
Weekly cost = $1500/day * 4 days = $6000

Step 3: Total cost for 5 weeks
The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
Total cost = $6000/week * 5 weeks = $30,000

Step 4: Apply the 10% discount
The makeup artist gives a 10% discount.
Discount amount = $30,000 * 10% = $3000
Final cost after discount = $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000

"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the number of cookies each of them ate and then convert that into calories.

First, let's calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on each day:

- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate:

- Sue's total cookies: 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies.
- Her sister's total cookies: 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies.

Next, we'll convert the number of cookies into calories:

- Sue's total calories: 46 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories.
- Her sister's total calories: 18 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories.

Finally, we'll find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister:

4. Subtract the number of girls in the third class from the total number of students in the third class to find the number of boys in the third class.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total number of students in the school:
   3 classes * 20 students/class = 60 students

2. Total number of girls in the school (50% of the total students):
   60 students * 50% = 30 girls

3. Number of girls in the third class:
   30 girls (total) - 15 girls (first class) - 12 girls (second class) = 3 girls

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.
2. Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars.
3. Today, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, which means he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Now, we can find out how many wolves Rick killed today. Since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and he killed 12 cougars, he killed 3 * 12 = 36 wolves today.

Now we can add up all the animals Rick killed:

- Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
- Today: 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals

Total animals killed: 25 + 48 = 73

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first determine how many times Anne went down the slide. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, who went down 30 times.

First, we calculate 30% of Mitchel's 30 slides:
30% of 30 = 0.30 * 30 = 9

Now, we subtract that from Mitchel's total to find Anne's total:
Anne's slides = Mitchel's slides - 30% of Mitchel's slides
Anne's slides = 30 - 9 = 21

Now that we know Anne went down the slide 21 times, we can calculate how many times Robert went down the slide, which is 4 times as much as Anne:
Robert's slides = 4 * Anne's slides
Robert's slides = 4 * 21 = 84

So, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

Each stall originally had 20 cows, and now 2 more cows are added to each stall, making it:

20 original cows + 2 new cows = 22 cows per stall

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 22 cows, we multiply 22 by 8:

22 cows per stall * 8 stalls = 176 cows

So, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is 176.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by termites from the total weight to find the remaining weight.

Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree.
- The tree is 200 feet tall.
- Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.
- There are 200 / 10 = 20 sections in the tree.
- The total weight of the tree is 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds.

Step 2: Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
- The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood.
- The weight of the wood eaten is 30% of 8000 pounds = 0.30 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds.

Step 3: Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by termites from the total weight.
- The remaining weight of the tree is 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.

The final weight of the redwood tree is 5600 pounds.

"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \).

From the problem, we know that:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: \( A_a = J_a + 8 \)
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: \( A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \)
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: \( J_b = J_a + 4 \)
4. Andrea has 52 apples: \( A_a = 52 \)

Using the first equation and the fourth piece of information, we can find the number of apples Jamal has:
\( 52 = J_a + 8 \)
\( J_a = 52 - 8 \)
\( J_a = 44 \)

Now we can find the number of bananas Jamal has using the third equation:
\( J_b = J_a + 4 \)
\( J_b = 44 + 4 \)
\( J_b = 48 \)

Now we can find the number of bananas Andrea has using the second equation:
\( A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \)
\( A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \)
\( A_b = 24 \)

Now we can calculate the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have:
Total fruits = \( A_a + A_b + J_a + J_b \)
Total fruits = \( 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \)
Total fruits = \( 168 \)

"To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then subtract her budget from this total cost.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price:
Brokerage fee = 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
Transfer fee = 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

The total cost of the house is the sum of the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee:
Total cost = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
Total cost = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000
Total cost = $409,500

Now, we subtract Mrs. Cruz's budget from the total cost to find out how much more the house costs:
Amount over budget = Total cost - Budget
Amount over budget = $409,500 - $400,000
Amount over budget = $9,500

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time taken for the following steps:

1. Time to heat the oil to 300 degrees: 20 minutes.
2. Time to heat the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees: 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees.
3. Time to cook the chicken: 5 minutes less than the time it took to warm up the oil to 400 degrees.

Let's calculate the time for step 2:
40% of 20 minutes is 0.40 * 20 = 8 minutes.
So, the time to heat the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees is 20 minutes + 8 minutes = 28 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time for step 3:
The total time to warm up the oil to 400 degrees is 20 minutes + 28 minutes = 48 minutes.
The time to cook the chicken is 5 minutes less than 48 minutes, which is 48 minutes - 5 minutes = 43 minutes.

Finally, we add up all the times to get the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:

   - So, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is 3 bedrooms * 2 windows/bedroom = 6 windows.

2. Add the additional windows in one house that are not connected to bedrooms:
   - There are 4 additional windows in one house.
   - So, the total number of windows in one house is 6 windows (from bedrooms) + 4 windows (additional) = 10 windows.

3. Since John has 2 houses, we need to double the number of windows in one house to get the total number of windows in both houses:
   - Total number of windows in both houses is 2 houses * 10 windows/house = 20 windows.

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is 20.

"To find out how much change the mother receives, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and then subtract that from the $20 she paid.

The total cost of the items is:
$4.20 (cocoa) + $9.45 (laundry) + $1.35 (pasta) = $15.00

Now, subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
$20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00

The cashier gives back $5.00 in change.

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we can start by calculating the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette, and then subtracting these from the total number of stitches to find the number of stitches left for the sleeves.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches that the body of the sweater takes, so:
Collar stitches = 900 stitches / 10 = 90 stitches

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so:
Rosette stitches = 90 stitches * 2 = 180 stitches

The total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800, so we can subtract the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette to find the number of stitches left for the sleeves:
Stitches left for sleeves = 1800 stitches - (900 stitches + 90 stitches + 180 stitches)
Stitches left for sleeves = 1800 stitches - 1170 stitches
Stitches left for sleeves = 630 stitches

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2 to find the number of stitches per sleeve:
Stitches per sleeve = 630 stitches / 2 = 315 stitches

"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately and then add them together.

The cost for the tomato seeds is:
20 packets * $40 per packet = $800

The cost for the celery seeds is:
80 packets * $30 per packet = $2400

The total cost for all the seeds is:
$800 (tomato seeds) + $2400 (celery seeds) = $3200

Therefore, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds.

"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part of his role and then sum them up.

1. The solo song has 54 lines, and all of them are his to memorize.
2. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 54 * 2 = 108 lines in total. However, only a third of these lines are his, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.
3. The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines in total. Four-fifths of these lines are his, so he has to memorize 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, we add up all the lines he has to memorize:
- Solo song: 54 lines
- First scene: 36 lines
- Second scene: 48 lines

Total lines to memorize: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138

"To find out how many cards had the letter D on them, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of cards with the letter A.
2. Subtract the number of A cards from the total to find the remaining cards.
3. Calculate the number of cards with the letter B from the remaining cards.
4. Subtract the number of B cards from the remaining to find the new remaining cards.
5. Calculate the number of cards with the letter C from the new remaining cards.
6. Subtract the number of C cards from the new remaining to find the number of D cards.

Let's do the math:

1. Number of A cards: \( \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \)
2. Remaining cards after A: \( 80 - 32 = 48 \)
3. Number of B cards: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \)
4. Remaining cards after B: \( 48 - 24 = 24 \)
5. Number of C cards: \( \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \)
6. Remaining cards after C (which are D cards): \( 24 - 15 = 9 \)

So, the number of cards with the letter D on them is 9.

"To find out how many hours it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the total time for each type of hole and then sum them up.

For the small holes:
- It takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- For 30 small holes, it will take 30 * 3 = 90 minutes.

For the large holes:
- It takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- For 15 large holes, it will take 15 * 10 = 150 minutes.

Now, we add the time for the small holes and the large holes to get the total time in minutes:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
- Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours.

"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we can start with the sum of their current ages and then add 10 years for each of them.

The sum of their current ages is 20. In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older, so we add 10 years for Mico and 10 years for Marco, which is a total of 20 years added to their current combined age.

So, the calculation is:

20 (current sum of ages) + 10 (additional years for Mico) + 10 (additional years for Marco) = 20 + 10 + 10 = 40

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40.

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

According to the problem, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write the first equation as:
\[ R = 6S \]

In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write the second equation as:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now we can substitute the value of \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expanding the equation, we get:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To find out how much Peter paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately and then add them together.

The cost of the popsicles is:
20 popsicles * $0.25 per popsicle = $5.00

The cost of the ice cream bars is:
4 ice cream bars * $0.50 per ice cream bar = $2.00

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total cost:
$5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00

So, Peter paid a total of $7.00.

"To find half the number of spots all the snakes have combined, we first need to determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can set up the following equation:

Let the number of spots on a mamba be \( x \).
Then the number of spots on a cobra is \( 2x \).

We know that a cobra has 70 spots, so:
\( 2x = 70 \)
\( x = 70 / 2 \)
\( x = 35 \)

So, a mamba has 35 spots.

Now, we can calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park:

Total spots for cobras = Number of cobras * Spots per cobra
Total spots for cobras = 40 * 70
Total spots for cobras = 2800

Total spots for mambas = Number of mambas * Spots per mamba
Total spots for mambas = 60 * 35
Total spots for mambas = 2100

Total spots for all snakes = Total spots for cobras + Total spots for mambas
Total spots for all snakes = 2800 + 2100
Total spots for all snakes = 4900

Half the number of spots they all have combined is:
Half the total spots = Total spots for all snakes / 2
Half the total spots = 4900 / 2
Half the total spots = 2450

"To determine how many dollars Maddy will spend on pizza, we need to calculate the total number of people attending the soccer game and then figure out how many pizzas are needed to serve everyone.

First, let's calculate the total number of people:
- There are 12 team members.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 guests.
- There are 3 coaches.

Adding these together, we get:
12 (team members) + 24 (guests) + 3 (coaches) = 39 people.

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3:
39 people / 3 people per pizza = 13 pizzas.

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the pizzas:
13 pizzas * $15 per pizza = $195.

So, Maddy will spend $195 on pizza.

"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones and then determine how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 of them, so the total length of the topaz gemstones is:
8 gemstones * 1 inch/gemstone = 8 inches

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, so the length available for the sterling silver beads is:
25 inches (total length) - 8 inches (topaz gemstones) = 17 inches

Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, so the number of sterling silver beads that can fit into the 17 inches is:
17 inches / (1/4 inch/bead) = 17 * 4 beads = 68 beads

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. In the second week, they each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week.

So, in the second week:
- Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories
- Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories
- Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories

Now, let's add the stories from both weeks for each of them:
- Alani's total: 20 (first week) + 40 (second week) = 60 stories
- Braylen's total: 40 (first week) + 80 (second week) = 120 stories
- Margot's total: 60 (first week) + 120 (second week) = 180 stories

Finally, we add all their stories together to get the total number of stories written by the family:
60 (Alani) + 120 (Braylen) + 180 (Margot) = 360 stories

"To find the number of 5-star rows, we first need to calculate the total number of stars in the 8-star rows and the 6-star rows, and then subtract that from the total number of stars to find out how many stars are in the 5-star rows. After that, we can determine the number of 5-star rows.

There are three rows of 8 stars, so:
3 rows * 8 stars/row = 24 stars

There are two rows of 6 stars, so:
2 rows * 6 stars/row = 12 stars

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is:
24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars

The total number of stars on the flag is 76, so the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:
76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars

To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5:
40 stars / 5 stars/row = 8 rows

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip, we first need to calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones and then divide that by the weight capacity of one truck.

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

The delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds each. To find out how many trucks are needed, we divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight capacity of one truck:
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks

Since you can't have a fraction of a truck, and all flagstones must be transported, the company will need 3 trucks to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

To find the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values for the car in the slow lane:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

1. Determine the number of medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
2. Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. This is 22 (Ali's medals) + 17 (Izzy's medals) = 39 medals.
3. Since the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out, we can find the total number of medals given out by multiplying their total by 10. So, 39 * 10 = 390 medals.

The total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

"To calculate Susan's earnings, we need to determine the total time she spends working, excluding her half-hour pause.

The total time from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this is equivalent to 180 minutes. If Susan takes a half-hour pause, she is not working for 30 minutes. Therefore, the total working time is:

180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how much she earns in 150 minutes, we divide the total working time by the time it takes to earn $5 and then multiply by the amount earned in that time:

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals
15 intervals * $5 = $75

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

2. Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
3. Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, in the fourth round, each player who has over 20 points gets an extra point:

- Mike has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point: 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point: 18 points.
- Tony has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point: 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Finally, we add up all the points to get the total:

- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83

"To calculate the total cost John pays for the driving service per year, we need to consider both the mileage cost and the monthly bonus.

First, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- John's work is 30 miles away, so a round trip is 60 miles.
- He goes to work 5 days a week, so in a week, he travels 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week.
- Over 50 weeks, he travels 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.
- At a rate of $2 per mile, the cost for the miles driven is 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000/year.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the monthly bonus:
- He gives a $150 bonus per month.
- There are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus per year is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year.

Now, we add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to get the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of miles driven + total bonus
- Total cost = $30,000/year + $1,800/year = $31,800/year.

Therefore, John pays $31,800 a year for the driving service.

"To find out how much money Elise earned in the second year, we need to determine how many books she sold in that year. We can do this by first calculating the total number of books sold over the three years and then subtracting the number of books sold in the first and third years.

We know the following:
- Total number of books: 250
- Number of unsold books: 50
- Number of books sold in the third year: 45
- Number of books sold in the first year: 2 * (number of books sold in the third year)

Let's calculate the number of books sold in the first year:
Number of books sold in the first year = 2 * 45 = 90

Now, let's calculate the total number of books sold:
Total number of books sold = Total number of books - Number of unsold books
Total number of books sold = 250 - 50 = 200

Next, we calculate the number of books sold in the second year:
Number of books sold in the second year = Total number of books sold - (Number of books sold in the first year + Number of books sold in the third year)
Number of books sold in the second year = 200 - (90 + 45)
Number of books sold in the second year = 200 - 135
Number of books sold in the second year = 65

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:
Total amount earned in the second year = Number of books sold in the second year * Price per book
Total amount earned in the second year = 65 * 20
Total amount earned in the second year = 1300

"To calculate Watson's earnings for April, we need to know the number of working days in April and then calculate his earnings based on his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

April typically has 30 days. Since Watson works five days a week, we need to determine the number of weeks in April and the number of working days.

There are 4 full weeks in April, which gives us 20 working days (4 weeks * 5 days/week). If April starts on a weekday, there would be an additional working day, making it 21 working days. If April starts on a weekend, there would be 20 working days.

Let's assume the best-case scenario for Watson, where April has 21 working days (since the question states the company performed very well for the whole month, we'll assume the maximum possible working days).

Now, let's calculate his earnings:

- Hourly wage: $10/hour
- Hours per day: 10 hours
- Working days in April: 21 days
- Weekly bonus: $300 (since the company performed very well, he gets this bonus for each of the 4 weeks in April)

Earnings from hourly wage:
21 days * 10 hours/day * $10/hour = $2,100

Earnings from weekly bonus:
4 weeks * $300/week = $1,200

Total earnings for April:
$2,100 (hourly wage) + $1,200 (bonus) = $3,300

Therefore, Watson made $3,300 in April.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week and then calculate how long it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight, given that she needs 4 weeks to lose what Joey loses in one week.

First, we find out how much weight Joey loses in one week:
Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so in one week, Joey loses:
8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Now, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in one week). To lose 8 pounds, which is the total amount Joey loses in 4 weeks, we calculate the number of weeks it will take Sandy as follows:
8 pounds / 2 pounds per 4 weeks = 4 * 4 weeks = 16 weeks

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after drinking Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum for fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of new arms and legs separately and then add them together.

An extra arm grows every 3 days, so in 15 days, the number of new arms will be:
15 days / 3 days per arm = 5 new arms

An extra leg grows every 5 days, so in 15 days, the number of new legs will be:
15 days / 5 days per leg = 3 new legs

Adding the new arms and legs together gives us the total number of new limbs:
5 new arms + 3 new legs = 8 new limbs

"Theo's total expenses can be calculated as follows:

1. Cost of 6 business suits: 6 * $100 = $600
2. Cost of 3 suitcases: 3 * $50 = $150
3. Cost of the flight ticket: 5 * $100 (cost of a business suit) + $700 = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
Total expenses = Cost of suits + Cost of suitcases + Cost of flight ticket
Total expenses = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the amount he has left to spend on gifts is:
Amount for gifts = Total money - (Total expenses + Savings)
Amount for gifts = $6000 - ($1950 + $2000)
Amount for gifts = $6000 - $3950
Amount for gifts = $2050

Theo has to spend $2050 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

"To calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to first determine the daily egg consumption and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Three people eat three eggs each day, so:
3 people * 3 eggs/person/day = 9 eggs/day

The remaining two people eat two eggs each day, so:
2 people * 2 eggs/person/day = 4 eggs/day

The total daily consumption is:
9 eggs/day + 4 eggs/day = 13 eggs/day

Now, to find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
13 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 91 eggs/week

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Cera is currently 46 years old.
2. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
3. Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
4. Currently, Noah is 20 + 6 = 26 years old.
5. Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times the age of Noah, so the population was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.
6. The population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, so the current population is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

The population of Chile now is 120,000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \). According to the problem, there are twice as many players on the offense, which would be \( 2D \), and half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, which would be \( \frac{1}{2}D \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. So we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]

To combine the terms, we need a common denominator, which is 2:

\[ \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{1D}{2} = 105 \]

\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

Now, we solve for \( D \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2 and then dividing by 7:

\[ 7D = 210 \]

\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]

\[ D = 30 \]

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To find the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has after buying from Johanna and receiving more from his father.
2. Multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to get the total weight.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of marbles.
- Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
- He already had 50 marbles in the store.
- His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

So, the total number of marbles Solomon has is:
20 (from Johanna) + 50 (already in the store) + 8 (from his father) = 78 marbles.

Step 2: Calculate the total weight.
- Each marble weighs 2 kgs.
- The total weight is 78 marbles * 2 kgs/marble = 156 kgs.

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 156 kgs.

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls and nongendered children based on the number of boys, and then add all the numbers together.

Given:
- The classroom has 30 boys.
- There are 3 times as many girls as boys.
- There are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys.

Let's calculate the number of girls:
Number of girls = 3 * Number of boys
Number of girls = 3 * 30
Number of girls = 90

Now, let's calculate the number of nongendered children:
Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * Number of boys
Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * 30
Number of nongendered children = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children
Total number of children = 30 + 90 + 3
Total number of children = 123

"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left, which means 1/4 of 40 people left the party. That's 40 / 4 = 10 people who left.

If 22 men stayed at the party, that means 25 (initial number of men) - 22 (men who stayed) = 3 men left the party.

Since 10 people left in total and 3 of them were men, the remaining 10 - 3 = 7 people who left must have been women.

Initially, there were 15 women, so the number of women left at the party is 15 (initial number of women) - 7 (women who left) = 8 women.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes and then calculate the total number of boxes needed for both Jam and Meg's pencils.

First, let's find out how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can set up the following equation to find the number of pencils per box:

3 * (number of pencils per box) + 2 loose pencils = 26 pencils

Let's solve for the number of pencils per box:

3 * (number of pencils per box) = 26 - 2
3 * (number of pencils per box) = 24
(number of pencils per box) = 24 / 3
(number of pencils per box) = 8

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together:

Jam's pencils: 3 boxes * 8 pencils/box + 2 loose pencils = 24 + 2 = 26 pencils
Meg's pencils: 46 pencils

Total pencils: 26 (Jam's) + 46 (Meg's) = 72 pencils

Now, we need to determine how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils, assuming that each box can hold 8 pencils:

Total boxes needed = Total pencils / Pencils per box
Total boxes needed = 72 / 8
Total boxes needed = 9

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To find out how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to calculate the total amount of liquid added to the coffee, which includes both the ice cubes and the cream.

First, we determine how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we divide 65 by 13 to find the number of ice cubes:

65 degrees / 13 degrees per ice cube = 5 ice cubes

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:

5 ice cubes * 12 milliliters per ice cube = 60 milliliters weaker

Additionally, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. So, the total amount by which the coffee is weakened is:

60 milliliters (from ice cubes) + 15 milliliters (from cream) = 75 milliliters

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of junior programmers.
2. Calculate the number of senior programmers.
3. Calculate the monthly pay for a senior programmer.
4. Calculate the total monthly pay for all junior programmers.
5. Calculate the total monthly pay for all senior programmers.
6. Add the total monthly pay for junior and senior programmers to get the total amount paid to all programmers.

Let's start with step 1:

1. The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees. Since the company has 100 employees, the number of junior programmers is:
   \( \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \)

2. The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers:
   \( \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \)

3. The monthly pay for a senior programmer is $400 more than a junior programmer, who is paid $2000 per month:
   \( \text{Monthly pay for a senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \)

4. The total monthly pay for all junior programmers is:
   \( \text{Total pay for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \)

5. The total monthly pay for all senior programmers is:
   \( \text{Total pay for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \)

6. The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:
   \( \text{Total pay for all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \)

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the number of people on the bus is now \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got in, so the number of people on the bus is now \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

We know that after the second stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus heading to the third stop. So we can set up the following equation:

\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = 20 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 5 - 7 + 8 = 20 \]
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal.

"To calculate how long it will take to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to determine the remaining percentage of charge required:

100% - 60% = 40%

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. To find out how many minutes it will take to charge 40 percentage-points, we multiply the number of percentage-points by the time it takes to charge one percentage-point:

40 percentage-points * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes

Now, to convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%.

- State tax rate: 20%
- Annual state tax: $30,000 * 20% = $6,000
- Net pay for Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual gross pay: $42,000

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chickens and cows Farmer Brown has, and then calculate the total number of legs.

Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( Ch \).

According to the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of animals is 60, so \( C + Ch = 60 \).
2. There are twice as many chickens as cows, so \( Ch = 2C \).

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( C \):
\( C + 2C = 60 \)
\( 3C = 60 \)
\( C = 20 \)

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\( Ch = 2C \)
\( Ch = 2 \times 20 \)
\( Ch = 40 \)

Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. So, the total number of legs is:
\( (20 \text{ cows} \times 4 \text{ legs per cow}) + (40 \text{ chickens} \times 2 \text{ legs per chicken}) \)

$1100/day - $1000/day = $100/day

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original daily revenue from tractors and multiply by 100:
($100/day / $1000/day) * 100 = 10%

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

"To calculate the total amount of money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to add up the monthly costs and then multiply by 12 (the number of months in a year).

First, we calculate the monthly cost of food:
$25 per week * 4 weeks per month = $100 per month

Next, we add the monthly costs of treats and medicine:
$100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220 per month

Finally, we calculate the yearly cost:
$220 per month * 12 months per year = $2640 per year

- Monday: 1 hour of yoga
- Tuesday: 3 times the duration of Monday's yoga, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours
- Wednesday: 0.5 hours (30 minutes) of cheese tasting
- Thursday: Half the duration of the cooking class, which is 0.5 * 3 = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours of errands

Now, let's add up the total time spent:

1 (Monday) + 3 (Tuesday) + 0.5 (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 8 hours

"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots she donates and then subtract that from the number of plant pots she originally bought.

The school asked for 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses. This means they asked for:
- 30 plant pots for the daisies
- 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses

The total number of plant pots the school asked for is:
30 (daisies) + 60 (roses) = 90 plant pots

April had already bought 100 plant pots. After donating the 90 plant pots to the school, she has:
100 (initially bought) - 90 (donated) = 10 plant pots left over

"To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to first determine the total time he spent on vacation. We know that the time he spent watching shows (3 shows * 2 hours each) and the time he spent boating and swimming is 30% of his total vacation time.

Let's calculate the time spent on these activities:
- Time spent boating: 6 hours
- Time spent swimming: 6 / 2 = 3 hours
- Time spent watching shows: 3 * 2 = 6 hours

Total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows:
6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (shows) = 15 hours

This 15 hours is 30% of his total vacation time. Let's denote the total vacation time as T. We can set up the equation:
15 = 0.30 * T

Now we solve for T:
T = 15 / 0.30
T = 50 hours

Now that we know the total vacation time, we can calculate the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time:
Time spent sightseeing = 0.40 * T
Time spent sightseeing = 0.40 * 50
Time spent sightseeing = 20 hours

So, John spent 20 hours sightseeing.

"To find out how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and add that to her current savings. Then we subtract that total from the cost of the phone.

First, we calculate her earnings from the first job:
$10 per hour * 20 hours = $200

Next, we calculate her earnings from the second job:
$5 per hour * 15 hours = $75

Now, we add her earnings from both jobs:
$200 + $75 = $275

We then add her current savings to her total earnings:
$80 + $275 = $355

Finally, we subtract this total from the cost of the phone to find out how much more she needs to save:
$400 - $355 = $45

So, Annabelle still needs to save $45.

"To find the height of the tallest tree, we first need to determine the heights of the other two trees.

The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.

The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so its height is:
6 feet + 5 feet = 11 feet.

The combined height of the shortest and the second tree is:
6 feet + 11 feet = 17 feet.

The tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree, so its height is:
17 feet * 2 = 34 feet.

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars and teddy bears that Dean bought.

The cost of 6 toy cars at $2 each is:
6 * $2 = $12

The cost of 5 teddy bears at $1 each is:
5 * $1 = $5

The total cost of the toys is:
$12 + $5 = $17

Dean initially had $28 and spent $17, so he has:
$28 - $17 = $11

After his mother gives him an extra $10, Dean has:
$11 + $10 = $21

So, the final amount of money Dean has left is:

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for one person (Morgan) to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then we can see how many people can be accommodated within the $90 budget.

The cost for one person is:
- Mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- Go-karts (2 rides): $10 * 2 = $20

Total cost for one person: $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Now, we need to see how many people can be accommodated with the $90 budget. Since Morgan is also part of the group, we need to include her in the count.

$90 / $30 = 3

This means that the budget can cover the cost for 3 people, which includes Morgan and 2 friends.

(Note: The number 2 represents the number of friends Morgan can invite, not including herself.)"
"Marisa receives $5 each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops every day. The cost of the lollipops per day is:

4 lollipops * $0.25 per lollipop = $1.00

So, the amount she saves each day is:

$5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00

If she saves for 5 days, the total amount saved is:

$4.00 * 5 days = $20.00

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Billy starts with $10.
2. He buys candy at $1.5 per pound.
3. After buying the candy, he has some change left.
4. He spends half of his change on gumballs, which cost $0.05 each.
5. He bought 40 gumballs.

First, we need to find out how much money Billy spent on the gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05 and he bought 40, the total cost for the gumballs is:

40 gumballs * $0.05/gumball = $2.00

Since this $2.00 is half of his change, the total change he had after buying the candy is:

$2.00 * 2 = $4.00

Now, we know that Billy had $4.00 left after buying the candy. Since he started with $10, the amount he spent on candy is:

$10.00 - $4.00 = $6.00

Finally, to find out how many pounds of candy he bought, we divide the amount he spent on candy by the cost per pound:

$6.00 / $1.50/pound = 4 pounds

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver is 5 years less than twice his son's age. We can write this as an equation:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 2x = 45 + 5 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the train travels in one complete trip between the three cities, then multiply that by the number of trips it makes in a day, and finally determine how many days it can operate before reaching the 18,000-mile service interval.

1. Calculate the distance from the third city to the first city:
   The combined distance from the first to the second and then to the third city is 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles.
   The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than 175 miles, which is 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.

2. Calculate the total distance for one complete trip:
   The total distance for one trip is the sum of the distances between all three cities: 75 miles + 100 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.

3. Calculate the total distance traveled in one day:
   Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is 300 miles * 3 = 900 miles.

4. Calculate the number of days before service is needed:
   The train needs service every 18,000 miles, so we divide 18,000 miles by the daily distance to find out how many days it can go without service: 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.

The train goes 20 days between services.

"To find out how many pounds of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to determine the amount of stuffing required for a collie bed. Since a collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed, we can calculate it as follows:

Average stuffing for a collie bed = (Stuffing for a Rottweiler bed + Stuffing for a chihuahua bed) / 2
Average stuffing for a collie bed = (8 pounds + 2 pounds) / 2
Average stuffing for a collie bed = 10 pounds / 2
Average stuffing for a collie bed = 5 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds:

Total stuffing for chihuahua beds = 4 beds * 2 pounds/bed
Total stuffing for chihuahua beds = 8 pounds

Total stuffing for collie beds = 3 beds * 5 pounds/bed
Total stuffing for collie beds = 15 pounds

Total stuffing needed = Total stuffing for chihuahua beds + Total stuffing for collie beds
Total stuffing needed = 8 pounds + 15 pounds
Total stuffing needed = 23 pounds

"To calculate the total time John spent on his trip, we need to calculate the time for each leg of the journey and then sum them up.

1. The first leg of the trip is 200 miles plus a 10-mile detour, which makes it 210 miles. At a speed of 70 mph, the time taken for this part of the trip is:
   Time = Distance / Speed
   Time = 210 miles / 70 mph
   Time = 3 hours

2. The second leg of the trip is 240 miles at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:
   Time = Distance / Speed
   Time = 240 miles / 80 mph
   Time = 3 hours

Now, we add the times for both legs of the trip to get the total time:
Total time = Time for first leg + Time for second leg
Total time = 3 hours + 3 hours
Total time = 6 hours

2. Subtract the number of boys who were absent on Friday from the total number of boys.

First, we know there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is:

96 (total students) - 43 (girls) = 53 boys

On Friday, 4 boys were absent. So, the number of boys present at school on Friday is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks be \( x \). According to the problem, \( x = 3 \).

2. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of mask refusers minus 5. So, the number of shoplifters is \( 4x - 5 \).

3. The number of people kicked out for physical violence is three times the number of shoplifters. So, the number of people kicked out for physical violence is \( 3(4x - 5) \).

4. The total number of people kicked out is the sum of those kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, physical violence, and other reasons. We know the total is 50.

Let's denote the number of people kicked out for other reasons as \( y \).

The equation representing the total number of people kicked out is:
\[ x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) + y = 50 \]

Now we can substitute \( x = 3 \) into the equation and solve for \( y \).

\[ 3 + (4 \cdot 3 - 5) + 3(4 \cdot 3 - 5) + y = 50 \]
\[ 3 + (12 - 5) + 3(12 - 5) + y = 50 \]
\[ 3 + 7 + 3 \cdot 7 + y = 50 \]
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 + y = 50 \]
\[ 31 + y = 50 \]
\[ y = 50 - 31 \]
\[ y = 19 \]

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 19.

"To find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to determine how many points she has now and then subtract the 14 points she recently scored.

We know that after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. Sara has 8 points, so three times more than Sara's points would be:

3 * 8 = 24

This means Erin has 24 points after scoring the additional 14 points. To find out how many points Erin had before, we subtract the 14 points she scored:

24 - 14 = 10

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points.

3. **Pins cost**: 2 seniors * $5/pin = $10
4. **Cords cost**: 1/4 of 44 seniors are officers, so 44 / 4 = 11 officers, and 11 * $12/cord = $132

Now, we add all the costs together:

$880 (frames) + $176 (etching) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198

The total amount spent on the senior gifts is $1198.

"To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pupils who like blue.
2. Calculate the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils.
3. Subtract the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total to find the number who like yellow.

Step 1: Number of pupils who like blue
Half of the class likes blue, so:
40 pupils / 2 = 20 pupils like blue.

Step 2: Number of pupils who like green
One-fourth of the remaining pupils (after those who like blue are accounted for) like green, so:
(40 pupils - 20 pupils) / 4 = 20 pupils / 4 = 5 pupils like green.

Step 3: Number of pupils who like yellow

"To find out how many apples Lucy picked over the three days, we need to determine the number of apples she picked each day and then sum them up.

First, we know that Lucy sold all the apples she picked on Monday for $56. Since she sells apples at $4 each, we can calculate the number of apples she sold on Monday by dividing the total amount of money by the price per apple:

Number of apples sold on Monday = Total money from Monday / Price per apple
Number of apples sold on Monday = $56 / $4
Number of apples sold on Monday = 14

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, so:

Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 2 * Number of apples picked on Tuesday
Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 2 * 12
Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 24

Now, we can sum up the number of apples picked over the three days:

Total number of apples picked = Number of apples picked on Monday + Number of apples picked on Tuesday + Number of apples picked on Wednesday
Total number of apples picked = 14 + 12 + 24
Total number of apples picked = 50

"To calculate the monthly payment Karan has to make, we need to determine the total amount she will owe after the five months, including the interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, we calculate the interest for the five months. The annual interest rate is 10%, so the monthly interest rate is 10% divided by 12 months, which is 0.8333% per month.

The formula to calculate the total interest for a simple interest loan is:

\[ \text{Total Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Where:
- Principal is the amount borrowed ($3,650),
- Rate is the monthly interest rate (0.8333% or 0.008333 as a decimal),
- Time is the duration of the loan in months (5 months).

Let's calculate the total interest:

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 3650 \times 0.008333 \times 5 \]

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 3650 \times 0.041665 \]

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 152.49425 \]

Now, we add the total interest to the principal to get the total amount to be repaid:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Total Interest} \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.49425 \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.49425 \]

Finally, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.49425}{5} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.49885 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.50 \]

"To determine Millie's profit per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade.
3. Subtract the cost of supplies from the total revenue to find the total profit.
4. Calculate the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade.
5. Divide the total profit by the number of hours to find the profit per hour.

Let's go through each step:

1. Millie can make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups, so the total number of cups is:
   3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

2. If she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is:
   36 cups * $1/cup = $36

3. The cost of supplies is $18, so the total profit is:
   $36 (revenue) - $18 (cost) = $18

4. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour, so the number of hours to sell all the lemonade is:
   36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours

5. The profit per hour is the total profit divided by the number of hours:

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up the following equation based on the information given:

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first. He sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, so he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. According to the problem, the amount of land he has left is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write:

\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To find \( x \), we can solve for it by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]

\[ x = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

On the day of the performance, only the female members are performing, and half of them can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, the number of girls who can make it to the performance is:

Number of girls performing = 26 / 2 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers also decide to sing with them, so we add them to the number of girls performing:

Total number of people performing = Number of girls performing + Number of teachers
Total number of people performing = 13 + 3 = 16

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu and then add that to the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson.

First, we find out how many messages Mr. Yu receives. Since he gets 1/3 as many messages as Ms. Thompson, we calculate:

Messages to Mr. Yu = 1/3 * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = 1/3 * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we add the messages delivered to both teachers to get the total:

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

"To determine how much money David saves, we need to calculate the total cost for both David and Dasha to ride all 9 rides and then find the difference between their costs.

First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha, who buys individual ride tickets:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets.
- Each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs 2 tickets * $2/ticket = $4.
- For 9 rides, Dasha will pay 9 rides * $4/ride = $36.

Now, let's calculate the cost for David, who buys a ride bracelet:
- The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives access to all 9 rides.

The amount David saves is the difference between what Dasha pays and what David pays:
- Dasha's cost: $36
- David's cost: $30
- Savings: $36 - $30 = $6

"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we can start by setting up the ratio and the total number of popsicles in terms of a variable. Let's say the number of popsicles Betty has is 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has is 6x, where x is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles they have together is the sum of Betty's and Sam's popsicles, which is given as 165. So we can write the equation:

5x + 6x = 165

Combining like terms, we get:

11x = 165

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 165 / 11
x = 15

Now that we have the value of x, we can find out how many popsicles each person has:

Betty has 5x popsicles, which is 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6x popsicles, which is 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number Sam has:

90 - 75 = 15

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To determine how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and then subtract that from the cost of the cable package.

1. Netflix costs $10 a month.
2. Hulu and Disney Plus each cost $10 a month, but with a 20% discount for bundling, the cost for each is reduced by 20%.

Let's calculate the discounted cost for Hulu and Disney Plus:

- The discount for each is 20% of $10, which is $10 * 0.20 = $2.
- The discounted cost for each is $10 - $2 = $8.

Now, let's add up the total cost of the streaming services:

- Netflix: $10
- Hulu: $8
- Disney Plus: $8

Total cost of streaming services: $10 + $8 + $8 = $26

Now, we subtract the total cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package to find out how much Tim saves:

- Savings: $60 (cable package) - $26 (streaming services) = $34

So, Tim saves $34 by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services.

"To find the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the time spent recording the song, which is half the time spent writing it.
2. Convert all times to the same unit (minutes in this case).
3. Calculate the total work time.
4. Calculate the percentage of the total work time spent editing.

Step 1: Time spent recording the song
- Writing time: 4 hours
- Recording time: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours

Step 2: Convert all times to minutes
- Writing time: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes
- Recording time: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
- Editing time: 90 minutes (already in minutes)

Step 3: Calculate the total work time
- Total work time = Writing time + Recording time + Editing time
- Total work time = 240 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes
- Total work time = 450 minutes

Step 4: Calculate the percentage of the total work time spent editing
- Percentage spent editing = (Editing time / Total work time) * 100
- Percentage spent editing = (90 / 450) * 100
- Percentage spent editing = 0.2 * 100
- Percentage spent editing = 20%

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to add the cards she initially made, the cards her dad brought, and the cards she received, then subtract the cards she passed out.

She made 20 cards.
Her dad brought 2 boxes of 15 cards each, so that's 2 * 15 = 30 cards.
She received 17 cards from family and friends.

So, the total number of cards she has is 20 (made) + 30 (dad's) + 17 (received) = 67 cards.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so that's 24 + 5 = 29 cards passed out.

Subtracting the cards she passed out from the total number of cards she has gives us 67 - 29 = 38 cards.

Therefore, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies and then determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.

First, we calculate the required amounts:
- Flour: 3 cups per batch * 4 batches = 12 cups
- Milk: 1 cup per batch * 4 batches = 4 cups

Next, we determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk are needed:
- Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so for 12 cups, Mark needs 12 / 2 = 6 bags.
- Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so for 4 cups, Mark needs 4 / 2 = 2 bottles.

Finally, we calculate the difference in the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk:
- Difference: 6 bags - 2 bottles = 4

Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

"To find out how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy usage of the air conditioner before the reduction.
2. Calculate the daily energy usage of the air conditioner after the reduction.
3. Find the difference in daily energy usage to determine the daily savings.
4. Multiply the daily savings by 30 to find the total savings over 30 days.

Step 1: Daily energy usage before reduction
The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. For 8 hours, the usage is:
900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours

Step 2: Daily energy usage after reduction
If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, he will use the air conditioner for 3 hours a day:
900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours

Step 3: Daily savings
The difference in energy usage is the amount saved each day:
7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours

Step 4: Total savings over 30 days
To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000 (since 1 kilowatt-hour = 1000 watt-hours):
4500 watt-hours/day * 30 days = 135000 watt-hours
135000 watt-hours / 1000 = 135 kilowatt-hours

So, Mel will save 135 kilowatt-hours of electric energy in 30 days.

"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we need to add up the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

First, we calculate the total number of stripes:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: 2 * 17 = 34 stripes
- One zebra with 36 stripes: 36 stripes
- One zebra with half as many stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: 36 / 2 = 18 stripes

Now, we add up all the stripes:
34 (from the two zebras) + 36 (from the one zebra) + 18 (from the last zebra) = 88 stripes

Next, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras to find the average:
88 stripes / 4 zebras = 22 stripes per zebra

The average number of stripes on the zebras is 22.

"To determine how much Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required and then multiply by their respective costs.

1. First, we need to find out how many sandwiches are required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people served per sandwich:
   20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

2. Next, we calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed. Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, for 5 sandwiches, we need:
   5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
   5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

3. Now, we calculate the cost of the meat and cheese. The meat costs $7.00 per pound and the cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so:
   5 pounds of meat * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
   5 pounds of cheese * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

4. Finally, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese to find the total cost:
   $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

Therefore, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Allan has 40 cannolis in his house.
2. There is twice as much corn as cannolis, so he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.
3. Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so he now has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.
4. He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he now has, so he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.
5. Adding the corns he bought to the corns he already had, he now has 80 + 60 = 140 corns.
6. The combined total of corns and cannolis is 140 + 100 = 240.

"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 5,000 steps. He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, before his jog, he had completed a total of 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. This means that before his jog, he had 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps completed or in progress.

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we subtract the number of steps he had before his jog from the number of steps he had after his jog:

8,000 (steps after jog) - 6,000 (steps before jog) = 2,000 steps.

Therefore, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

"To determine how many minutes early Toby will be, we need to calculate the total time it will take him to read the book and then subtract that from the time he has before he needs to leave for the airport.

First, we calculate the total number of words in the book:
45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Next, we calculate the time it will take Toby to read the book:
9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, and it takes 10 minutes to get there. So, the total time he needs to account for is the reading time plus the travel time:
30 minutes (reading) + 10 minutes (travel) = 40 minutes

Now, we subtract the total time needed from the time he has:
60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

Toby will be 20 minutes early.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees who continued working in June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Add the total payments for May and June to get the final amount.

Step 1: Total payment for May
- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hours per week: 40
- Pay rate: $15 per hour
- Weeks in May: 4 (assuming a standard 4-week month)

Total payment for May = Number of employees * Hours per week * Pay rate * Weeks in May
Total payment for May = 40 * 40 * $15 * 4

Step 2: Number of employees in June
- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees continued working.
- Number of employees in June = 3/4 * Number of employees in May
- Number of employees in June = 3/4 * 40

Step 3: Total payment for June
- We will use the same hours per week and pay rate for June.
- Weeks in June: 4 (assuming a standard 4-week month)

Total payment for June = Number of employees in June * Hours per week * Pay rate * Weeks in June
Total payment for June = (3/4 * 40) * 40 * $15 * 4

Step 4: Total payment for May and June
Total payment for May and June = Total payment for May + Total payment for June

Now, let's calculate the numbers:

Total payment for May = 40 * 40 * $15 * 4 = 40 * 40 * 60 = 96,000

Number of employees in June = 3/4 * 40 = 30

Total payment for June = 30 * 40 * $15 * 4 = 30 * 40 * 60 = 72,000

Total payment for May and June = 96,000 + 72,000 = 168,000

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:

"To determine how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and subtract that from the $10 her parents gave her.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy:
- The first pound of taffy costs $3.
- The second pound is 1/2 off, so it costs $3 * 1/2 = $1.50.
- The total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, the cost of the mixed bag of seashells is $1.50.

Then, the cost of the 4 magnets:
- Each magnet costs $0.25, so 4 magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashells: $1.50
- Magnets: $1.00
- Total cost: $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Finally, we subtract the total cost from the $10 Sally had:
- Money left: $10 - $7.00 = $3.00

So, Sally has $3.00 left.

"To find out how much Tim spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks after the discount and then add the cost of the finale firework.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the two packages of fireworks before the discount:
- The first package costs $400.
- The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it costs $400 * 2 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages before the discount is:
$400 + $800 = $1200.

Now, let's apply the 20% discount to the two packages:
- A 20% discount means he pays 80% of the total cost.
- The discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is $1200 * 0.20 = $240.
- The cost after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the two packages:
$960 + $150 = $1110.

So, the total amount Tim spent is:
$1110.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the discount amount and then apply it to the regular price of the blouses.

The regular price for each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount on the rack. To find the discount amount for one blouse, we calculate 30% of $20:

Discount amount per blouse = 30% of $20
                           = 0.30 * $20
                           = $6

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to find the discounted price for one blouse:

Discounted price per blouse = Regular price - Discount amount
                            = $20 - $6
                            = $14

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so we multiply the discounted price of one blouse by 4 to find the total cost:

Total cost of the discounted blouses = Discounted price per blouse * Number of blouses
                                    = $14 * 4
                                    = $56

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56.

2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Joanne gathers an unknown number of apples from the average trees, let's call this number \( x \).
4. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
5. Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
6. Joanne's sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.
7. The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500.

We can set up the equation for the total number of apples gathered by both sisters:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

Let \( c \) represent the number of camels and \( d \) represent the number of dromedaries.

From the information given, we have two equations:

1. The total number of heads (each animal has one head):
   \( c + d = 180 \)

2. The total number of humps (camels have 2 humps, dromedaries have 1 hump):
   \( 2c + d = 304 \)

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of \( c \) and \( d \).

First, we can solve the first equation for \( d \):
\( d = 180 - c \)

Next, we substitute \( d \) in the second equation:
\( 2c + (180 - c) = 304 \)

Simplify and solve for \( c \):
\( 2c + 180 - c = 304 \)
\( c = 304 - 180 \)
\( c = 124 \)

Now that we have the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting \( c \) back into the equation for \( d \):
\( d = 180 - 124 \)
\( d = 56 \)

So, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the trip into segments and sum the distances.

1. For the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day:
   4 days * 200 kilometers/day = 800 kilometers

2. Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days:
   30% of 800 kilometers = 0.30 * 800 kilometers = 240 kilometers

3. On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance for that day is:
   0 kilometers

4. During the second week (7 days), he made 300 kilometers every day:
   7 days * 300 kilometers/day = 2100 kilometers

Now, we add up all the distances:
800 kilometers (first 4 days) + 240 kilometers (next 2 days) + 0 kilometers (rest day) + 2100 kilometers (second week) = 3140 kilometers

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:

"To find out how big Timothy's locker is, we can start by determining the size of Zack's locker since we know the size of Peter's locker and the relationship between Zack's and Peter's lockers.

If Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, then Zack's locker is 4 times the size of Peter's locker.

Zack's locker size = 5 cubic inches * 4 = 20 cubic inches

Now, since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, Timothy's locker is twice the size of Zack's locker.

Timothy's locker size = 20 cubic inches * 2 = 40 cubic inches

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.
He initially had $5000 in capital.

So, the total capital he has now is the sum of the initial capital and the amounts from both banks:
$5000 (initial capital) + $4000 (first bank) + $8000 (second bank) = $17000.

"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so a total of 4 * 5 = 20 cats were carried away. This leaves 50 - 20 = 30 cats on the rock. Later, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse, so 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats ran away. Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is 30 - 18 = 12.

"To calculate the total cost of the streaming service for 2 years, we need to break down the costs into the different periods and then sum them up.

1. The first 6 months at the special introductory deal: 6 months * $8/month = $48
2. The next 8 months at the normal price: 8 months * $12/month = $96
3. The remaining time to make up 2 years (24 months) after the first 14 months: 24 months - 14 months = 10 months
4. The cost for the last 10 months at the increased price: 10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, we add up all the costs:
$48 (first 6 months) + $96 (next 8 months) + $140 (last 10 months) = $284

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The tattered jeans cost $28.
2. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so they cost $28 - $6 = $22.
3. Cole saved a total of $6.
4. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, which is 1/3 * $6 = $2.
5. The rest of the savings, which is 2/3 of the total savings, came from the tattered jeans, so that's 2/3 * $6 = $4.

Now, to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we need to determine the original prices of both pairs of jeans before the savings.

6. The tattered jeans were bought for $28 after saving $4, so the original price was $28 + $4 = $32.
7. The jogger jeans were bought for $22 after saving $2, so the original price was $22 + $2 = $24.

Finally, to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we subtract the original price of the tattered jeans from the original price of the jogger jeans:

$24 - $32 = -$8

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost, which implies a positive value. Since the result is negative, it means the tattered jeans originally cost more than the jogger jeans. The correct interpretation of the question would be to find the difference in the original prices, which is $8.

-8

But since the question asks for how much more the jogger jeans cost, and the answer is that they cost less, we should state the positive difference:

"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles rented for the trip.

The capacity of the buses is:
4 buses * 60 employees/bus = 240 employees

The capacity of the minibusses is:
6 minibusses * 30 employees/minibus = 180 employees

The capacity of the minivans is:
10 minivans * 15 employees/minivan = 150 employees

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to get the total number of employees that can join the day trip:
240 employees + 180 employees + 150 employees = 570 employees

"Lillian has built 3 bird feeders and bought 3 others, making a total of 6 bird feeders. The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, which means they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

The total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is 3 feeders * 20 birds per feeder = 60 birds.
The total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders is 3 feeders * 30 birds per feeder = 90 birds.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 60 birds + 90 birds = 150 birds.

"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

The cost of the bagel is $4.

The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup, we calculate 25% of $4 and add it to the original price of the bagel:
25% of $4 = 0.25 * $4 = $1
So, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is:
1/2 * $4 = $2.

Now, we add up the cost of all the items:
$4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to determine how many cards he sold and then calculate the total number of cards, including the ones he kept.

First, we know that Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 in spending cash, which means he has a total of $150 from selling the cards.

The price per card is $1.5, so we can calculate the number of cards he sold by dividing the total amount of money he made by the price per card:

Number of cards sold = Total money made / Price per card
Number of cards sold = $150 / $1.5
Number of cards sold = 100

Since Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, the 100 cards he sold represent the remaining 2/3 of his collection. We can set up the following equation to find the total number of cards (C) he started with:

2/3 * C = 100

To find C, we solve for it:

C = 100 / (2/3)
C = 100 * (3/2)
C = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The caterer was initially told to prepare for 36 guests.
2. Most guests would eat one hot dog, but the caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hot dogs.
3. Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
4. So, the caterer prepared 18 extra hot dogs for the 18 guests who might want a second one.
5. The total number of hot dogs prepared is 36 (one for each guest) + 18 (extra for second hot dogs) = 54 hot dogs.
6. However, 40 guests showed up, and all of them wanted a second hot dog.
7. To satisfy 40 guests with two hot dogs each, the caterer would need 40 * 2 = 80 hot dogs.
8. The caterer only has 54 hot dogs, so the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is the difference between the number of hot dogs needed for a second round and the number of hot dogs available: 40 (guests wanting a second hot dog) - 18 (extra hot dogs prepared) = 22 guests.

22 guests did not get a second hotdog."
"To find the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names, we first need to calculate the number of letters in her sister's name.

Indras has 6 letters in her name. Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than this, so her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we add the number of letters in both names together: 6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13 letters.

"To find out how much Charlotte's order was after the 20% discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.
2. Calculate the discount amount.
3. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to get the final price.

Let's do the math:

1. The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
2. The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
3. The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

The discount is 20% of $165.00, which is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

The final price after the discount is $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

So, Charlotte's order was $132.00.

The cost of the playground ball is $2.

The total cost of these items is:
$6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Dora has saved $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16, so the total amount of money she has is:
$2 + $16 = $18

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many gallons of gas are in one container.
2. Calculate how many gallons 1/4 of a container is.
3. Convert the gallons to pints, knowing that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints.

Step 1: Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5 to find out how many gallons are in one container.
15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Step 2: Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so we calculate 1/4 of 3 gallons.
3 gallons * 1/4 = 0.75 gallons

Step 3: Convert 0.75 gallons to pints.
0.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints

Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, which means he had 1% of $5 left, or $0.05.
2. This means he actually spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95 on chips and candy bars.
3. He bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each, so he spent 3 * $0.40 = $1.20 on chips.
4. The remaining amount he spent on candy bars is $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75.
5. Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is $3.75 / $0.75 = 5.

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

"To find the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide that by the number of servings.

First, let's calculate the cost of the onions:
- The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but Antoine likes to double that amount, so he uses 4 pounds.
- The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the cost for 4 pounds is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock:
- He needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box is on sale for $2.00, so the cost for the beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to get the total cost of the ingredients:
- Total cost = cost of onions + cost of beef stock = $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Finally, we need to find the cost per serving:
- The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is the total cost divided by the number of servings, which is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $2.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater and then calculate how much earlier she needs to leave to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.

1. Wayne's drive time to the theater is 4 minutes.
2. Bernadette's drive time is four times Wayne's, so it is 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.
3. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to account for her longer drive time plus the 5-minute difference.

Wayne's total time to the theater is 4 minutes. Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before that, so she needs to leave 4 + 5 = 9 minutes before Wayne's arrival time.

However, since it takes her 16 minutes to drive, she needs to leave 16 minutes before her arrival time. To find out how much earlier she needs to leave compared to Wayne, we add the 9 minutes to the 16 minutes of drive time:

16 (Bernadette's drive time) + 9 (time to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne) = 25 minutes.

Bernadette should leave 25 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room and the length, so we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

Area = Length × Width

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length to feet because the area is given in square feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so:

Length in feet = 3 yards × 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now we can solve for the width:

360 square feet = 9 feet × Width
Width = 360 square feet / 9 feet
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

Perimeter = 2 × (Length + Width)

Substituting the values we have:

Perimeter = 2 × (9 feet + 40 feet)
Perimeter = 2 × 49 feet
Perimeter = 98 feet

So, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought and then find the difference.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Margareth bought:

- 4 packs of red beads

Each pack contains 20 beads, so we can calculate the total number of beads for each sister as follows:

Elizabeth's total beads:
(1 pack of red + 2 packs of clear) * 20 beads/pack
(1 + 2) * 20
3 * 20
60 beads

Margareth's total beads:
(3 packs of blue + 4 packs of red) * 20 beads/pack
(3 + 4) * 20
7 * 20
140 beads

Now, we find the difference between the number of beads each sister has:

140 beads (Margareth) - 60 beads (Elizabeth) = 80 beads

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon.
   - Swim: 40 minutes
   - Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
   - Run: 50 minutes
   - Total time for Jon: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

2. Next, we calculate the time it took James to complete the swim, which is 10% faster than Jon.
   - 10% of 40 minutes is 4 minutes (10/100 * 40 = 4)
   - James's swim time: 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

3. James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon.
   - James's bike time: 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

4. We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.
   - James's total time: 170 + 10 = 180 minutes

5. Now we can calculate the time it took James to complete the run by subtracting the swim and bike times from his total time.
   - James's run time: 180 - (36 + 85) = 180 - 121 = 59 minutes

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run.

First, we need to convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is:

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so the length of Movie B is:

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so the length of Movie A is:

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

Therefore, Movie A is 20 minutes long.

"First, let's calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the distance the horse runs is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Next, we calculate the amount of hay the horse will eat for running 16 miles. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay needed is:
Hay needed = Distance * Hay per mile
Hay needed = 16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile
Hay needed = 8 bails

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost is:
Total cost = Hay needed * Cost per bail
Total cost = 8 bails * $3/bail
Total cost = $24

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, so the total amount of money he has is:
Total money = Number of bills * Value per bill
Total money = 6 bills * $5/bill
Total money = $30

Finally, we calculate the change Michael will have after buying the hay:
Change = Total money - Total cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

"To calculate the salesman's profit, we need to determine the total revenue from the sales and subtract the cost of the sneakers.

First, we calculate the cost per sneaker:
Cost per sneaker = Total cost / Number of sneakers
Cost per sneaker = $576 / 48
Cost per sneaker = $12

Next, we calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday:
Revenue from flash sale = Number of sneakers sold at flash sale * Price per sneaker at flash sale
Revenue from flash sale = 17 * $20
Revenue from flash sale = $340

Then, we calculate the number of sneakers sold to the department store:
Number of sneakers sold to department store = Total number of sneakers - Number of sneakers sold at flash sale
Number of sneakers sold to department store = 48 - 17
Number of sneakers sold to department store = 31

Now, we calculate the revenue from the department store sales:
Revenue from department store = Number of sneakers sold to department store * Price per sneaker to department store
Revenue from department store = 31 * $25
Revenue from department store = $775

We add the revenues from both sales to get the total revenue:
Total revenue = Revenue from flash sale + Revenue from department store
Total revenue = $340 + $775
Total revenue = $1115

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $1115 - $576
Profit = $539

The salesman's profit is $539."

"Let's break down the costs and savings to find the regular price of the popcorn.

If you buy the super ticket, the cost is $20, and you get one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra, making the total $21.

If you buy a regular movie ticket, the cost is $12. The soda costs $3, and we need to find the cost of the popcorn, which we'll call P.

The total cost with a regular ticket, popcorn, and soda is $12 + $3 + P.

You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, so the cost of the regular ticket, popcorn, and soda should be $2 less than the super ticket cost of $21.

So, we have the equation:

$12 + $3 + P = $21 - $2

Now, let's solve for P:

$15 + P = $19
P = $19 - $15
P = $4

The regular price of the popcorn is $4.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the original cost of filling one helium balloon. We can do this by dividing the total cost by the number of balloons filled on the first day.

Original cost per balloon = Total cost / Number of balloons
Original cost per balloon = $900 / 20
Original cost per balloon = $45

After the price increase, the new cost per balloon is the original cost plus the increase.

New cost per balloon = Original cost per balloon + Price increase
New cost per balloon = $45 + $20
New cost per balloon = $65

Now, we can calculate how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price.

Total cost for 170 balloons = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
Total cost for 170 balloons = $65 * 170
Total cost for 170 balloons = $11,050

"To find out how much the potting soil will cost Bob, we need to calculate the total volume of soil required and then determine the cost based on the volume of soil each bag can hold and the price per bag.

First, we calculate the volume of one raised bed:
Volume of one raised bed = width * length * height
Volume of one raised bed = 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet
Volume of one raised bed = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
Total volume of soil = volume of one raised bed * number of beds
Total volume of soil = 32 cubic feet * 10
Total volume of soil = 320 cubic feet

Next, we determine how many bags of potting soil Bob will need:
Number of bags = total volume of soil / volume per bag
Number of bags = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet per bag
Number of bags = 160 bags

Finally, we calculate the total cost:
Total cost = number of bags * cost per bag
Total cost = 160 bags * $12 per bag

1. Calculate the number of green cards:
60% of 15 red cards is 0.60 * 15 = 9.
So, the number of green cards is 15 (red cards) + 9 = 24.

2. Calculate the number of yellow cards:
The number of yellow cards is the sum of the red and green cards, which is 15 (red) + 24 (green) = 39.

"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of puppies.
2. Calculate the total number of puppies with spots.
3. Divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies.
4. Multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage.

Let's do the math:

1. Total number of puppies = Jennifer's puppies + Brandon's puppies
   Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

2. Total number of puppies with spots = Jennifer's spotted puppies + Brandon's spotted puppies
   Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

3. Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) * 100
   Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100

4. Calculate the percentage:
   Percentage of puppies with spots = 0.35 * 100 = 35%

"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then divide the total weight by the truck's capacity.

1. Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
2. Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
3. Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
4. Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:

Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)
Total weight = 4500 pounds

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, so we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find out how many trips are needed:

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip
Number of trips = 2

Since the number of trips is a whole number, the farmer will need exactly 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many plants Toni has.
2. Use the number of plants Toni has to find out how many plants Shondra has.

First, we know that Frederick has 10 plants. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. To find out how many plants Toni has, we calculate 60% of Frederick's plants and add that to the number of plants Frederick has:

60% of 10 plants = 0.60 * 10 = 6 plants

So, Toni has 10 plants + 6 plants = 16 plants.

Now, Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So we subtract 7 from the number of plants Toni has:

16 plants - 7 plants = 9 plants

Shondra has 9 plants.

"First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has:

6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 basketball cards

Next, we'll calculate the total number of baseball cards:

5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 baseball cards

Now, we'll add the basketball and baseball cards to find the total number of cards:

150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 cards

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so we subtract those from the total:

350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards

These 300 cards are the ones she gives to her students. If each student gets 10 cards, we can find the number of students by dividing the number of cards given away by the number of cards each student receives:

300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for both Becky and Kelly, taking into account the discounts they received, and then find the difference between the two amounts.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Becky:
- Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each.
- The total cost before the discount is 20 * 45 cents = 900 cents or $9.00.
- Becky received a $1 discount, so the final cost for Becky is $9.00 - $1.00 = $8.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for Kelly:
- Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each.
- The total cost before the discount is 20 * 50 cents = 1000 cents or $10.00.
- Kelly received a 10 percent discount, so the discount amount is 10% of $10.00, which is $1.00.
- The final cost for Kelly is $10.00 - $1.00 = $9.00.

Now, we find the difference between what Kelly paid and what Becky paid:
- Kelly paid $9.00 and Becky paid $8.00.
- The difference is $9.00 - $8.00 = $1.00.

So, Kelly paid $1.00 more than Becky.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Frank starts with 200 shoes.
2. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since a pair is 2 shoes, he gets 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
3. On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
4. On Friday, he gains 30 pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.
5. On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of shoes he will have on Sunday:

Starting shoes: 200
Shoes after Monday: 200 + 10 = 210
Shoes after Wednesday: 210 + 30 = 240
Shoes after Friday: 240 + 60 = 300
Shoes after Saturday: 300 - 180 = 120

So, on Sunday, Frank will have 120 shoes.

"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pencils at the start of the year.
2. Determine how many pencils were used after two months.
3. Calculate the number of pencils remaining after two months.
4. Determine how many pencils were left at the end of the year.

Step 1: Total number of pencils at the start of the year
There are 30 students, and each started with 10 pencils.
Total pencils = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils

Step 2: Pencils used after two months
1/5 of the total pencils were used.
Pencils used = 1/5 * 300 pencils = 60 pencils

Step 3: Pencils remaining after two months
Pencils remaining = Total pencils - Pencils used
Pencils remaining = 300 pencils - 60 pencils = 240 pencils

Step 4: Pencils left at the end of the year
1/3 of the remaining pencils were left at the end of the year.
Pencils left = 1/3 * 240 pencils = 80 pencils

So, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is 80.

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( c \).

According to the rules set by Matt's dad:
- Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, which is \( \frac{1}{2}c \).
- He also gets two extra cookies for cleaning his room.

So the total number of cookies Matt can have is \( \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \).

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, so we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}c + 2 = 5 \]

Now, we solve for \( c \):
\[ \frac{1}{2}c = 5 - 2 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}c = 3 \]
\[ c = 3 \times 2 \]
\[ c = 6 \]

Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have five cookies in total.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the shark's length to inches, since the remoras' lengths are given in inches.
2. Calculate the combined length of the two remoras.
3. Divide the combined length of the remoras by the shark's length in inches.
4. Multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage.

Let's do the calculations:

1. The shark is 10 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the shark's length in inches is:
   10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches

2. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length is:
   2 remoras * 6 inches/remora = 12 inches

3. The ratio of the combined length of the remoras to the shark's length is:
   12 inches / 120 inches = 0.1

4. To convert this ratio to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
   0.1 * 100 = 10%

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To find out how many kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

First, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts:

9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) = 15

However, this sum counts the kids who are allergic to both dairy and peanuts twice, so we need to subtract the number of kids who are allergic to both:

15 - 3 (both) = 12

This means that 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. Now, to find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class:

32 (total kids) - 12 (allergic to dairy or peanuts) = 20

So, 20 kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything.

"Heather buys 2 packs of razors, but because of the ""buy one get one free"" sale, she actually gets 4 packs of razors. Each pack contains 4 razors, so she gets a total of 16 razors.

The cost for 2 packs (which is the amount she pays for) is $4.00 per pack, so the total cost before the coupon is $4.00 * 2 = $8.00.

She has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost after the coupon is $8.00 - $2.00 = $6.00.

To find the cost per individual razor, we divide the total cost by the number of razors: $6.00 / 16 razors = $0.375 per razor.

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.375 to cents by multiplying by 100: 0.375 * 100 = 37.5 cents.

Since we typically don't deal with half cents, we round to the nearest cent, which is 38 cents.

"To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation where the total cost of the first venue equals the total cost of the second venue.

Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 per person for food. So the total cost for the first venue is:
\[ 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per person, which includes food. So the total cost for the second venue is:
\[ 25x \]

We set these two costs equal to each other to find the number of guests where the costs are the same:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"Let's denote the number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi as L, D, and B, respectively.

According to the problem, we have the following equations:

1. L + D + B = 43 (the total number of insects collected)
2. L = D + 7 (Lily found 7 more than David)
3. D = B / 2 (David found half of what Bodhi found)

From equation 3, we can express B in terms of D:

B = 2D

Now we can substitute L and B from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1:

(D + 7) + D + (2D) = 43

Combine like terms:

4D + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

4D = 36

Divide by 4:

D = 9

Now that we know D, we can find L using equation 2:

L = D + 7
L = 9 + 7
L = 16

Lily found 16 insects.

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of the skein they each used and then multiply by the total number of yards in a skein.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 4 in this case.

1/4 (Mariah's portion) + 2/4 (Grandma's portion, since 1/2 is equivalent to 2/4) = 3/4 (total portion used)

Now, we multiply the total portion used by the number of yards in a skein:

3/4 * 364 yards = 273 yards

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"To find out how many gifts Cherrie bought in total, we need to calculate the number of gifts for the 2 friends who want 5 gifts each, the number of gifts for the 3 friends who want 2 gifts each, and then add the 10 random gifts she decided to buy.

For the 2 friends who want 5 gifts each:
2 friends * 5 gifts/friend = 10 gifts

For the 3 friends who want 2 gifts each:
3 friends * 2 gifts/friend = 6 gifts

Adding the 10 random gifts:
10 random gifts

Now, we add all the gifts together:
10 gifts (for the 2 friends) + 6 gifts (for the 3 friends) + 10 random gifts = 26 gifts

So, Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts.

"To find the length of the couch, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. The chair is 3 feet wide.
2. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so the rug is 3 + 5 = 8 feet wide.
3. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug, so the couch is 2 * 8 + 2 = 18 feet long.

The couch is 18 feet long."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.
- 2 of these packs were strawberry flavored.
- 1 pack was grape flavored, which cost $2.
- 1 pack was green apple flavored, which cost half as much as the grape pack, so it cost $1.

The total cost of the gum was $7. We can set up an equation to find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum. Let's call the cost of each pack of strawberry gum ""S"".

The total cost can be represented as:
2S (for the strawberry packs) + $2 (for the grape pack) + $1 (for the green apple pack) = $7

Now we can solve for S:
2S + $2 + $1 = $7
2S + $3 = $7
2S = $7 - $3
2S = $4
S = $4 / 2
S = $2

Each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the number of sticks he can get from each type of wood and then figure out the best combination within his budget.

First, let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

- A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks.
  Cost per stick from 2 x 4 = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

- A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks.
  Cost per stick from 2 x 8 = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood provides a lower cost per stick, it is the cheaper option. However, the question asks for the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber, which in this case is the 2 x 4 piece of wood.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces of wood he can buy with $24:

- Number of 2 x 4 pieces he can buy = $24 / $4 per piece = 6 pieces

Since each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make from 6 pieces is:

- Total sticks from 2 x 4 = 6 pieces * 200 sticks per piece = 1200 sticks

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber (2 x 4) is:

"To calculate the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Calculate the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair.

Step 1: Total number of legs
Each dog has 4 legs, and Mario has 6 dogs.
Total legs = 4 legs/dog * 6 dogs = 24 legs

Step 2: Number of pairs of snowshoes
Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the number of pairs.
Number of pairs = 24 legs / 2 legs/pair = 12 pairs

Step 3: Total cost
Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
Total cost = 12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00

Therefore, it will cost Mario $144.00 to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs.

"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the bus trips without the pass:
- Janet takes 2 bus trips per day.
- Each bus trip costs $2.20.
- She takes these trips 5 days a week.

Total cost per week without the pass:
2 trips/day * $2.20/trip * 5 days/week = $22.00/week

Now, let's subtract the cost of the weekly bus pass from the total cost without the pass to find the savings:
$22.00/week - $20.00/week = $2.00/week

So, Janet would save $2.00 per week by buying a weekly bus pass.

4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals:

- Farm animals: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
- Zoo animals: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Combined, the farm and zoo have:

"To calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to reach his goal, we first need to determine the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th, and then calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.

1. Calculate the total number of days:
- From January 1st to July 19th (since today is December 31st, we start counting from the next day, January 1st):
- January has 31 days, but we start on the 1st, so we count 31 days.
- February has 28 days in a non-leap year and 29 days in a leap year.
- March has 31 days.
- April has 30 days.
- May has 31 days.
- June has 30 days.
- July has 19 days up to the 19th.

Let's add these up to find the total number of days:

31 (January) + 28 (February, assuming it's not a leap year) + 31 (March) + 30 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 19 (July) = 200 days

2. Calculate the total number of calories to lose 30 lbs:
- 30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories

3. Calculate the daily calorie deficit:
- 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories/day

So, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to reach his goal by July 19th.

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write that as:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write that as:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second one:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Now we solve for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by multiplying the cost of the lot by 3:
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So the house cost $90,000.

"To calculate Tara's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the canvas bags.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

Step 1: Total cost of the canvas bags
Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags, so she bought a total of 8 * 5 = 40 canvas bags.
Each bag cost her $4, so the total cost is 40 * $4 = $160.

Step 2: Total revenue from selling the canvas bags
She sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue is 40 * $8 = $320.

Step 3: Calculate the profit
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $320 - $160 = $160

Tara's profit from selling the canvas bags is $160.

"Let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C_O \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has, and \( S_O \) be the number of sofas Ophelia has. According to the problem, Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so we can write:

\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]

We are also told that Ophelia has 20 sofas, so:

\[ S_O = 20 \]

Substituting the value of \( S_O \) into the first equation, we get:

\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]

Solving for \( C_O \), we find:

\[ C_O = 20 + 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Now, let's consider Jenna. Let \( C_J \) be the number of chairs Jenna has, and \( S_J \) be the number of sofas Jenna has. We know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so:

\[ C_J = 3 \times C_O \]
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]

Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so:

\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]

Now we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together:

Total sofas = \( S_O + S_J \)
Total sofas = \( 20 + 64 \)
Total sofas = \( 84 \)

Total chairs = \( C_O + C_J \)
Total chairs = \( 22 + 66 \)
Total chairs = \( 88 \)

Total number of sofas and chairs = Total sofas + Total chairs
Total number of sofas and chairs = \( 84 + 88 \)
Total number of sofas and chairs = \( 172 \)

Next, we account for the two weeks where he worked out 5 hours each:
5 hours/week * 2 weeks = 10 hours

Then, we account for the one week where he worked out 6 hours:
6 hours * 1 week = 6 hours

Since these three variations (10 hours + 6 hours) are in place of the regular 4-hour workouts for 3 of the 8 weeks, we need to subtract the regular workout time for those 3 weeks and add the actual time spent:
(5 hours * 2 weeks) + (6 hours * 1 week) - (4 hours * 3 weeks) = 10 hours + 6 hours - 12 hours = 4 hours

"To find the cost of one monitor, we can start by determining the cost of the printer. Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost:

$1,100 - $400 = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, the printer, and the two monitors is $2,400. We can set up an equation to find the cost of the two monitors:

Cost of computer + Cost of printer + 2 * Cost of one monitor = Total cost
$1,100 + $700 + 2 * Cost of one monitor = $2,400

Now, we can solve for the cost of one monitor:

2 * Cost of one monitor = $2,400 - ($1,100 + $700)
2 * Cost of one monitor = $2,400 - $1,800
2 * Cost of one monitor = $600

Divide both sides by 2 to find the cost of one monitor:

Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

So, one monitor cost $300.

   10 boys * 60 shells/boy = 600 shells

3. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys (600 shells) plus four times as many seashells as the boys (4 * 600 shells). So the total number of shells brought by the girls is:
   600 shells + 4 * 600 shells = 600 shells + 2400 shells = 3000 shells

4. Since there are 10 girls, the number of shells brought by each girl is:
   3000 shells / 10 girls = 300 shells/girl

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to add the thickness of each book together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 mm = 62 mm thick.

Now, we add the thickness of all four books together:

"To calculate the total amount you need to pay, you first need to calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill and then add that to the original bill. After that, since the bill is being split evenly, you would take half of the total (including the tip) and that would be your share.

Here's the calculation:

1. Calculate the tip: $50 * 20% = $50 * 0.20 = $10
2. Add the tip to the original bill: $50 + $10 = $60
3. Split the total bill evenly: $60 / 2 = $30

So, you end up paying $30.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The total amount of money is $18, which is shared equally among 3 boys.
2. Each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.
3. The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, so he has $6 + $5 = $11.
4. The following day, he adds another $10, so he has $11 + $10 = $21.
5. He then spends $8, so he has $21 - $8 = $13 left.
6. He triples the amount he has left, so he has $13 * 3 = $39.

The eldest boy now has $39.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125, given that he saves twice as much daily in the second half as in the first half.

April has 30 days, so the first half of the month consists of 15 days, and the second half also consists of 15 days.

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of the month as \( x \). Therefore, in the second half of the month, he saves \( 2x \) each day.

The total savings for the month can be expressed as:
\[ 15x + 15(2x) = 1125 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Since \( x \) is the amount saved each day in the first half, the amount saved each day in the second half is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of the month.

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find out how much Brad gets, we divide both sides by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} \]
\[ B = 20 \]

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we can calculate Jeff's amount as:

The cost of two pens is:
2 pens * $0.25/pen = $0.50

The cost of one calculator is:
1 calculator * $12.00/calculator = $12.00

The cost of one geometry set is:
1 geometry set * $10.00/geometry set = $10.00

The total cost before the discount is:
$7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

Now, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

For the sales over $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, she earns an additional 10% commission:
$1500 * 10% = $1500 * 0.10 = $150

Now, we add both parts of her commission to find her total earnings:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Ray takes to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water, and then find the difference between the two times.

First, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim 1 mile in warm water:
- In cold water, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
- In warm water, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water.

So, the time to swim 1 mile in warm water is:
2 * 16 minutes (twice as long) + 2 minutes (2 minutes more) = 32 minutes + 2 minutes = 34 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time to swim 3 miles:
- In cold water, 3 miles would take 3 * 16 minutes = 48 minutes.
- In warm water, 3 miles would take 3 * 34 minutes = 102 minutes.

Finally, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and in cold water:
102 minutes (warm water) - 48 minutes (cold water) = 54 minutes.

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day.

"To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we first need to determine the weight of each person.

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds.

Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so:

Susan's weight = 150 pounds - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 130 pounds

Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, so:
Bob's weight = 2 * Susan's weight
Bob's weight = 2 * 130 pounds
Bob's weight = 260 pounds

Now, to find the average weight, we add the weights of all three friends and divide by the number of friends:

Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3
Average weight = (150 pounds + 130 pounds + 260 pounds) / 3
Average weight = 540 pounds / 3
Average weight = 180 pounds

Area = length × width
Area = 18 feet × 12 feet
Area = 216 square feet

Now, let's calculate each of the costs:

1. Cost of the new carpet:
Cost of carpet = cost per square foot × area
Cost of carpet = $12/sq ft × 216 sq ft
Cost of carpet = $2,592

2. Cost of the padding:
Cost of padding = cost per square foot × area
Cost of padding = $2/sq ft × 216 sq ft
Cost of padding = $432

3. Cost to remove the old carpet:
Cost of removal = cost per square foot × area
Cost of removal = $4/sq ft × 216 sq ft
Cost of removal = $864

4. Cost to install the new carpet:
Cost of installation = cost per square foot × area
Cost of installation = $34/sq ft × 216 sq ft
Cost of installation = $7,344

50 (days one and two) + 0 (day three) + 120 (days four and five) + 20 (day six) + 90 (day seven) = 280 birds

Now, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days (7) to find the average:
280 birds / 7 days = 40 birds per day

"To solve the problem, we need to follow the steps as described:

1. Start with the initial value, which is 20.
2. Add half of the initial value to itself.
3. Divide the result by 5.
4. Subtract 12 from the initial value.
5. Multiply the result from step 3 by the result from step 4.

Let's calculate it step by step:

1. Initial value: 20
2. Half of the initial value: 20 / 2 = 10
3. Initial value plus half the initial value: 20 + 10 = 30
4. Divide the result by 5: 30 / 5 = 6
5. Initial value minus 12: 20 - 12 = 8
6. Multiply the result from step 4 by the result from step 5: 6 * 8 = 48

The final value of the number train is 48.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then apply that percentage to the desired temperature of 520 degrees.

First, let's find the percentage increase from the set temperature to the actual temperature when the oven is set to 450 degrees.

The actual temperature is 468 degrees, and the set temperature is 450 degrees. The difference is:

468 - 450 = 18 degrees

The percentage increase is:

(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Now, we need to find the temperature to set the oven to so that it will actually reach 520 degrees, taking into account the 4% increase.

Let x be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be x plus 4% of x:

x + 0.04x = 520

1.04x = 520

Now, we solve for x:

x = 520 / 1.04
x = 500

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the first movie is:
1 hour * 60 minutes/hour + 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. So, the second movie is:
2 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the duration of both movies together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract that from Herb's house value.

30% of $76,000 is:
0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800

So, Juan's house is worth:
$76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

The combined value of the two houses is:
$76,000 (Herb's house) + $53,200 (Juan's house) = $129,200

$129,200"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.
2. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.
3. Judy's friend brought 40 cups to the event.
4. Judy's friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so the friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend:

- Judy's utensils: 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36 utensils
- Friend's utensils: 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84 utensils

Adding both together, we get the total number of utensils:

36 (Judy's utensils) + 84 (Friend's utensils) = 120 utensils

"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost for 2 boxes of contacts with the 10% discount.
2. Determine the total number of contacts Pete will get from 2 boxes.
3. Divide the total cost by the total number of contacts to find the cost per contact.

Let's do the math:

1. The cost of 1 box of contacts is $100.00. With a 10% discount, the cost of 1 box is:
   $100.00 - ($100.00 * 0.10) = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

   Therefore, the cost of 2 boxes is:
   $90.00 * 2 = $180.00

2. Each box contains 90 contacts, so 2 boxes will contain:
   90 contacts/box * 2 boxes = 180 contacts

3. The cost per contact is:
   $180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00/contact

Since contacts are typically used in pairs, we need to find the cost per pair:

   $1.00/contact * 2 contacts/pair = $2.00/pair

The cost per pair of contacts is $2.00.

"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate the total hours each of them worked and then multiply by the hourly rate to find their earnings.

Jill's hours:
- Saturday: 2 hours
- Sunday: 1 hour
Total hours for Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

John's hours:
- Saturday: 2 times Jill's Saturday hours = 2 * 2 = 4 hours
- Sunday: 3 times Jill's Sunday hours = 3 * 1 = 3 hours
Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Now, we calculate their earnings:
- Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30
- John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

The difference in their earnings:
- John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

John earned $40 more than Jill.

"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total number of calories she burns during her exercise.

Hannah burns 500 calories per hour doing aerobics. Since she does aerobics for 2 hours, the total calories burned from aerobics is:
500 calories/hour * 2 hours = 1000 calories

Hannah also burns 600 calories per hour running. Since she runs for 1 hour, the total calories burned from running is:
600 calories/hour * 1 hour = 600 calories

The total calories burned from both activities is:
1000 calories (aerobics) + 600 calories (running) = 1600 calories

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned. To find out how much water she needs to drink, we divide the total calories burned by 200 and then multiply by 100 ml:

(1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml = 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( R \) as the number of red jelly beans,
- \( B \) as the number of blue jelly beans,
- \( G \) as the number of green jelly beans.

From the note, we have the following relationships:
1. \( R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \) (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans)
2. \( G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \) (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans)

We also know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500:
3. \( R + B + G = 4500 \)

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) from equations 1 and 2 into equation 3, we get:
\( 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \)

Combining like terms, we have:
\( 3B = 4500 \)

Dividing both sides by 3, we find:
\( B = 1500 \)

Now we can find \( R \) and \( G \):
\( R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
\( G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract \( R \) from \( G \):
\( G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \)

So, there are 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"To find the average of the three typing speed measurements, we need to add them together and then divide by the number of measurements.

Jared's initial typing speed: 47 WPM
After some lessons: 52 WPM
After further increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now we add the three measurements together:
47 WPM + 52 WPM + 57 WPM = 156 WPM

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of measurements, which is 3:
156 WPM / 3 = 52 WPM

The average of the three measurements is 52 WPM.

If Martin eats donuts every day for 5 weeks, he will gain:
1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

The difference in weight between the two options at the end of 5 weeks is:
8.75 pounds (gained from donuts) - (-6.25 pounds) (lost from Cheerios) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds

3. Alex also calls 10 of her friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 additional people.

Now, let's add up all the people:

- 100 (initial invitees) + 200 (friends of initial invitees) + 10 (Alex's friends) + 8 (spouses of Alex's friends) = 318 people.

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats.

"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to calculate the height of the beanstalk each day until it exceeds 20 feet.

The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall and doubles in height every day. We can represent the height of the beanstalk on day n as:

Height on day n = Initial height * 2^(n-1)

Where n is the number of days since planting. We want to find the smallest n such that the height is greater than 20 feet.

Let's calculate:

Day 1: 4 * 2^(1-1) = 4 * 2^0 = 4 * 1 = 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2^(2-1) = 4 * 2^1 = 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 4 * 2^(3-1) = 4 * 2^2 = 4 * 4 = 16 feet
Day 4: 4 * 2^(4-1) = 4 * 2^3 = 4 * 8 = 32 feet

On day 4, the beanstalk is 32 feet tall, which is the first time it exceeds the 20 feet height of Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Multiply that by the number of days in a week to get the weekly protein intake.

Step 1: Since 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein, 200 grams will contain twice as much protein. So, 200 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams * 2 = 6 grams of protein.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so if John eats 6 grams of protein from mushrooms each day, in a week he will consume 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein.

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, the second angle is twice the smallest angle, which is \( 2x \) degrees, and the third angle is three times the smallest angle, which is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} \]
\[ x = 30 \]

The largest angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

- Dimes: 6 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels * 5 cents/nickel = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies * 1 cent/penny = 15 cents

Now, we add up the total amount of money in cents:
200 cents (from quarters) + 60 cents (from dimes) + 70 cents (from nickels) + 15 cents (from pennies) = 345 cents

Finally, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Next, we calculate the number of rotations for 400 miles:
362.5 rotations per mile * 400 miles = 145,000 rotations per month

Now, we need to find out how many months it will take to reach 10,440,000 rotations:
10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations per month = 72 months

"To find out how much each pump of shampoo costs, we need to first determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from the bottle if she uses 1 pump per wash. Since the bottle gives 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash, doubling the number of washes will give us the total number of washes with 1 pump per wash.

120 washes * 2 = 240 washes

Now, we need to find the cost per pump. The jumbo bottle costs $24.00, and there are 240 washes (or pumps) in the bottle.

$24.00 / 240 pumps = $0.10 per pump

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents by multiplying by 100.

"To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items after the 30% discount and then subtract that from the $50 he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:
- The shirt costs $25.
- The shorts cost $35.
- The total cost before the discount is $25 + $35 = $60.

Next, we apply the 30% discount to the total cost:
- The discount amount is 30% of $60, which is 0.30 * $60 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost:
- The final cost after the discount is $60 - $18 = $42.

Finally, we subtract the final cost from the amount of money Joe has to find out how much he will have left:
- Joe has $50, so the amount left after the purchase is $50 - $42 = $8.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the additional months.

For the first 5 months, the cost is straightforward:
5 months * $100,000 / 5 months = $100,000

The research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so the total duration of the research is:
5 months * 10 = 50 months

The additional months of research are:
50 months - 5 months = 45 months

The cost per month for the additional 45 months is 50% more than the initial monthly cost. The initial monthly cost is $100,000 / 5 months = $20,000 per month. Therefore, the increased monthly cost is:
$20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month

The cost for the additional 45 months is:
45 months * $30,000 per month = $1,350,000

The total cost of the research is the sum of the initial 5 months and the additional 45 months:
$100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000

The total cost of John's research is:

"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of loads Gary does in a week.
2. Calculate the number of loads Gary does in a year.
3. Calculate the total amount of water used in a year.
4. Calculate the total cost of the water used in a year.

Step 1: Number of loads per week
Gary does laundry twice a week, so he does 2 loads per week.

Step 2: Number of loads per year
There are 52 weeks in a year, so the number of loads per year is:
2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads/year

Step 3: Total amount of water used per year
Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used per year is:
104 loads/year * 20 gallons/load = 2080 gallons/year

Step 4: Total cost of water used per year
A gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost of water used per year is:
2080 gallons/year * $0.15/gallon = $312/year

Therefore, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year.

"To find out how much Scarlett spent, we need to add up the cost of all the items she bought.

The cost of the aquarium is $10.00.
The cost of the 2 bags of rocks is 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.
The cost of the 3 pieces of coral is 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.
The cost of the 20 fish is 20 * $0.50 = $10.00.
The cost of the fish food is $2.00.

Now, we add all these costs together:

$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00.

"Jim starts with a 20-pack of gum.

He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, which adds 1 + 1 = 2 pieces of gum.

So, during the day, he chews a total of 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum.

Starting with 20 pieces, after chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces of gum left.

He then gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces of gum.

Therefore, at the end of the day, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb per second to kb per hour.
2. Convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour.

Step 1: Convert kb per second to kb per hour.
There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.
Ashley's speed is 20 kb per second, so in one hour, she can download:
20 kb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72000 kb/hour

Step 2: Convert kb per hour to Mb per hour.
Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we divide the total kb per hour by 1000 to get Mb per hour.
72000 kb/hour / 1000 kb/Mb = 72 Mb/hour

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:
72 Mb/hour

"To calculate the total number of cars towed in the week, we can break it down as follows:

- For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So for three days, it would be 10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars.
- For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than 10 each day, which is 10 cars - 4 cars = 6 cars/day. So for four days, it would be 6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars.

Adding the cars towed in the first three days to the cars towed in the last four days gives us the total for the week:

30 cars (first three days) + 24 cars (last four days) = 54 cars.

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height and Adam's current height, and then divide that by the rate at which he grows each year.

The required height to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the required height in inches is:
4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Adam's current height is 40 inches. The difference between the required height and Adam's current height is:
48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches

Adam grows 2 inches a year, so the number of years it will take for him to grow the additional 8 inches is:
8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To calculate how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sales amount for the 10 cars.
2. Calculate the total cost the company paid to acquire the 10 cars.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total sales amount.
4. Calculate James' commission, which is 10% of the profit.

Let's do the math:

1. Total sales amount for 10 cars: 10 cars * $25,000 per car = $250,000
2. Total cost to acquire 10 cars: 30% of $250,000 = 0.30 * $250,000 = $75,000
3. Profit: Total sales amount - Total cost to acquire = $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000
4. James' commission: 10% of $175,000 = 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500

25% of 100 riders can stay upright, so:
0.25 * 100 = 25 riders

Step 2: Number of women who can stay upright
60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, so:
0.60 * 25 = 15 women

Step 3: Number of men who can stay upright
Subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:
25 - 15 = 10 men

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The price of a diamond jewel is given as $2000.
2. The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. So, the price of a gold jewel is:
   \( \text{Price of Gold Jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times \text{Price of Diamond Jewel} \)
   \( \text{Price of Gold Jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 \)
   \( \text{Price of Gold Jewel} = 1600 \)

3. The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. So, the price of a silver jewel is:
   \( \text{Price of Silver Jewel} = \text{Price of Gold Jewel} - 400 \)
   \( \text{Price of Silver Jewel} = 1600 - 400 \)
   \( \text{Price of Silver Jewel} = 1200 \)

4. The total price for all three jewels is the sum of the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:
   \( \text{Total Price} = \text{Price of Diamond Jewel} + \text{Price of Gold Jewel} + \text{Price of Silver Jewel} \)
   \( \text{Total Price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 \)

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, we find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. Since Tom is driving at 70 mph and Bob is driving at 55 mph, Tom is gaining on Bob at a rate of:

70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

This means Tom is closing the gap by 15 miles every hour. To find out how long it will take to close a 75-mile gap, we divide the distance by the relative speed:

75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if he misses some. The total cost of the classes is $60, and there are 10 classes in total.

If Manny misses a class, the cost per class for the attended classes will increase. We need to find the point at which the cost per class exceeds $10.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). The number of classes he attends will then be \( 10 - x \). The cost per class when he misses \( x \) classes is \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the maximum \( x \) such that \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \).

Solving the inequality:

\[
\frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
\]

\[
60 \leq 10(10 - x)
\]

\[
60 \leq 100 - 10x
\]

\[
10x \leq 40
\]

\[
x \leq 4
\]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes and the cost per class will still be $10 or less. If he misses 5 or more classes, the cost per class will exceed $10, and his parents won't sign him up again.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we need to calculate the number of customers each of them processes daily and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

Jewel processes 50 customers daily. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers daily.

Together, they process 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers daily.

Since they work all days of the week, we multiply the daily total by 7 (the number of days in a week):

150 customers/day * 7 days/week = 1050 customers/week.

2. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.
3. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so if we let L represent the number of miles Lynn ran, then Reggie ran L + 3 miles.

Since we know Reggie ran 20 miles, we can set up the equation:

L + 3 = 20

Now, we solve for L:

L = 20 - 3
L = 17

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to calculate the cost of one apple and one orange first, and then multiply those by the quantities Clyde is buying.

The cost of one apple is:
$5.20 / 4 apples = $1.30 per apple

The cost of one orange is:
$3.30 / 3 oranges = $1.10 per orange

Now, we calculate the cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
5 apples * $1.30 per apple = $6.50
5 oranges * $1.10 per orange = $5.50

The total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is:

"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to calculate the volume of the hole and then multiply that by the time it takes him to shovel a cubic foot of earth.

The volume of the hole is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and depth:

Volume = Length × Width × Depth
Volume = 6 feet × 4 feet × 3 feet
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Now, if it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, the total time to dig the hole is:

Total time = Volume × Time per cubic foot
Total time = 72 cubic feet × 3 seconds/cubic foot
Total time = 216 seconds

To convert the time into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

Total time in minutes = 216 seconds ÷ 60 seconds/minute
Total time in minutes = 3.6 minutes

However, since the question asks for the final numerical answer and it is typically expected in the base unit used in the calculation (seconds in this case), we will provide the answer in seconds.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500
6. Towing package: The cost of the towing package is not specified, so we will assume it is included in the ""several added features"" and needs to be accounted for. However, since the cost is not provided, we cannot include it in the calculation without additional information.

"To calculate Tim's new annual salary after the promotion, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new monthly salary after the 5% raise.
2. Calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary based on the new salary.
3. Calculate the total annual salary, which is the sum of the 12 months of the new salary plus the bonus.

Step 1: New monthly salary after 5% raise
New monthly salary = Original monthly salary + (5% of original monthly salary)
New monthly salary = $20,000 + (0.05 * $20,000)
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000
New monthly salary = $21,000

Step 2: Calculate the bonus
Bonus = 0.5 * New monthly salary
Bonus = 0.5 * $21,000
Bonus = $10,500

Step 3: Calculate the total annual salary
Total annual salary = (New monthly salary * 12) + Bonus
Total annual salary = ($21,000 * 12) + $10,500
Total annual salary = $252,000 + $10,500
Total annual salary = $262,500

So, Tim will make $262,500 in a year.

"To find the total cost of everything James bought, we need to calculate the cost of the suits, the dress pants, and the dress shirts, and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the suits:
10 suits * $750/suit = $7500

2. The cost of the dress pants:
The cost of one pair of dress pants is 1/5 the cost of a suit, so:
$750 / 5 = $150 per pair of dress pants
10 pairs of dress pants * $150/pair = $1500

3. The cost of the dress shirts:
He buys 3 dress shirts per suit, so he buys:
10 suits * 3 shirts/suit = 30 dress shirts
30 dress shirts * $60/shirt = $1800

"To find out how many miles Alisa and Stanley biked in total, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add those distances together.

The formula to calculate distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Alisa:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 12 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4.5 \, \text{hours} \]

For Stanley:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2.5 \, \text{hours} \]

Now we calculate each distance:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 12 \times 4.5 = 54 \, \text{miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 10 \times 2.5 = 25 \, \text{miles} \]

To find the total distance they biked, we add the two distances together:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} + \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} \]

"To calculate the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to determine the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, and then add these times together.

First, we calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill can dig 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.
- Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet per hour = 6 hours.

Next, we calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill can dig half as fast through clay, which is 4 feet per hour / 2 = 2 feet per hour.
- He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay.
- Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet per hour = 4 hours.

Now, we add the time to dig through the soil and the time to dig through the clay to get the total time:
- Total time = Time through soil + Time through clay = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

Therefore, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

"To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for Clara and Sheila, taking into account the discounts and vouchers.

First, let's calculate the cost for Clara:

- Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each.
- The total cost before the voucher is 20 pomegranates * $20/pomegranate = $400.
- Clara had a voucher for $2 off, so the final cost for Clara is $400 - $2 = $398.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Sheila:

- Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at the new price of $30 each.
- The total cost before the discount is 20 pomegranates * $30/pomegranate = $600.
- The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is 10% of $600 = 0.10 * $600 = $60.
- The final cost for Sheila after the discount is $600 - $60 = $540.

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid:

- The difference is Sheila's final cost - Clara's final cost = $540 - $398 = $142.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $142.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month.
2. Calculate the total sales for the first month by adding the sales from red and green hats.
3. Calculate the total sales for the second month, which is 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.
4. Add the total sales of the first and second months to get the total amount made in two months.

Step 1: The sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Therefore, the sales from green hats were twice the sales from red hats:
Sales from green hats = 2 * $400 = $800

Step 2: The total sales for the first month are the sum of the sales from red and green hats:
Total sales for the first month = $400 (red) + $800 (green) = $1200

Step 3: The total sales for the second month are 3/4 of the total sales of the first month:
Total sales for the second month = 3/4 * $1200 = $900

Step 4: The total amount made in two months is the sum of the sales from both months:
Total amount made in two months = $1200 (first month) + $900 (second month) = $2100

"James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The cost for the first paid hour is $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost of the previous hour.

So the cost for the second hour is $15 * 2 = $30.
The cost for the third hour is $30 * 2 = $60.

Now we add up the costs for the three paid hours:
$15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $60 (third hour) = $105.

Therefore, James paid $105 for the carriage.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed for the guests.
2. Determine the number of whole eggs required based on the number of deviled egg halves.
3. Convert the number of whole eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Total number of deviled egg halves needed
Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests.
Total deviled egg halves = 3 halves/guest * 16 guests = 48 halves

Step 2: Number of whole eggs required
Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we can find the number of whole eggs needed by dividing the total number of deviled egg halves by 2.
Number of whole eggs = 48 halves / 2 halves/egg = 24 eggs

Step 3: Convert whole eggs to dozens
There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the number of whole eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.
Number of dozens = 24 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 2 dozens

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

Number of days to complete the book: 200 pages / 10 pages/day = 20 days

Since the assignment is to be completed within 30 days, we can find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish by subtracting the number of days it will take him to read the book from the total number of days available.

Days before the deadline: 30 days - 20 days = 10 days

"To calculate the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel expenses.

1. Initial cost of the plane: $150,000
2. Monthly hanger rental: $5,000
3. Monthly fuel expenses: $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Now, we calculate the total monthly maintenance cost (hanger rental + fuel expenses) and then multiply by 12 to get the annual maintenance cost.

Monthly maintenance cost: $5,000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000
Annual maintenance cost: $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost to get the total cost for the first year.

Total cost for the first year: $150,000 (plane) + $180,000 (maintenance) = $330,000

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Finley cooked rice for 30 minutes.
2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so the cooking time for pork is 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.
3. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 minutes + 50 minutes = 80 minutes.
4. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so the cooking time for beans is 80 minutes / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, to find out how long it took to cook all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:

30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) + 40 minutes (beans) = 120 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, and geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We are given that the total number of legs is 70 and the total number of heads is 20. This gives us the following equations:

1. \( S + G = 20 \) (the total number of heads)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (the total number of legs)

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of \( S \) and \( G \).

First, we can solve the first equation for \( G \):

\( G = 20 - S \)

Now we can substitute \( G \) in the second equation:

\( 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \)

Simplify and solve for \( S \):

\( 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \)
\( 2S = 30 \)
\( S = 15 \)

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, so for a week's worth, he needs 7 pounds. The more expensive brand of coffee costs 20% more than the normal brand, which is $5 per pound.

To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we calculate 20% of $5 and add it to the original price:

20% of $5 = 0.20 * $5 = $1

So the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

For 7 pounds, the cost would be 7 * $6 = $42.

Adding the cost of the donut, which is $2, the total cost is:

$42 + $2 = $44

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much money Kassidy has. We know that Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120.

Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * $120
Kassidy's money = $90

2. Next, we need to find out how much money Rayna has. We know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy.

Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + $60
Rayna's money = $90 + $60
Rayna's money = $150

3. Now we can calculate the total amount of money they have together.

Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = $120 + $90 + $150
Total money = $360

4. Finally, we need to find out how much each person would have if they shared the total amount equally.

Money per person = Total money / 3
Money per person = $360 / 3
Money per person = $120

So, if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them, each would have $120.

"Christina had a total of 12 good days in the past thirty days. The next three days included two good days and one neutral day. Therefore, the total number of good days after these three days would be 12 (from the past thirty days) + 2 (from the next three days) = 14 good days.

Since the month has 30 days and we are now considering 33 days in total (30 past days + 3 next days), we need to determine how many good days are left in the month. However, since the month only has 30 days, the next three days are already beyond the month's scope. Thus, the number of good days in the month remains 12, as the additional good days occurred after the month ended.

But if we interpret the question as asking how many good days are left in the 33-day period after the next three days, then the answer would be 14 good days in total, but we need to subtract the good days that have already occurred in the first 30 days and the next three days.

So, the number of good days left in the 33-day period after the next three days is 14 (total good days) - 12 (good days in the first 30 days) - 2 (good days in the next three days) = 0 good days left.

However, since the question asks for the number of good days left in the month, the answer is 0 because the month has already ended and all good days have been accounted for.

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can write the equation for their combined ages as:

\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Now we can substitute \( T \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 44 - 14 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

First, we calculate the total cost of the lollipops:
5 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $2.00

Now we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the four candies:

So, in 120 months, Neil will have saved:
28 coins/month * 120 months = 3360 coins

Together, Rong and Neil will have saved:
2400 coins (Rong) + 3360 coins (Neil) = 5760 coins

"Let's break down the costs and calculate the total bill for John.

1. The cost of the two vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.
2. Let the total bill be T. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so it costs 0.60 * T.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
T = $40 + 0.60 * T

To find the total bill, we need to solve for T:
T - 0.60 * T = $40
0.40 * T = $40
T = $40 / 0.40
T = $100

So the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
$125 - $100 = $25

"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum them up.

1. The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, so:
   Cost of one banana = 2 * $0.5 = $1.0

2. The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so:
   Cost of one orange = 3 * $1.0 = $3.0

3. Now we can calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
   - Total cost of bananas = 5 bananas * $1.0/banana = $5.0
   - Total cost of apples = 12 apples * $0.5/apple = $6.0
   - Total cost of oranges = 7 oranges * $3.0/orange = $21.0

4. Finally, we sum up the total costs to get the price of the crate:
   Total price of the crate = $5.0 + $6.0 + $21.0 = $32.0

"To find the total number of square feet of Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the number of squares of each color and then sum them up.

1. Red squares: 14
2. Blue squares: 14 (red) + 4 = 18
3. Green squares: 18 (blue) + 6 = 24
4. White squares: 24 (green) - 12 = 12

Now, we add up all the squares to get the total number of squares, which is equal to the total square feet since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot.

Total square feet = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white)

Total square feet = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12
Total square feet = 68

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of chairs required for the function and compare it to the number of chairs Mia's restaurant currently has.

First, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed:
- There are 42 adults, and each adult will need a regular chair.
- There are 15 babies, and each baby will need a high chair.

Total chairs needed = 42 (for adults) + 15 (for babies) = 57 chairs

Next, let's determine how many chairs the restaurant currently has:
- The restaurant has 8 high chairs.
- The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, so it has 5 * 8 = 40 regular chairs.

Total chairs available = 40 (regular) + 8 (high) = 48 chairs

Now, we can find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get:
Chairs needed - Chairs available = 57 - 48 = 9 chairs

Mia has to get 9 more chairs.

"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we first need to determine the number of bucks in the field. Since 50 percent of the deer are bucks, we can calculate the number of bucks as follows:

Number of bucks = 50 percent of 50 deer
Number of bucks = 0.50 * 50
Number of bucks = 25

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8-point bucks. Since 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points, we can calculate the number of 8-point bucks as follows:

Number of 8-point bucks = 20 percent of 25 bucks
Number of 8-point bucks = 0.20 * 25
Number of 8-point bucks = 5

Therefore, there are 5 8-point bucks in the field.

"To find out how many points the class is missing to go on the trip, we need to calculate the total points collected by all the students and then subtract this from the minimum threshold of 400 points.

1. Adam has collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. To find out how many points Betty has, we calculate 30% of Adam's points and add it to Adam's points:
   Betty's points = Adam's points + (30% of Adam's points)
   Betty's points = 50 + (0.30 * 50)
   Betty's points = 50 + 15
   Betty's points = 65
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty:
   Tom's points = Betty's points - 30
   Tom's points = 65 - 30
   Tom's points = 35
4. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom:
   Martha's points = 3 * Tom's points
   Martha's points = 3 * 35
   Martha's points = 105

Now, let's add up all the points collected by the students:
Total points = Adam's points + Betty's points + Tom's points + Martha's points
Total points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105
Total points = 255

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points from the threshold:
Points missing = Minimum threshold - Total points
Points missing = 400 - 255
Points missing = 145

"To find out how many fireworks Hannah will see in total, we need to calculate the number of fireworks from the city's display that she can see and add to that the number of fireworks she will set off in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks in the city's display:
15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we calculate:
40% of 300 fireworks = 0.40 * 300 = 120 fireworks

Next, we calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:
3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks

Now, we add the fireworks Hannah will see from the city's display to the fireworks she will set off:
120 fireworks + 15 fireworks = 135 fireworks

Therefore, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of people, the total number of drinks, the total number of snacks, and then the total cost of the drinks and snacks.

First, let's find the total number of people:
Aiden + 12 friends + 7 more friends = 1 + 12 + 7 = 20 people

Each person saves a seat, and each seat can hold two drinks and three snacks. So, for 20 seats, the total number of drinks and snacks is:
Total drinks = 20 seats * 2 drinks/seat = 40 drinks
Total snacks = 20 seats * 3 snacks/seat = 60 snacks

Now, we calculate the total cost for the drinks and snacks:
Cost of drinks = 40 drinks * $2/drink = $80
Cost of snacks = 60 snacks * $2/snack = $120

Finally, we add the cost of drinks and snacks to find the total amount spent:
Total cost = Cost of drinks + Cost of snacks = $80 + $120 = $200

The group has spent $200 overall on snacks and drinks.

"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first determine the capacity of Gordy's truck and then use the total capacity of all three trucks to find Gary's truck capacity.

Gissela's truck capacity: 4,000 pounds
Gordy's truck capacity: 4,000 pounds + 800 pounds = 4,800 pounds

Combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks: 4,000 pounds + 4,800 pounds = 8,800 pounds

The total capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. To find Gary's truck capacity, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity:

Gary's truck capacity: 11,600 pounds - 8,800 pounds = 2,800 pounds

"To find out how many dumplings Larry cooked, we need to calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males and females.

Each female ate 3 dumplings, and there are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
6 females * 3 dumplings/female = 18 dumplings

Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate:
3 dumplings/female + 1 dumpling = 4 dumplings

There are 8 males, including Larry, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
8 males * 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings

The total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by the males and the females:
18 dumplings (females) + 32 dumplings (males) = 50 dumplings

Therefore, Larry cooked 50 dumplings.

"To find out how many feet Martha's turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to determine the speed of the turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

The cat's speed is 15 feet/second, so the turtle's speed is:

15 feet/second ÷ 5 = 3 feet/second

Now that we know the turtle's speed, we can calculate how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds:

3 feet/second × 40 seconds = 120 feet

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the firefighters are raising money. We can do this by dividing the amount raised in the first 3 hours by the number of hours to find the hourly rate.

The amount raised in the first 3 hours is $2100. So, the hourly rate is:

$2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour

Next, we need to find out how much more money they need to reach their goal of $6300. We can do this by subtracting the amount already raised from the goal:

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Now, we can find out how many more hours they need to fundraise by dividing the remaining amount needed by the hourly rate:

$4200 / $700 per hour = 6 hours

Since they have already fundraised for 3 hours, we need to add the additional hours to the initial hours to find the total number of hours they have to fundraise:

3 hours + 6 hours = 9 hours

Therefore, the firefighters have to fundraise in total for 9 hours to reach their goal.

"To find the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the percent of the river's water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract that from the total percent of water used by the city to find the non-industrial use.

Step 1: The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. So, the industrial water use is:
40% * 80% = 0.40 * 0.80 = 0.32 or 32% of the river's total water.

Step 2: The non-industrial water use is the remaining portion of the 40% used by the city:
40% - 32% = 8%.

So, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the production rate for each flavor of ice cream and then determine how much can be produced in 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- The production rate is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- The production rate is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we calculate the total production for each flavor in 48 hours:
- Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts.
- Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts.

The total production of both flavors in 48 hours is:

"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy with her $6.00, we need to take into account the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free.

Each scoop costs $1.50, so for 2 scoops, Erin would pay $3.00. With the deal, she gets an additional scoop for free, which means for $3.00, she gets 3 scoops.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops she can get with $6.00:

$6.00 / $3.00 per set = 2 sets

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, the total number of scoops she can get is:

2 sets * 3 scoops per set = 6 scoops

So, Erin should buy 6 scoops of ice cream.

"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each of them has consumed and then subtract that from their initial amount of candy.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she will have eaten:
4 pieces/day * 14 days = 56 pieces

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she will have eaten:
3 pieces/day * 14 days = 42 pieces

Now, we subtract the amount each has eaten from their initial 100 pieces to find out how much they have left.

Ginger's remaining candy:
100 pieces - 56 pieces = 44 pieces

Amy's remaining candy:
100 pieces - 42 pieces = 58 pieces

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining amount from Amy's remaining amount:
58 pieces - 44 pieces = 14 pieces

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks.

"To determine how much James saved by picking blueberries compared to buying them at the store, we need to calculate the total cost of picking and the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store.

First, let's calculate the cost of picking 30 pounds of blueberries:
- The fixed cost to go picking is $20.
- The cost per pound of blueberries picked is $1.5.
- The total cost for the blueberries picked is 30 pounds * $1.5/pound.

Total cost of picking = Fixed cost + (Cost per pound * Number of pounds)
Total cost of picking = $20 + (30 * $1.5)

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 30 pounds of blueberries at the store:
- The cost per pound at the store is $2.5.
- The total cost for the blueberries bought is 30 pounds * $2.5/pound.

Total cost of buying = Cost per pound * Number of pounds
Total cost of buying = 30 * $2.5

Finally, we'll calculate the savings by subtracting the total cost of picking from the total cost of buying.

Savings = Total cost of buying - Total cost of picking

Let's do the math:

Total cost of picking = $20 + (30 * $1.5) = $20 + $45 = $65

- Right foot: 300 taps per minute for 3 minutes (since her arms are raised for only 2 minutes out of the 5)
- Left foot: 250 taps per minute for 3 minutes

Next, we calculate the number of taps for each foot when her arms are raised:
- Right foot: 200 taps per minute for 2 minutes
- Left foot: 200 taps per minute for 2 minutes

Now, we can calculate the total number of taps for each foot:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of slices each person ate and then subtract that from the total number of slices available.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, they each ate:
2/3 * 12 = 8 slices

The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas, so they each ate:
3/4 * 12 = 9 slices

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends:
3 people * 8 slices/person = 24 slices

And the total number of slices eaten by the other two friends:
2 people * 9 slices/person = 18 slices

The total number of slices eaten by all five friends is:
24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices

Since there were 5 pizzas, the total number of slices available was:
5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices

The number of slices left is the total number of slices minus the number of slices eaten:

"To find the average time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages, we first need to determine how long it takes the dog to eat nine sausages.

The cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages. The dog takes 2/3 of the time the cat takes, so we calculate the dog's time as follows:

Dog's time = 2/3 * Cat's time
Dog's time = 2/3 * 30 minutes
Dog's time = 20 minutes

Now we have the time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages:

- Cat's time: 30 minutes
- Dog's time: 20 minutes

To find the average time, we add the two times together and divide by 2:

Average time = (Cat's time + Dog's time) / 2
Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2
Average time = 50 minutes / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches.

Topher's shoe length in inches is:
8 feet * 12 inches/foot + 4 inches = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. We can set up the following equation to represent this relationship, where \( b \) is the length of Bobby's shoe in inches:

100 inches = 9 * b + 10 inches

Now, we solve for \( b \):

100 inches - 10 inches = 9 * b
90 inches = 9 * b
b = 90 inches / 9
b = 10 inches

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teacher's car has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in teachers' cars is 32 * 2 = 64 windows.

Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows:
- Three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows is 64 * 3/4 = 48 windows.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed in students' cars to the number of windows smashed in teachers' cars to get the total number of windows smashed:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (students' windows) + 48 (teachers' windows) = 112 windows.

"To find the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of blue spools (light blue and dark blue).
2. Calculate the total number of all spools.
3. Divide the number of blue spools by the total number of spools.
4. Multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage.

Let's do the math:

1. Total number of blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60 spools
2. Total number of all spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150 spools
3. Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100

Now, let's calculate the percentage:

(60 / 150) * 100 = 0.4 * 100 = 40%

"At 8:00, there were 5000 people lined up to vote.

By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. To find out how many people that is, we calculate:
2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people

So, 2000 people had voted by midday, which means:
5000 - 2000 = 3000 people had not voted yet.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining 3000 people had voted. To find out how many people that is, we calculate:
2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people

So, 2000 more people had voted by 16:00, which means:
3000 - 2000 = 1000 people had not voted by 16:00.

"To find out how many boxes of graham crackers are needed, we need to calculate the total number of smores that will be made and then determine how many sleeves are required to make that many smores.

First, let's calculate the total number of smores the kids will eat:
9 kids * 2 smores per kid = 18 smores

Next, let's calculate the total number of smores the adults will eat:
6 adults * 1 smore per adult = 6 smores

Now, let's add the smores for kids and adults to get the total number of smores:
18 smores (kids) + 6 smores (adults) = 24 smores

Each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores, so we need to find out how many sleeves are required for 24 smores:
24 smores / 8 smores per sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we can now determine how many boxes are needed:
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box

Therefore, they will need 1 box of graham crackers.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a few equations based on the information given:

1. Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age.
2. Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father.
3. Dora is 15 years old.

Let's denote Dora's age as \( D \), her father's age as \( F \), and her mother's age as \( M \).

From the information given, we have:

\( D = 15 \) (Dora's age)

\( F = 2D + 8 \) (Dora's father's age)

\( M = F - 4 \) (Dora's mother's age)

Now we can substitute \( D \) into the equation for \( F \):

\( F = 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \) (Dora's father's age)

Next, we can find \( M \) by substituting \( F \) into the equation for \( M \):

\( M = 38 - 4 = 34 \) (Dora's mother's age)

Now we can calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:

\( D + F + M = 15 + 38 + 34 \)

\( D + F + M = 87 \)

The total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87.

"To find out how many votes candidate C received, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of votes candidate A received.
2. Calculate the number of votes candidate B received, which is 50% more than candidate A's votes.
3. Subtract the votes of candidates A and B from the total number of votes to find the votes for candidate C.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Candidate A received 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, candidate A received:
   20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes

2. Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A. So, candidate B received:
   50% of 20 votes = 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes more than candidate A
   Therefore, candidate B received:
   20 votes + 10 votes = 30 votes

3. The total number of votes is 100. Subtract the votes of candidates A and B to find the votes for candidate C:
   100 votes - 20 votes (A) - 30 votes (B) = 50 votes

Candidate C received 50 votes.

"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

Beck's apples = Boris's apples - 23
Beck's apples = 100 - 23
Beck's apples = 77

Now, if Boris gives Beck 10 apples, we need to adjust the number of apples each has:

Boris's new number of apples = Boris's original apples - 10
Boris's new number of apples = 100 - 10
Boris's new number of apples = 90

Beck's new number of apples = Beck's original apples + 10
Beck's new number of apples = 77 + 10
Beck's new number of apples = 87

Now we can find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after the transaction:

Fewer apples = Boris's new number of apples - Beck's new number of apples
Fewer apples = 90 - 87
Fewer apples = 3

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for the ice cubes and then subtract that from the initial 32 ounces.

First, we calculate the water used for each type of ice cube:

- Giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces/cube = 12 ounces
- Medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces
- Small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 4 ounces

Now, we add up the water used for all the cubes:

12 ounces (giant) + 14 ounces (medium) + 4 ounces (small) = 30 ounces

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:

32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces

So, Peter has 2 ounces of water left.

"To solve the problem, let's start by defining the number of books each person has in terms of Steven's books.

Let \( S \) represent the number of books Steven has.

According to the problem:
- Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has \( S + 6 \) books.
- Clara has two times as many books as Steven, so Clara has \( 2S \) books.

We are given that Clara has 20 books, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S = 20 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{20}{2} \]
\[ S = 10 \]

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find out how many books Alice has:
\[ S + 6 = 10 + 6 \]
\[ S + 6 = 16 \]

Alice has 16 books. We already know that Clara has 20 books. To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. We know that a gallon jar costs $5 and that it is $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the cost of a half-gallon jar:

Cost of a gallon jar = Cost of a half-gallon jar + $2

Let's denote the cost of a half-gallon jar as \( H \). Then we have:

\( 5 = H + 2 \)

Solving for \( H \), we get:

\( H = 5 - 2 \)
\( H = 3 \)

So, a half-gallon jar costs $3.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars:

Total cost of gallon jars = 10 * $5
Total cost of half-gallon jars = 16 * $3

Total amount spent = (10 * 5) + (16 * 3)

Let's do the math:

Total amount spent = (10 * 5) + (16 * 3)
Total amount spent = 50 + 48
Total amount spent = 98

"To find out how many students like to play video games, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who like to play music.
2. Subtract the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music from the total number of students to find out how many like to play video games.

Step 1: The number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is:
2 * 5 = 10

Step 2: Now, we can subtract the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music from the total number of students:
50 (total students) - 10 (baking) - 5 (basketball) - 10 (music) = 25

So, 25 students like to play video games.

Next, we need to find out how many of those students are girls. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, we can calculate the number of girls in one class as follows:

40% of 40 students = 0.40 * 40 = 16 girls

Now, to find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in the class:

40 students - 16 girls = 24 boys

So, there are 24 boys in each class.

"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to determine the number of chairs rented on weekdays and weekends, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of weekdays and weekends in two 4-week months:

- There are 5 weekdays in a week.
- There are 2 weekend days in a week.
- There are 4 weeks in a month.

So, in two 4-week months, there are:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.
2. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 27, so she trades 27 small stickers.
3. Since a small sticker is worth one small button, 27 small stickers are worth 27 small buttons.
4. A large button is worth three small stickers, so 27 small buttons can be traded for 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.
5. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 20, so she trades 20 large stickers.
6. Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 20 large stickers are worth 20 large buttons.
7. She has 20 large stickers left (50% of 40) and trades them for small buttons. Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so 20 large stickers are worth 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.
8. Now, let's add up all the buttons she has:
   - 9 large buttons from trading small stickers
   - 20 large buttons from trading half of her large stickers
   - 60 small buttons from trading the rest of her large stickers
   - 3 small stickers that she did not trade (10% of 30)

So, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is:

9 large buttons + 20 large buttons + 60 small buttons + 3 small buttons = 9 + 20 + 60 + 3 = 92 buttons.

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second one:

\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now that we know the number of votes against the regulation is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor:

Step 2: Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so the cost for 20 kilograms would be:
20 kilograms * $3/kilogram = $60.

Therefore, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

"Ezra read 300 books this hour and decided to read 150 more, which means Ezra will have read a total of 300 + 150 = 450 books.

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, Ahmed must have read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Together, they have read 450 (Ezra's total) + 150 (Ahmed's total) = 600 books.

"To calculate Tanya's earnings, we need to consider her hourly rate and the additional daily rate if she teaches more than 3 classes.

On Monday:
- She teaches 4 classes, which is more than 3, so she gets an additional $5 for the day.
- She works for 5 hours at $15 per hour, so her earnings for the hours worked are 5 * $15 = $75.
- Adding the additional daily rate, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday:
- She teaches 2 classes, which is not more than 3, so she does not get the additional $5 for the day.
- She works for 2 hours at $15 per hour, so her earnings for the hours worked are 2 * $15 = $30.
- Since she does not qualify for the additional daily rate, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Adding the earnings from both days:
- Total earnings = Monday's earnings + Wednesday's earnings = $80 + $30 = $110.

Therefore, Tanya earned $110 for these two days of teaching.

"To find out what percentage of her weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total available time for the weekend.
2. Subtract the time she spends reading.
3. Calculate the time she spends playing video games.
4. Subtract the time spent on video games from the remaining time to find out how much time she spends playing soccer.
5. Calculate the percentage of the total weekend time that is spent playing soccer.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Total available time for the weekend:
   7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

2. Subtract the time she spends reading:
   12 hours - 3 hours (reading) = 9 hours remaining

3. Calculate the time she spends playing video games (1/3 of the remaining time):
   1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

4. Subtract the time spent on video games from the remaining time to find out how much time she spends playing soccer:
   9 hours (remaining) - 3 hours (video games) = 6 hours (soccer)

5. Calculate the percentage of the total weekend time that is spent playing soccer:
   (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100% = 50%

So, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer.

"To calculate the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to consider the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent at the museum, and the time spent driving back home.

First, we calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles and he drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time to drive to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{\text{Distance to museum}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the trip back home is the same distance and he drives at the same speed, the time to drive back is also 2 hours.

The total driving time is:

\[ \text{Total driving time} = \text{Time to museum} + \text{Time back home} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, the total time he is gone from home is:

\[ \text{Total time gone} = \text{Total driving time} + \text{Time at museum} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels

Next, we calculate the number of wheels needed for the motorcycles:
73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Now, we add the wheels needed for both cars and motorcycles to get the total number of wheels required:
228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels

Finally, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the number of wheels Henry has in the box:
650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

So, the number of wheels left in the box will be:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts:

1. Calculate the number of movies that are part of a series.
2. Calculate the cost of the series movies.
3. Calculate the number of remaining movies after the series movies are accounted for.
4. Calculate the number of older movies from the remaining movies.
5. Calculate the cost of the older movies.
6. Calculate the number of normal movies from the remaining movies.
7. Calculate the cost of the normal movies.
8. Sum up the costs from steps 2, 5, and 7 to get the total cost.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Number of series movies:
   \( \frac{1}{3} \) of 600 movies = \( \frac{600}{3} \) = 200 movies

2. Cost of series movies:
   Since the series movies cost $6 each, the total cost for series movies is:
   200 movies * $6/movie = $1200

3. Number of remaining movies:
   600 movies - 200 series movies = 400 movies

4. Number of older movies:
   40% of the remaining 400 movies = \( 0.40 \times 400 \) = 160 movies

5. Cost of older movies:
   Since older movies cost $5 each, the total cost for older movies is:
   160 movies * $5/movie = $800

6. Number of normal movies:
   400 movies - 160 older movies = 240 movies

7. Cost of normal movies:
   Since normal movies cost $10 each, the total cost for normal movies is:
   240 movies * $10/movie = $2400

8. Total cost:
   Total cost = Cost of series movies + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
   Total cost = $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

The total cost for replacing the movies is $4400.

"To find the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance they covered while driving and the distance they covered while hiking.

First, let's calculate the distance they drove:
- They drove for 6 hours in total.
- They hiked for 1.5 hours, so they drove for 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours.
- They drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
- The distance they drove is 4.5 hours * 50 miles/hour = 225 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance they hiked:
- They hiked at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
- Half their driving speed is 50 miles per hour / 2 = 25 miles per hour.
- Their hiking speed is 25 miles per hour - 5 miles per hour = 20 miles per hour.
- The distance they hiked is 1.5 hours * 20 miles/hour = 30 miles.

Finally, we add the distances together to get the total distance to the vacation spot:
- Total distance = distance driven + distance hiked = 225 miles + 30 miles = 255 miles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the number of enemies Emma jumps on be E, the number of berries she collects be B, and the number of seconds left on her timer be T.

Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on E + 8 enemies.
Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so she collects B + 3 berries.
Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so she has T - 4 seconds left on her timer.

The score for Emma is:
Score_Emma = 10 * E + 5 * B + 30 * T

The score for Ava is:
Score_Ava = 10 * (E + 8) + 5 * (B + 3) + 30 * (T - 4)

Now, let's calculate the difference between their scores:
Difference = Score_Ava - Score_Emma
           = (10 * (E + 8) + 5 * (B + 3) + 30 * (T - 4)) - (10 * E + 5 * B + 30 * T)
           = (10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120) - (10E + 5B + 30T)
           = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 - 10E - 5B - 30T
           = 80 + 15 - 120
           = 95 - 120
           = -25

The difference between their two scores is -25, which means Emma's score is 25 points higher than Ava's.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

After buying more fish, he had a total of:
- 3 + (number of orange fish bought) orange fish
- 4 + (number of white fish bought) white fish

We know that after buying the fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of orange fish bought as O and the number of white fish bought as W. The total number of fish bought is 17, so we have:

O + W = 17

And we also know that the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish after the purchase:

3 + O = 2 * (4 + W)

Now we can solve these equations. First, we'll express O in terms of W from the first equation:

O = 17 - W

Now we substitute O in the second equation:

3 + (17 - W) = 2 * (4 + W)
20 - W = 8 + 2W
20 - 8 = 2W + W
12 = 3W
W = 4

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

"To calculate the weekly cost of fuel for Andy's car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy drives to work in a week.
2. Determine the total amount of fuel used in a week.
3. Calculate the total cost of the fuel used in a week.

Step 1: Total distance driven in a week
Andy drives to work and back home each day, so the round trip is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles per day.
Since he drives from Monday to Friday, the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles.

Step 2: Total amount of fuel used in a week
Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon (MPG). To find out how many gallons he uses in a week, we divide the total distance by the fuel efficiency:
50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons.

Step 3: Total cost of the fuel used in a week
The price of gas is $3 per gallon, so the total cost for the week is:
5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15.

Therefore, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week for his commute to work.

"To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the temperature at night.
2. Determine the difference between the night temperature and the freezing point.
3. Calculate how many logs are needed to raise the temperature to at least 32 degrees.

Step 1: Calculate the night temperature.
Night temperature = Day temperature - 33 degrees
Night temperature = 45 degrees - 33 degrees
Night temperature = 12 degrees

Step 2: Determine the difference between the night temperature and the freezing point.
Difference = Freezing point - Night temperature
Difference = 32 degrees - 12 degrees
Difference = 20 degrees

Step 3: Calculate how many logs are needed.
Each log heats the house by 5 degrees, so the number of logs needed is:
Number of logs = Difference / Degrees heated per log
Number of logs = 20 degrees / 5 degrees per log
Number of logs = 4

Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of groups formed.
2. Calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells.
3. Calculate the total number of seashells brought back by these groups.

Step 1: Determine the total number of groups formed.
Since 90 people are split into 9-person groups, we divide 90 by 9 to get the total number of groups:
90 / 9 = 10 groups

Step 2: Calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells.
3/5 of the groups brought back seashells, so we multiply the total number of groups by 3/5:
10 * (3/5) = 6 groups

Step 3: Calculate the total number of seashells brought back by these groups.
Each of the 6 groups had 9 members, and each member brought back 2 seashells. So, we multiply the number of groups by the number of members per group and then by the number of seashells each member brought back:
6 * 9 * 2 = 108 seashells

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and then subtract that from the $50.00 bill he pays with.

The discount on the jeans is 25% of the original price. So, we calculate the discount amount as follows:

Discount amount = 25% of $40
                = 0.25 * $40
                = $10

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the sale price of the jeans:

Sale price = Original price - Discount amount
           = $40 - $10
           = $30

Finally, we subtract the sale price from the $50.00 bill to find out how much money Mike will have left over:

Money left over = $50.00 - Sale price
                = $50.00 - $30

"To find out how many trees will be planted at the end of the campaign, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class.
- Each student plants 1 tree.

Number of trees planted by students = Number of classes * Number of students per class * Trees planted per student
Number of trees planted by students = 40 * 25 * 1
Number of trees planted by students = 1000

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- There are 40 classes with 3 teachers per class.
- Each teacher plants 2 trees.

Number of trees planted by teachers = Number of classes * Number of teachers per class * Trees planted per teacher
Number of trees planted by teachers = 40 * 3 * 2
Number of trees planted by teachers = 240

Now, we add the number of trees planted by students and teachers to get the total number of trees planted:

Total number of trees planted = Number of trees planted by students + Number of trees planted by teachers
Total number of trees planted = 1000 + 240
Total number of trees planted = 1240

Kris is trying to earn a video game achievement for playing a total of 30 hours. To find out how many hours she still needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required:

30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours

Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement.

"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car will travel in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles

The difference in distance between the two cars after 2 hours will be:
140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

Therefore, the two cars will be 20 miles apart after 2 hours.

"To find out how much James paid for the ring, we need to calculate the total cost of the materials and then add the 30% premium.

The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. So, the total cost of the materials is:

$600 (diamond) + $300 (gold) = $900

Next, we calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of the materials:

30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the materials to find out the final amount James paid:

$900 (materials) + $270 (premium) = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring.

"To find the school's overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and divide it by the total number of students.

First, we calculate the pass rate for each grade:

- Third graders: 340 out of 500 passed, which is a pass rate of 340/500.
- Fourth graders: 40 out of 100 passed, which is a pass rate of 40/100.
- Fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it's 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. Since there are 400 fifth graders, the number who passed is 400 * (80/100).

Now we calculate the number of fifth graders who passed:

400 * (80/100) = 400 * 0.8 = 320

Next, we add up the number of students who passed from all grades:

340 (third graders) + 40 (fourth graders) + 320 (fifth graders) = 700

Now we add up the total number of students:

500 (third graders) + 100 (fourth graders) + 400 (fifth graders) = 1000

Finally, we calculate the overall pass rate:

700 (total passed) / 1000 (total students) = 0.7

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.7 * 100 = 70%

The school's overall pass rate is 70%.

"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made with the total number of glass chips.
3. Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, divide the total square inches by 3 to find the length in inches.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total number of glass chips:
   - Each bag holds 72 chips.
   - Milo has 2 bags.
   - Total chips = 72 chips/bag * 2 bags = 144 chips.

2. Total square inches of mosaic:
   - It takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch.
   - Total square inches = 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches.

3. Length of the mosaic:
   - The mosaic is 3 inches tall.
   - Length = Total square inches / Height = 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea that was consumed and then add the 10 quarts that were left over. After that, we will convert the total quarts to gallons, knowing that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts.

First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students who each drank 1.5 quarts:
4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts

Next, we calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the 16 students who each drank 2 quarts:
16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts

Now, we add the tea consumed by all the students together:
6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts

Then, we add the 10 quarts that were left over to find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party:
38 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts

Finally, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
48 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 12 gallons

"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150, which means he sold all of his initial stock and needed to fulfill an additional 50 orders. After selling 150, he ordered 100 more candies. To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell to sell all of his candy, we need to account for the additional 50 orders that were not covered by his initial stock and the 100 new candies he ordered.

So, Dale needs to sell the 50 candies to cover the excess orders plus the 100 new candies he ordered, which totals to 150 candies.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of May and then subtract the initial number of students (10) to find out how many additional students have joined.

Let's break it down month by month:

- At the beginning of the year (January), there are 10 students.
- At the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

Now, to find the number of additional students that have joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

320 (end of May) - 10 (beginning of the year) = 310 additional students.

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to know how many days he worked during the week. A typical week has 7 days. We can then divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch to find out the total number of branches he climbed during the week. After that, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

Let's do the math:

1. Total money made: $105
2. Cost per branch: $0.25
3. Total branches climbed in the week: $105 / $0.25
4. Number of days in a week: 7
5. Average branches climbed per day: (Total branches climbed in the week) / 7

Now, let's calculate:

Total branches climbed in the week = $105 / $0.25 = 420 branches

Average branches climbed per day = 420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches per day

"To find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the number of petals for each type of flower Rose picked, subtract the petals from the flowers she dropped, and then sum the remaining petals.

1. For the first set of flowers, she picked 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
   3 flowers * 5 petals/flower = 15 petals

2. For the second set of flowers, she picked 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
   4 flowers * 6 petals/flower = 24 petals

3. For the third set of flowers, she picked 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
   5 flowers * 4 petals/flower = 20 petals

4. For the last set of flowers, she picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
   6 flowers * 7 petals/flower = 42 petals

Now, we add up all the petals:
15 petals + 24 petals + 20 petals + 42 petals = 101 petals

Since she dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract the petals from one of each type of flower:
1 flower * 5 petals/flower = 5 petals
1 flower * 6 petals/flower = 6 petals
1 flower * 4 petals/flower = 4 petals
1 flower * 7 petals/flower = 7 petals

Total petals from the dropped flowers:
5 petals + 6 petals + 4 petals + 7 petals = 22 petals

Subtract the petals from the dropped flowers from the total:
101 petals - 22 petals = 79 petals

The total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:

"John and DeSean together made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores, which means they used 18 marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows, so in total, 18 + 3 = 21 marshmallows were used or lost. The bag originally had 35 marshmallows, so the number of marshmallows left in the bag is 35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows. Since there are two of them, they can each have 14 / 2 = 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money spent by Jack and his three friends on playing the arcade games for 4 hours.

First, let's determine how long each person can play with one quarter:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
- Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, which is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter.
- One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter.

Next, we need to convert the total playtime from hours to minutes:
- 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Now, we calculate how many quarters each person will use:
- Jack: 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters.
- Two friends: 240 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters each.
- One friend: 240 minutes / 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters.

Finally, we calculate the total number of quarters used and convert that to dollars:
- Jack: 12 quarters.
- Two friends: 24 quarters each, so 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.
- One friend: 8 quarters.

Total quarters used = 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is:
68 quarters * $0.25 per quarter = $17.00.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient Tanya uses:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Let \( f \) be the amount of fragrance in ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Let \( u \) be the amount of sugar in ounces.
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil in ounces.

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( z = f \) (same amount of citrus zest as fragrance)
2. \( s = u \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
3. \( o = 2s \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( s = 2z \) (twice as much salt as zest)

Since the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, we can write the equation:

\[ z + f + s + u + o = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation, we get:

\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 2(2z) = 10 \]

Simplifying, we have:

\[ 2z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now that we know \( z \), we can find the amount of oil:

\[ o = 2s \]
\[ o = 2(2z) \]
\[ o = 2(2 \times 1) \]
\[ o = 4 \]

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

3. Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 20/100 * 40 = 8 cars.
4. Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.
5. The total number of cars Joe no longer has is 8 (sold) + 16 (given away) = 24 cars.
6. Joe originally had 40 cars, so after selling and giving away cars, he has 40 - 24 = 16 cars remaining.

- Each cycle has 5 tasks.
- Each task pays $1.20.

So, the daily earnings are:
30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle * $1.20/task

Now, we calculate the weekly earnings:
- There are 7 days in a week.

So, the weekly earnings are:

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the terms with \( P \):

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( P \):

\[ P = 47 \]

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick has:

\[ 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]

And finally, we can find out how many cards Becca has:

\[ 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards.

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and the amount she will be refunded by Amazon, then subtract the refund from the original cost of the book plus the shipping cost.

1. Calculate the shipping cost based on the weight of the book:
   - The book weighs 4 pounds.
   - The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
   - Shipping cost for weight = 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40.

2. Calculate the shipping cost based on the distance to the distribution center:
   - The distance is 20 miles.
   - The shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
   - Shipping cost for distance = 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60.

3. Calculate the total shipping cost:
   - Total shipping cost = Shipping cost for weight + Shipping cost for distance
   - Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

4. Calculate the refund amount from Amazon:
   - The book cost $32.
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.
   - Refund amount = 75% of $32 = 0.75 * $32 = $24.00.

5. Calculate the total amount Milly will lose:
   - Original cost of the book = $32.00.
   - Total shipping cost = $3.00.
   - Total cost = Original cost of the book + Total shipping cost = $32.00 + $3.00 = $35.00.
   - Amount refunded by Amazon = $24.00.

1. Time spent recording TikTok videos:
- Each video is 4 minutes long.
- She records 18 videos each week.
- In a month with four weeks, she records 18 videos/week * 4 weeks = 72 videos.
- The total time spent recording videos is 72 videos * 4 minutes/video = 288 minutes.

2. Time spent writing amateur songs:
- She spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
- In a month with four weeks, she spends 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours.
- Converting hours to minutes, 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.

3. Time spent doing makeup:
- She spends 15 minutes six days a week doing makeup.
- In a month with four weeks, she does makeup 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 24 days.
- The total time spent doing makeup is 24 days * 15 minutes/day = 360 minutes.

Now, we add up all the time spent on these activities:

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches high.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 inches high.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * (4 * 12) inches high.

Now, let's calculate the height Naruto can lift a mountain in inches and then convert it to feet (1 foot = 12 inches).

Naruto's mountain height in inches:
10 * (4 * 12) = 10 * 48 = 480 inches

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then calculate the time it would take for the turtles to travel the same distance.

First, let's establish the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can assume that the total distance is the same for one kangaroo, as they are traveling at the same speed. Therefore, one kangaroo would also take 18 hours to travel the same distance.

Now, if a turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, it would take twice as long for a turtle to cover the same distance. So, one turtle would take 18 hours * 2 = 36 hours to travel across the highway.

Since we have four turtles, and they are all traveling at the same speed, the time it takes for them to travel the distance is not affected by their number, as they are not helping each other to travel faster. Each turtle will still take 36 hours to travel the distance individually.

Therefore, it will take 36 hours for one turtle, and consequently, it will also take 36 hours for four turtles to travel across the highway, as they are not traveling together in a way that would reduce the time.

Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom is giving her $80, so the total amount from these sources is:

$150 + $80 = $230

Erika still needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means the total amount she has (including the money in her purse) is:

$400 (new price of the laptop) - $50 (amount still needed) = $350

Now, to find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we subtract the amount she received from her job and her mom from the total amount she has:

$350 (total amount she has) - $230 (amount from job and mom) = $120

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To find out how many apple slices are left, we need to calculate the total number of slices Adam gets from slicing the apples and then subtract the number of slices he eats.

First, we calculate the number of slices from the large apples:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

Next, we calculate the number of slices from the small apples:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Now, we add the slices from the large and small apples to get the total number of slices:
15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract that from the total number of slices:
30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices

The number of apple slices left is:

"The farmer currently has 3 cows, each producing 5 liters of milk a day, for a total of 15 liters of milk a day (3 cows * 5 liters/cow = 15 liters/day).

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can calculate the total number of cows needed by dividing the desired daily milk production by the amount of milk one cow produces:

25 liters/day ÷ 5 liters/cow = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, he needs 5 cows - 3 cows = 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and then sum them up.

1. The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the remaining length is:
   \( 12 \times \frac{1}{6} = 2 \) millimeters.

2. The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the remaining length is:
   \( 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 8 \) millimeters.

3. The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the remaining length is:
   \( 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \) millimeters.

Now, we add up the remaining lengths of all three glue sticks:
\( 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \) millimeters.

"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the car and the phone, and then subtract the amount of money he already has.

The cost of the car is $10,000.
The cost of the phone is $800.
The total cost is $10,000 + $800 = $10,800.

Gabriel has $5,000 from working on weekends.
His brother gave him $200.
The total amount Gabriel has is $5,000 + $200 = $5,200.

The amount of money Gabriel still needs is the total cost minus the amount he has:
$10,800 - $5,200 = $5,600.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack has 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Total socks: Jack's socks (30) + Peter's socks (60) = 90 socks
- Total dishes: Jack's dishes (60) + Peter's dishes (30) = 90 dishes

Adding the total number of socks and dishes together:

90 (socks) + 90 (dishes) = 180

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider both the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

We know that:
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, we need to find out how many students are good at both subjects. Since there are 20 students in total, we can subtract the number of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only from the total number of students:

20 (total students) - 5 (math only) - 8 (English only) = 7 (good at both).

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both:

5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12 (good at math).

So, the number of students who are good at math is 12.

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group will take, including the time to get on stage, perform, and exit the stage. We also need to account for the intermission.

Each group will take:
2 minutes to get on stage
6 minutes to perform
2 minutes to exit the stage
Total time per group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. We need to subtract the 10-minute intermission from the total concert time to find out how much time is available for the performances.

Total performance time = Total concert time - Intermission time
Total performance time = 120 minutes - 10 minutes
Total performance time = 110 minutes

Now, we divide the total performance time by the time each group takes to find out how many groups can perform.

Number of groups = Total performance time / Time per group
Number of groups = 110 minutes / 10 minutes
Number of groups = 11

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to use the formula for simple interest:

\[ A = P(1 + rt) \]

where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

In this case, the interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which means \( r = \frac{3}{4} \) of \( P \) per year. However, the interest rate should be a fraction of the principal, not the principal itself. Since the interest is three-quarters of the original amount, the interest rate is actually 75% or 0.75.

Let's plug in the values:

- \( P = 300 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.75 \)
- \( t = 3 \) years

Now we can calculate the interest earned over 3 years:

\[ \text{Interest} = P \times r \times t = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 \]

\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \]

\[ \text{Interest} = 675 \]

Now, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount:

\[ A = P + \text{Interest} = 300 + 675 \]

\[ A = 975 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $975.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The store has 40 white shirts. Half of them have collars, so:
   40 white shirts / 2 = 20 white shirts with collars

2. Since 20 white shirts have collars, the remaining white shirts do not have collars:
   40 white shirts - 20 white shirts with collars = 20 white shirts with no collars

3. The store has 50 floral shirts, and 20 of them have buttons. Therefore, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is:
   50 floral shirts - 20 floral shirts with buttons = 30 floral shirts with no buttons

4. To find out how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars, we subtract the number of white shirts with no collars from the number of floral shirts with no buttons:
   30 floral shirts with no buttons - 20 white shirts with no collars = 10 more floral shirts with no buttons

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes in a year by the total number of pairs of shoes bought in a year.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, so in a year (which has 12 months), he buys:
2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the number of pairs bought:
$2640/year ÷ 24 pairs/year = $110/pair

So, on average, James pays $110 for each pair of shoes.

3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Step 1: Number of rooms to clean
One-half of 90 rooms is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Step 2: Total time in minutes to clean 45 rooms
It takes 20 minutes to clean each room, so for 45 rooms, it would take 45 * 20 = 900 minutes.

- My mom's age: \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \) (one less than three times my brother's age)

The sum of all our ages is 87, so we can write the equation:

\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]
\[ 6x = 87 - 9 \]
\[ 6x = 78 \]
\[ x = 78 / 6 \]
\[ x = 13 \]

"To solve this problem, we can use the formula for exponential growth, where the number of infected people each day is the number of infected people from the previous day multiplied by the number of people each infected person infects.

Let's denote the initial number of infected people as \( I_0 \), which is 10. Each infected person infects 6 others, so the growth factor is 6.

The number of infected people after 1 day (\( I_1 \)) is:
\[ I_1 = I_0 \times 6 \]

The number of infected people after 2 days (\( I_2 \)) is:
\[ I_2 = I_1 \times 6 = I_0 \times 6^2 \]

The number of infected people after 3 days (\( I_3 \)) is:
\[ I_3 = I_2 \times 6 = I_0 \times 6^3 \]

Now we can calculate \( I_3 \):
\[ I_3 = 10 \times 6^3 \]
\[ I_3 = 10 \times 216 \]
\[ I_3 = 2160 \]

So, after three days, 2160 people are infected.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each person earns in a year and then find the difference between the number of badges Wendy earns and the number Amber earns.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. In a year, which has 12 months, Claire will earn:
1 badge/month * 12 months/year = 12 badges/year

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so Amber earns a badge every 2 months. In a year, Amber will earn:
1 badge/2 months * 12 months/year = 6 badges/year

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. In a year, Wendy will earn:

2. A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)
3. S + A + F = 85 (Together, they have 85 books)

We can substitute the first two equations into the third to find the value of F.

First, we express S in terms of F using the second equation:
A = F - 12
S = (F - 12) + 25
S = F + 13

"To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we first need to determine how many glasses each of the boys sold. Since Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold a total of 32 glasses and Julie sold 14 glasses, we can subtract Julie's sales from the total to find out how many glasses the boys sold together.

32 glasses (total) - 14 glasses (Julie's sales) = 18 glasses (boys' sales combined)

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the boys' sales by 2 to find out how many each boy sold.

18 glasses (boys' sales combined) / 2 = 9 glasses (each boy's sales)

Now we know that Micah sold 9 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract Micah's sales from Julie's sales.

14 glasses (Julie's sales) - 9 glasses (Micah's sales) = 5 glasses

Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To find out how much money Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then sum them up.

1. The cost of doing her hair is $400.
2. The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the cost of doing her hair, which is 1/4 * $400 = $100.
3. The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, we add up the costs of all three services to find the total amount spent:

$400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575

So, Iris spent a total of $575 at the spa.

"To determine how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling her rope.
2. Calculate the cost of the new rope.
3. Subtract the cost of the new rope from the money she gets from selling her old rope.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money from selling the rope.
Sarah's rope is 20 meters long and her friend wants to buy it for $2 a meter.
Total money from selling the rope = 20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the new rope.
The new rope costs $1.5 a meter, and Sarah will buy a 20-meter rope.
Cost of the new rope = 20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Step 3: Subtract the cost of the new rope from the money she gets from selling her old rope.
Money left over = Total money from selling the rope - Cost of the new rope
Money left over = $40 - $30 = $10

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can calculate her current age by subtracting 10 from 18.

Current age of Melanie = 18 - 10 = 8 years old

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let's denote the number of years it will take for her age to be three times her current age as \( x \).

In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be \( 8 + x \). We want this to be three times her current age, which is 8, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and then subtract that from her budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the bacon:
5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, so each pack costs $10 / 5 = $2.

Next, the cost of the chicken:
Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet costs $2 * 2 = $4.
The total cost for 6 packets of chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

Now, the cost of the strawberries:
Each pack of strawberries costs $4, so the total cost for 3 packs is 3 * $4 = $12.

Then, the cost of the apples:
Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack costs $4 / 2 = $2.
The total cost for 7 packs of apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
Total cost = cost of bacon + cost of chicken + cost of strawberries + cost of apples
Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14
Total cost = $60

Finally, we subtract the total cost from Kelly's budget to find out how much she has left:
Money left = Kelly’s budget - Total cost
Money left = $65 - $60
Money left = $5

"To find out how long Elaina's usual concerts run for, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the length of her usual concert as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concert plus a 15-minute encore. This can be expressed as:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

"To find out how many chimichangas the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on each of these days.

On Tuesdays, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Fridays, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which is 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, we add the numbers together:

125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500 chimichangas

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many microphones are left without a pair and then subtract that number from the total to find out how many microphones were paired.

20% of the 50 microphones won't find any space, so we calculate 20% of 50:

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 microphones

These 10 microphones are the ones that won't fit in pairs. So, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

50 - 10 = 40 microphones

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs is:

40 / 2 = 20 pairs

"To find the total number of birds Jerry counts, we need to add the number of birds nesting, the number flying overhead, and the number feeding.

First, we know that there are 6 birds nesting in the bushes.

Next, we calculate the number of birds flying overhead, which is 2/3 of the number of nesting birds:
2/3 * 6 = 4 birds flying overhead.

Then, we calculate the number of birds feeding, which is 3 groups of 8 birds each:
3 * 8 = 24 birds feeding.

Now, we add all the numbers together to get the total:
6 (nesting) + 4 (flying overhead) + 24 (feeding) = 34 birds in total.

"To find the speed at which a whirligig spins, we need to first determine the speed of a thingamabob, since the whirligig's speed is a multiple of the thingamabob's speed.

We know that:
- A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.
- A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.

Let's denote the speed of a thingamabob as \( T \) meters per second. Then, the speed of a whatchamacallit is \( 11T \) meters per second. Since the whatchamacallit's speed is given as 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:

\[ 11T = 121 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ T = \frac{121}{11} \]
\[ T = 11 \]

So, a thingamabob spins at 11 meters per second.

Now, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whirligig \( W \) is:

\[ W = 5T \]
\[ W = 5 \times 11 \]
\[ W = 55 \]

The whirligig spins at 55 meters per second.

"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the cost of one carrot as \( c \).

The cost of the salad is $6.
The cost of the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = $3 \).

Ellen eats two carrots, so the cost for the carrots is \( 2c \).

The total cost for her daily food is the sum of the cost of the two carrots, the salad, and the yogurt, which is \( 2c + 6 + 3 \).

We know that the total cost is $11, so we can write the equation as:
\[ 2c + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Now we can solve for \( c \):
\[ 2c + 9 = 11 \]
\[ 2c = 11 - 9 \]
\[ 2c = 2 \]
\[ c = \frac{2}{2} \]
\[ c = 1 \]

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns and then subtract that amount from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \).

From the information given:
- The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
- The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, we can assume that the $6 is the total amount she earned from mowing Joe's lawn. Therefore, if she mowed Joe's lawn \( J \) times, and the total payment is $6, then the payment per mow for Joe's lawn is \( \frac{6}{J} \).

Now, we need to calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:
- Earnings from mowing Joe's lawn: \( 6 \) dollars.
- Earnings from mowing Kamala's lawn: \( 3J \times \frac{6}{J} = 18 \) dollars.
- Earnings from mowing Alba's lawn: \( 5J \times \frac{6}{J} = 30 \) dollars.

The total earnings from mowing lawns is the sum of the earnings from each lawn:
\( 6 + 18 + 30 = 54 \) dollars.

Since Tasha made a total of $80 last month, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:
\( 80 - 54 = 26 \) dollars.

Harry's weight is 74 kg."
"To calculate John's profit from renting out his car, we need to determine his total earnings from the rentals and then subtract his car payment.

First, we calculate the total earnings from the rentals:
- John rents his car 10 times a month.
- Each rental is for 3 hours.
- He gets paid $25 per hour.

Total earnings from rentals = Number of rentals * Hours per rental * Payment per hour
Total earnings from rentals = 10 * 3 * $25
Total earnings from rentals = 30 * $25
Total earnings from rentals = $750

Next, we subtract the car payment from the total earnings to find the profit:
Profit = Total earnings from rentals - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

So, John's profit from renting out his car is $250.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Martha originally had some number of notebooks, let's call this number M.
2. Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, so Joseph had 3M notebooks.
3. Martha then bought 5 more notebooks, bringing her total to 7 notebooks. So, M + 5 = 7.
4. We can solve for M: M = 7 - 5, which means M = 2.
5. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.
6. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks.
7. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's total from Martha's total: 7 - 6 = 1.

Dijana's distance: 50 miles
1/5 of Dijana's distance: 50 miles * 1/5 = 10 miles

Anis's distance: 50 miles + 10 miles = 60 miles

Now, we add Dijana's and Anis's distances to get the total distance they rowed together.

Total distance: 50 miles + 60 miles = 110 miles

"Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since he is eating with his adult wife and their two children, and everyone eats one bowl at a meal, we need to calculate how many bowls of soup will be used for dinner and how many will be left for the children's lunch.

For dinner, there will be:
- 2 adult bowls (Calvin and his wife)
- 2 child bowls (for the two children)

The total number of bowls used for dinner is 2 adult bowls + 2 child bowls. Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, we can convert the adult bowls to child bowls to make the calculation easier:
- 2 adult bowls = 2 * 2 = 4 child bowls

So, the total number of child bowls used for dinner is 4 (from the adults) + 2 (from the children) = 6 child bowls.

The pot can fill 8 child bowls, and 6 have been used for dinner, so the number of child bowls left for lunch is:
8 - 6 = 2 child bowls

Since there are two children, and there are 2 child bowls left, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 1 time.

"To find out how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can calculate the material needed for each type of mask and then add them together.

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- To find out how much material is needed for 1 small mask, we divide 2 yards by 4 masks, which gives us 0.5 yards per small mask.
- For 20 small masks, we multiply 0.5 yards by 20, which equals 10 yards.

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- To find out how much material is needed for 1 large mask, we divide 2.25 yards by 3 masks, which gives us 0.75 yards per large mask.
- For 8 large masks, we multiply 0.75 yards by 8, which equals 6 yards.

Now, we add the material needed for the small masks and the large masks together:
- 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

Therefore, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks.

"To find out how much money the class was able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops and then subtract the total cost of purchasing them.

First, we calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class:
30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops:
300 lollipops * $0.8/lollypop = $240

Then, we calculate the total cost of purchasing the lollipops:
300 lollipops * $0.5/lollypop = $150

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
$240 - $150 = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

"To find out how many pets Larry has, let's break down the information given:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 7 * 3 = 21 fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:

- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47

"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea by subtracting the number of cinnamon tea cups from the total number of cups.
2. Divide the result by 3 to find out how many cups of chamomile and mint tea are in each row.
3. Since the number of chamomile and mint tea cups are equal in each row, divide the number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row by 2 to find the number of mint tea cups in each row.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total cups of chamomile and mint tea: 27 (total cups) - 15 (cinnamon tea cups) = 12 cups
2. Cups of chamomile and mint tea in each row: 12 (chamomile and mint tea cups) / 3 (rows) = 4 cups
3. Cups of mint tea in each row: 4 (chamomile and mint tea cups in each row) / 2 = 2 cups

So, there are 2 cups of mint tea in each row.

"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to calculate how many trips he can make in that time.

Since it takes the sloth 4 hours to make one trip (down, pick berries, and back up), in 8 hours he can make:

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

To collect 24 berries in 2 trips, the sloth must pick up:

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip to meet his goal is 12.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of water Anthony and his father fill into the tank, which is half the amount of water in the pool.
2. Calculate the total amount of water used after 6 days, given the rate of 500 gallons per day.
3. Subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find the remaining amount.

Step 1: The pool has 10,000 gallons of water, so the tank is filled with half of that:
10,000 gallons / 2 = 5,000 gallons

Step 2: The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so after 6 days:
500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3,000 gallons

Step 3: Subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount in the tank:
5,000 gallons - 3,000 gallons = 2,000 gallons

So, after 6 days, there will be 2,000 gallons of water remaining in the tank.

"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his total expenses for the month and subtract that from the $150 he was given.

First, let's calculate the cost of the movies he has already seen:
- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays at $10 each: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days at $7 each: 8 * $7 = $56

Next, let's calculate the cost of the popcorn and candy he has already bought:
- 2 tubs of popcorn at $8 each: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy at $2 each: 4 * $2 = $8

Now, let's add up all his expenses so far:
- Movies: $50 + $56 = $106
- Snacks: $16 + $8 = $24
- Total expenses: $106 + $24 = $130

Colby has $150 to spend, so let's see how much he has left:
- Remaining money: $150 - $130 = $20

On the last day of the month, which is a Friday, he wants to see a movie, get a popcorn, and a box of candy. The cost for this will be:
- Movie ticket: $10
- Popcorn: $8
- Candy: $2
- Total for the night: $10 + $8 + $2 = $20

Since the total for the night is exactly $20, which is the amount he has left, he can see 1 more movie.

"To find the total number of calories in the mini pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins separately, and then add them together.

First, we calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal one, so it has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.
- Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories for the mini cinnamon rolls are 200 rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories.

Next, we calculate the calories for the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal one, so it has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.
- Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories for the mini blueberry muffins are 300 muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories.

Finally, we add the calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins to get the total:
- Total calories = 40,000 calories (from mini cinnamon rolls) + 45,000 calories (from mini blueberry muffins) = 85,000 calories.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days and then divide by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, which is 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as on Monday, which is again 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add up the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days:

39 (Monday) + 78 (Tuesday) + 78 (Wednesday) + 48 (Thursday) + 57 (Friday) = 300 Junebugs.

To find the average, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days:

300 Junebugs / 5 days = 60 Junebugs per day.

"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then subtract the car's distance from the bus's distance.

The formula to calculate distance is:
Distance = Speed × Time

For the bus:
Distance_bus = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
Distance_car = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, we subtract the car's distance from the bus's distance to find out how much farther the bus went:
Distance_bus - Distance_car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of toys Sophie already had and then subtract that total from the new total number of toys, which is 62.

The number of building blocks is 31.
The number of stuffed animals is 8.
The number of stacking rings is 9.

Let's add these numbers together:

31 (building blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, we subtract the total number of toys Sophie had before the bouncy balls from the new total:

62 (total toys after buying bouncy balls) - 48 (total toys before buying bouncy balls) = 14

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as P, Pa, and J, respectively.

According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   P + Pa + J = 100

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   Pa = J + 10

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   P = Pa + J

We can substitute the second equation into the third to express Peter's age in terms of Jean's age:

P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now we can substitute the expressions for P and Pa from the second and third equations into the first equation:

(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
4J + 20 = 100
4J = 80
J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:

Pa = J + 10
Pa = 20 + 10
Pa = 30

And finally, we can find Peter's age:

P = Pa + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

So, Peter is 50 years old.

"To find the total number of water balloons, we can break down the problem into steps:

1. Maria initially gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons. So, the friends have a total of 4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons.
2. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.
3. Maria's mom then gave each person (Maria and her 4 friends, a total of 5 people) 3 more balloons. So, the mom gave a total of 5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 balloons.

Now, we add up all the balloons:

- Balloons from Maria's initial distribution: 8 balloons
- Balloons Maria had for herself: 1 balloon
- Balloons from Maria's mom: 15 balloons

Total balloons = 8 + 1 + 15 = 24

They also have 10 boxes of stuff already, so the total number of boxes is:
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

They can fit 2 boxes per table, so the total number of tables required is:
60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

They already own 15 tables, so the number of new tables they need is:
30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total revenue generated by each machine over the course of a month and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the daily production for each machine:

- Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day
- WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day

Next, we calculate the monthly production for each machine:

- Widgeteer 3000: 1440 widgets/day * 30 days = 43200 widgets/month
- WidgetMaster 9000: 1080 widgets/day * 30 days = 32400 widgets/month

Now, we calculate the monthly revenue for each machine:

- Widgeteer 3000: 43200 widgets/month * $6/widget = $259200/month
- WidgetMaster 9000: 32400 widgets/month * $6/widget = $194400/month

Finally, we find the difference in revenue:

- Difference: $259200/month - $194400/month = $64800/month

So, Fern will make $64800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month with 30 days.

"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. The first 12 hours are covered by the 1000 pesos charge. The additional 5 hours (17 hours - 12 hours) will be charged at 70 pesos per hour.

The cost for the additional hours is:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

The total cost for Cameron's stay is:
1000 pesos (for the first 12 hours) + 350 pesos (for the additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos

If Cameron had chosen the 24-hour stay, it would have cost him 1600 pesos. The amount of money Cameron saves by choosing the 12-hour stay plus the additional hours is:
1600 pesos (24-hour stay) - 1350 pesos (12-hour stay + additional hours) = 250 pesos

"To find out how many pounds of hay Nate needs, we first need to calculate the amount of hay required for the goats and the sheep separately, and then add the two amounts together.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Since there are 15 goats, the total amount of hay needed for the goats is:
15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds

Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that amount is:
2 * 5 pounds = 10 pounds

So each sheep needs 3 pounds less than 10 pounds, which is:
10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds

Since there are 12 sheep, the total amount of hay needed for the sheep is:
12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

Now, we add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:
75 pounds (for goats) + 84 pounds (for sheep) = 159 pounds

Therefore, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay.

"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:

Earnings = Hourly Rate * Hours Worked
Earnings = 50 dollars/hour * 6 hours
Earnings = 300 dollars

Next, we'll subtract the amount he spends on gas and the amount he wants to deposit in the bank:

Remaining Money = Earnings - Gas - Bank Deposit
Remaining Money = 300 dollars - 50 dollars - 100 dollars
Remaining Money = 150 dollars

Now, we'll calculate the total cost of the 5 pencils:

Cost of Pencils = Number of Pencils * Cost per Pencil
Cost of Pencils = 5 * 10 dollars
Cost of Pencils = 50 dollars

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:

Money After Pencils = Remaining Money - Cost of Pencils
Money After Pencils = 150 dollars - 50 dollars
Money After Pencils = 100 dollars

Finally, we'll determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the money he has left:

Number of Pens = Money After Pencils / Cost per Pen
Number of Pens = 100 dollars / 25 dollars/pen
Number of Pens = 4

John can buy 4 pens.

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has by redeeming all her coupons.
2. Calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice given to the students.
3. Subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles to find out how many bottles the teacher has left.

Step 1: Total number of bottles from coupons
The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice.
Total bottles = 9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Step 2: Total number of bottles given to students
There are 29 pupils, and each pupil gets 2 bottles of apple juice.
Total bottles given to students = 29 pupils * 2 bottles/pupil = 58 bottles

Step 3: Bottles left for the teacher
Bottles left for the teacher = Total bottles - Total bottles given to students
Bottles left for the teacher = 900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

"To determine how much money James was out, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs after the discount, then subtract the amount he received from selling the CDs he didn't like.

1. Calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:
   10 CDs * $15/CD = $150

2. Calculate the discount amount:
   40% of $150 = 0.40 * $150 = $60

3. Calculate the total cost of the CDs after the discount:
   $150 - $60 = $90

4. Calculate the amount James received from selling 5 CDs:
   5 CDs * $40/CD = $200

5. Since the amount he received from selling the CDs is more than the total cost after the discount, he actually made a profit. However, the question asks how much money he was out, which in this case is negative (he gained money).

   $90 (total cost) - $200 (amount received from selling) = -$110

Since the question asks for the amount of money he was out, and he actually gained money, the answer is that he was not out any money, but rather gained $110. However, if we strictly follow the question and provide a positive value for the amount he was out, we would say he was out $0.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. Calculate the distance James swims before resting.
2. Calculate the time it takes for him to swim that distance.
3. Calculate the time he rests.
4. Calculate the remaining distance he has to swim.
5. Calculate the time it takes for him to swim the remaining distance at half speed.
6. Add up all the times to get the total time.

Let's start with step 1:
James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is:
0.60 * 20 miles = 12 miles

Step 2:
James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, so the time to swim 12 miles is:
12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours

Step 3:
He rests for half as long as the swimming time, so the rest time is:
6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

Step 4:
The remaining distance to swim is:
20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles

Step 5:
James swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, which is:
2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour

The time to swim the remaining 8 miles is:
8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours

Step 6:
The total time to get across the lake is the sum of the time spent swimming the first part, resting, and swimming the second part:
6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:
17 hours

- The commission is 10% of $5, which is $5 * 0.10 = $0.50 per copy.
- For 6 copies, the total commission is 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Each copy costs $15.
- The commission is 8% of $15, which is $15 * 0.08 = $1.20 per copy.
- For 10 copies, the total commission is 10 * $1.20 = $12.00.

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati as B, by Azibo as A, and by Dinar as D. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. B + A + D = 45 (the total points scored by the team)
2. B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
3. B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

From the second equation, we can express A in terms of B:
A = B - 20

From the third equation, we can express D in terms of B:
D = B - 10

Now we can substitute A and D in the first equation with the expressions in terms of B:
B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45

Combine like terms:
3B - 30 = 45

Add 30 to both sides:
3B = 75

Divide by 3:
B = 25

Now that we know B, we can find A:
A = B - 20
A = 25 - 20
A = 5

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To find the number of pages in the book, we can use the information that there are 100 pages per inch of thickness. Since the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can calculate the total number of pages by multiplying the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book in inches.

100 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 150 pages

However, since each sheet of paper has printing on both sides, each sheet counts as two pages. The calculation above already takes this into account, as it is based on the number of pages, not the number of sheets.

Therefore, the book has 150 pages.

"To determine how many reports Vince can staple from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, we need to calculate the total time he spent stapling and then use his stapling rate to find the total number of reports.

First, let's calculate the total time in minutes:

- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.
- 15 hours is equal to 15 * 60 = 900 minutes.

Next, we need to determine how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:

- 900 minutes / 15 minutes per interval = 60 intervals.

Since Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can now calculate the total number of reports:

- 60 intervals * 30 reports per interval = 1800 reports.

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports.

"Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. In minutes, that is 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.

On the day in question, she was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes of time that she was not sleeping in her bed.

She also woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so instead of waking up at 6 a.m., she woke up at 5:55 a.m. This means she lost an additional 5 minutes of sleep.

The total time she lost from her usual sleep is 23 minutes (sleepwalking) + 5 minutes (waking up early) = 28 minutes.

"Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. If he has two dozen cups, that means he has 24 measuring cups (since one dozen equals 12).

To find out how many measuring spoons he has, we calculate 2/3 of 24:

\[ \text{Measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

So, Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons.

If he gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ \text{Measuring spoons remaining} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the number of measuring cups to the number of measuring spoons remaining:

\[ \text{Total utensils remaining} = \text{Measuring cups} + \text{Measuring spoons remaining} \]
\[ \text{Total utensils remaining} = 24 + 10 = 34 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial number of occupied beds.
2. Calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks.
3. Calculate the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks.
4. Subtract the total number of occupied beds from the hospital's capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds.

Step 1: Initial number of occupied beds
The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of them are occupied.
Initial occupied beds = 1000 * (1/5) = 200 beds

Step 2: Number of patients admitted over 2 weeks
There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 14 days.
Patients admitted each day = 50
Total patients admitted over 2 weeks = 50 * 14 = 700 patients

Step 3: Total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks
Total occupied beds = Initial occupied beds + Patients admitted over 2 weeks
Total occupied beds = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

Step 4: Number of unoccupied beds
Unoccupied beds = Hospital capacity - Total occupied beds
Unoccupied beds = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds

"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of non-work emails: 
   Total emails - Work emails = Non-work emails
   16 - 7 = 9 non-work emails

2. Calculate the number of emails to family:
   Two-thirds of the non-work emails are to family.
   (2/3) * 9 = 6 emails to family

3. Calculate the remaining emails after work and family emails:
   Non-work emails - Emails to family = Remaining emails
   9 - 6 = 3 remaining emails

4. Calculate the number of emails to her boyfriend:
   One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend.
   (1/3) * 3 = 1 email to her boyfriend

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"To find out how old Shawna's father is, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem.

1. Aliya is 3 years old.
2. Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya, so Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old.
3. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, so Shawna's father is 5 * 9 = 45 years old.

Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"If Courtney reported that the audience was 48 in number but overstated this by 20%, we can find the actual number of people who attended the concert by calculating what 100% (the actual number) would be.

Let's denote the actual number of people as \( x \). Courtney's report of 48 people is 120% of the actual number, because she overstated by 20%.

So we have the equation:

\[ 120\% \times x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we can convert 120% to a decimal and solve for \( x \):

\[ 1.20 \times x = 48 \]

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

The total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to first determine the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day, and then use the information that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day.

Let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:

- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes, so the net holes dug on the third day is 8 - 2 = 6 holes

Total holes by the end of the third day: 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes

Now, we know that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes, so four times that is:

4 * 10 = 40 holes

This means that by the end of the fourth day, there were 40 holes in total. Since there were 29 holes by the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:

40 (total holes by the end of the fourth day) - 29 (holes by the end of the third day) = 11 holes

So, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as A, by Stan as S, and by Alex as X.

According to the problem, we have the following equations:

1. The total number of Pokemon caught by all three is 339:
   A + S + X = 339

2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   X = S + 5

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught:
   S = 4A - 13

We can substitute the second equation into the first to eliminate X:

A + S + (S + 5) = 339
A + 2S + 5 = 339
A + 2S = 334

Now we can substitute the third equation into the above equation to eliminate S:

A + 2(4A - 13) = 334
A + 8A - 26 = 334
9A - 26 = 334
9A = 360
A = 40

Now that we have the value for A, we can find S:

S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to determine the total number of episodes and then multiply that by the length of each episode.

We know that each episode is 20 minutes long and that there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. This means that the number of episodes is 20 / 2, which is 10 episodes.

To find the total time spent watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

10 episodes * 20 minutes/episode = 200 minutes

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode.

"To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance the bird traveled in each direction and then sum the distances traveled southward, subtracting the distance traveled northward.

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
   Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 10 hours = 300 miles

2. The bird then flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
   Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 2 hours = 36 miles

3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
   Distance = Speed × Time = 22 mph × 5 hours = 110 miles

Now, we add the distances traveled south and subtract the distance traveled north to find the total distance between the two homes:

Total distance south = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles
Total distance north = 36 miles

Net distance between the homes = Total distance south - Total distance north
Net distance between the homes = 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles

"To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she had and then subtract the number of brownies that were eaten.

1. Greta made a batch of one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself.
2. She was sent home with 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office party.
3. Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting for her at the surprise party.
4. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.

First, we convert all the quantities to the same unit (individual brownies), knowing that one dozen equals 12 brownies.

- One dozen brownies = 12 brownies
- 1/2 a dozen brownies = 6 brownies
- Four dozen brownies = 48 brownies
- 1 1/2 dozen brownies eaten = 18 brownies

Now, we add up all the brownies Greta had:

12 (from herself) + 6 (from the office) + 48 (from the surprise party) = 66 brownies

Then, we subtract the number of brownies eaten:

66 (total brownies) - 18 (eaten) = 48 brownies

So, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.

"Nani's age is 8 years. His brother is twice his age, which means his brother is 16 years old. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. To find her age, we calculate 75% of 8 years, which is 0.75 * 8 = 6 years.

The total age of all three family members is the sum of their ages:
Nani's age + Brother's age + Sister's age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30

For polyester string racquets:
5 racquets * 22 minutes per racquet = 110 minutes

For hybrid set racquets:
4 racquets * 18 minutes per racquet = 72 minutes

Now, we add the time for all racquets together:
45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

Therefore, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets.

The first two phones are at full price:
2 phones * $600 = $1200

The next two phones are at half price:
2 phones * ($600 / 2) = 2 phones * $300 = $600

Now, we add the cost of the first two phones to the cost of the last two phones to get the total cost:
$1200 + $600 = $1800

So, John paid a total of $1800 for all the phones.

"To find out how many wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:

P = 2 * (length + width)

Given that the length (L) is 15 feet and the width (W) is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2 * (15 + 10)
P = 2 * 25
P = 50 feet

Now that we know the perimeter is 50 feet, and Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we can calculate the total number of wood slats (S) needed:

S = P * 2
S = 50 * 2
S = 100

Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

"Mrs. Harrington initially had 12 boxes of oranges. She gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes. So, she was left with 12 - 4 = 8 boxes.

Each box contains 20 oranges, so 8 boxes contain 8 * 20 = 160 oranges.

She then kept 1/4 of the oranges, which means she kept 160 * 1/4 = 40 oranges.

The rest of the oranges, which she sold, would be 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

Half of the USA's states: 50 / 2 = 25
India's states: 25 + 4 = 29

Now, we add the number of states in both countries together:

USA states + India states = 50 + 29 = 79

The total number of states in both countries together is 79.

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford his books, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books and then determine how much more money he needs after accounting for the money he has already saved.

The total cost of the books is:
$18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (cookbook) = $39

Tyler has already saved $14, so the additional amount he needs is:
$39 (total cost) - $14 (saved) = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so the number of hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25 is:
$25 (needed) / $5 (per hour) = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, so Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.
3. The total number of cherries is 60, so the number of cherries Jerry has is 60 - (Robert's cherries + Richard's cherries) = 60 - (30 + 20) = 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.

Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10 = 20

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let Gs be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday.
- Let Ps be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.
- Let Gs+5 be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday (since he sold 5 more boxes on Sunday than on Saturday).
- Let Ps+4 be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday (since he sold 4 fewer boxes on Sunday than on Saturday).

From the problem, we know:
- Gs = 10 (Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread on Saturday)
- Ps = Gs - 4 (Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Saturday than gingerbread)
- Gs+5 = 10 + 5 = 15 (Sunny sold 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday)
- Ps+4 = 15 (Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie on Sunday)

Now we can calculate the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday:
- Ps = 10 - 4 = 6 (Sunny sold 6 boxes of apple pie on Saturday)

Next, we calculate the earnings for each day:
- Earnings from gingerbread on Saturday: Gs * $6 = 10 * $6 = $60
- Earnings from apple pie on Saturday: Ps * $15 = 6 * $15 = $90
- Earnings from gingerbread on Sunday: (Gs+5) * $6 = 15 * $6 = $90
- Earnings from apple pie on Sunday: 15 * $15 = $225

Finally, we add up the earnings from both days:
- Total earnings = Earnings from Saturday + Earnings from Sunday
- Total earnings = ($60 + $90) + ($90 + $225)
- Total earnings = $150 + $315
- Total earnings = $465

So, Sunny earned a total of $465 for the two days.

1. Calculate the total amount of sunscreen used per day: Since Pamela reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour and she will be outside for 4 hours a day, she will use 4 ounces of sunscreen per day.
2. Calculate the total amount of sunscreen used over 8 days: If she uses 4 ounces a day, over 8 days she will use 4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces.
3. Determine the number of 8-ounce bottles needed: Since each bottle contains 8 ounces, we divide the total amount of sunscreen needed by the amount in each bottle: 32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles.

Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen for her vacation.

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 24 - 19 = 5 years older than he is now.
3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad. So, his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.
4. Since Emil will be 24 and that is twice the age of his brother, his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old at that time.
5. To find out the current age of Emil's brother, we subtract 5 years (the time until Emil is 24) from 12, which gives us 12 - 5 = 7 years old.
6. To find out the current age of Emil's dad, we also subtract 5 years from 48, which gives us 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the width of the flowers from inches to feet.
2. Calculate the total space each plant, including the space between them, will occupy.
3. Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed.
4. Subtract the number of plants Pat already owns from the total number needed.
5. Calculate the cost of the additional plants needed.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Each flower grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot (since 12 inches = 1 foot).

2. Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between them, so the total space each plant will occupy is:
   1 foot (width of the plant) + 1.5 feet (space between plants) = 2.5 feet per plant.

3. To find out how many plants can fit in the 111-foot-long flower bed, we divide the length of the flower bed by the space each plant occupies:
   111 feet / 2.5 feet per plant = 44.4 plants.
   Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

4. Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional plants needed is:
   44 plants - 17 plants = 27 plants.

5. Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:
   27 plants * $6 per plant = $162.

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations, and then subtract that from the total amount of soil available.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they are planting 4 sunflowers, so the total soil used for sunflowers is:
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they are planting 10 carnations, so the total soil used for carnations is:
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

The total soil used for both sunflowers and carnations is:
12 pounds (for sunflowers) + 15 pounds (for carnations) = 27 pounds

The 30-pound bag of soil minus the 27 pounds used for sunflowers and carnations leaves:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

So, they can plant 3 roses.

"To determine the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to calculate the time required for each task separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp:
Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, it will take:
90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes to saute 90 shrimp:
Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to saute 90 shrimp, it will take:
90 shrimp / 30 shrimp per 10 minutes = 3 * 10 minutes = 30 minutes

Now, we add the time for peeling and the time for sauteing to get the total time:

2. On high for 4 hours: The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   Temperature change = 4 hours * -3 degrees/hour = -12 degrees

3. Off for 2 hours: The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   Temperature change = 2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees

Now, we add up all the temperature changes to find the final temperature change from the starting temperature.

Total temperature change = -6 degrees (low) + -12 degrees (high) + 4 degrees (off)
Total temperature change = -18 degrees + 4 degrees
Total temperature change = -14 degrees

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Bill's dad saw Comet Halley when he was 30 years old.
2. Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the next time the comet would be visible would be 75 years after the dad saw it.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. So, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet the second time.
4. Since the comet appears every 75 years, and Bill saw it when he was 90, the first time he saw the comet would have been 75 years earlier, when he was 90 - 75 = 15 years old.

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to add up the checks for each category:

- Electric bill: 1 check per month × 12 months = 12 checks per year
- Gas bill: 1 check per month × 12 months = 12 checks per year
- Church: 2 checks per month × 12 months = 24 checks per year
- Pest and lawn service: 1 check per quarter × 4 quarters = 4 checks per year

Now, we add them all together:

12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks per year

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day and then calculate how many of those are to France.

Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \).

According to the problem, the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can write:

\[ \frac{1}{2} F = 44 \]

Solving for \( F \), we get:

\[ F = 44 \times 2 \]
\[ F = 88 \]

So, the first plane makes 88 flights in a day.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \]

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. The number of remaining flights is:

\[ 88 - 66 = 22 \]

Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:

\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Therefore, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum them up.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add up the durations of their howls:
20 (Tobias) + 40 (Chikote) + 60 (Igneous) = 120 seconds.

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert the total seconds to minutes:
120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.

"Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: \( A = 3 \) years
- Alessandro: \( L = 4 \) years
- Helene: \( H \) years
- Wilfred: \( W \) years

The total age of the children is given as 20 years, so we can write the equation:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known ages of Akbar and Alessandro, we get:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

We are also told that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So the average age is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we have:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 \]
\[ H = 10 \]

Now we can substitute Helene's age into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 13 - 10 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, Wilfred is 3 years old.

"To find out how many people were in the church next door, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests.
2. Determine how many cookies were given to the church.
3. Calculate how many people in the church received 15 cookies each.

Step 1: Total number of cookies
There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies.
Total cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

Step 2: Cookies given to the church
The bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church.
Cookies given to the church = 1/2 * 1500 cookies = 750 cookies

Step 3: Number of people in the church
Each person in the church received 15 cookies.
Number of people = 750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

So, the number of people in the church next door is 50.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a ratio to represent the distribution of the watermelon slices. Let's say each kid's slice is represented by 1 unit. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be 2 units.

There are 4 kids, so the total units for the kids' slices are:
4 kids * 1 unit/kid = 4 units

There are 2 adults, so the total units for the adults' slices are:
2 adults * 2 units/adult = 4 units

The total units of the watermelon are the sum of the kids' and adults' units:
4 units (kids) + 4 units (adults) = 8 units

Each adult gets 2 units out of the total 8 units. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the following formula:

(Units per adult / Total units) * 100%

So for each adult, the percentage is:
(2 units / 8 units) * 100% = 25%

"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he will spend on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from his total available time at the clinic.

First, let's calculate the time spent on rounds:
- He has 9 inpatients and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient.
- 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on appointments:
- He has 10 appointments and each takes 30 minutes.
- 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.

Now, let's convert the total time spent on rounds and appointments into hours:
- 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.
- 480 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 8 hours.

Finally, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total available time:
- 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records.

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up all the time required for each step and then subtract that total from the time she wants to serve the cake.

The total time required is:
- 20 minutes to make the cake batter
- 30 minutes to bake the cake
- 2 hours to cool the cake
- 10 minutes to frost the cake

Let's convert all the times to minutes for easier calculation:
- 20 minutes (batter)
- 30 minutes (baking)
- 2 hours = 120 minutes (cooling)
- 10 minutes (frosting)

Now, let's add up the total time in minutes:
20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours.

Jordan wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm. To find the latest time she can start, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( x \) represent the number of chocolate bars in a box.

Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold \( 64 \) chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:

\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by \( 8 \):

\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]

\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the following:

1. The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
2. The cost per student per session is $1.50.
3. There are 10 students.
4. The studio is rented 3 days a week.
5. We will assume a month has approximately 4 weeks for this calculation.

First, we calculate the total cost per session:
- Studio rental cost per session: $25
- Cost per student per session: $1.50 * 10 students = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40

Next, we calculate the total cost per week:
- Total cost per session * 3 sessions per week = $40 * 3 = $120

Then, we calculate the total cost per month:
- Total cost per week * 4 weeks per month = $120 * 4 = $480

However, the question asks for the expected earnings, which typically means the revenue, not the cost. If the question is asking for the revenue, we need to know the price charged per student per session, which is not provided. If the question is asking for the total cost (which is the amount the studio would need to earn to break even), then the answer is:

"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we need to first determine how many chocolate bars are in each of their boxes.

Let's start with Peter. If Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars, we can find the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:

Number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes = Total chocolate bars / Number of boxes
Number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes = 64 / 4
Number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes = 16

Now, let's do the same for Martha. If Martha has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars, we can find the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes by dividing her total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:

Number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes = Total chocolate bars / Number of boxes
Number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes = 56 / 7
Number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes = 8

Now we can find the difference in the number of chocolate bars between each of Peter's boxes and each of Martha's boxes:

Difference = Number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes - Number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes
Difference = 16 - 8
Difference = 8

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"To find out how many porcupines will be in the park after a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of female porcupines.
2. Determine the number of babies born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of babies born in a year.
4. Add the total number of babies born in a year to the initial population to get the final population.

Step 1: Calculate the number of female porcupines.
The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population of 50.
Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Step 2: Determine the number of babies born each month.
Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
Babies born each month = Number of female porcupines * 4
Babies born each month = 30 * 4 = 120

Step 3: Calculate the total number of babies born in a year.
There are 12 months in a year.
Total babies born in a year = Babies born each month * 12
Total babies born in a year = 120 * 12 = 1440

Step 4: Add the total number of babies born in a year to the initial population.
Final population = Initial population + Total babies born in a year
Final population = 50 + 1440 = 1490

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons using the given conversion factor.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons and the cost per gallon.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.
The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume (V) can be calculated using the formula:
V = length × width × depth

V = 25 feet × 14 feet × 4 feet
V = 1400 cubic feet

Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.
The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons.

Gallons = V × 5.9
Gallons = 1400 cubic feet × 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Step 3: Calculate the cost.
The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon.

Cost = Gallons × $0.10
Cost = 8260 gallons × $0.10
Cost = $826

The cost to fill the pool will be $826.

"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each of them traveled and then subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance.

The formula to calculate distance is:
Distance = Speed × Time

For Matteo:
Distance_Matteo = Speed_Matteo × Time_Matteo
Distance_Matteo = 55 mph × 4 hours
Distance_Matteo = 220 miles

For Shandy:
Distance_Shandy = Speed_Shandy × Time_Shandy
Distance_Shandy = 45 mph × 10 hours
Distance_Shandy = 450 miles

Now, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove:
Distance_Shandy - Distance_Matteo = 450 miles - 220 miles
Distance_Shandy - Distance_Matteo = 230 miles

Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

"To find the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into parts and calculate the number of female students in each age group.

First, we determine the number of students over 16 years old and the number of students under 16 years old:
- Students over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500
- Students under 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500

Next, we calculate the number of male students in each age group:
- Male students over 16 years old: 1500 / 4 = 375
- Male students under 16 years old: 1500 / 2 = 750

Now, we can find the number of female students in each age group by subtracting the number of male students from the total number of students in each age group:
- Female students over 16 years old: 1500 - 375 = 1125
- Female students under 16 years old: 1500 - 750 = 750

Finally, we add the number of female students from both age groups to get the total number of female students:
- Total female students: 1125 + 750 = 1875

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps in one hour.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps in one hour.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps in one hour.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

10 (Bethany's laps) - 5 (Quinn's laps) = 5

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water pumped into the tank on both days and then subtract that from the tank's total capacity to find out how much water is remaining.

First, let's calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:

- Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity on the first day:
  \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons

- Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda on the first day:
  \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons

Now, let's calculate the amount of water they pumped on the second day:

- Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day:
  \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons

- Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day:
  \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons

Now, let's add up all the water pumped into the tank over the two days:

- Total water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on the first day:
  \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons

- Total water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on the second day:
  \( 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \) gallons

- Total water pumped into the tank over the two days:
  \( 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \) gallons

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity to find out how much water is remaining:

- Water remaining to fill the tank:
  \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons

So, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is:

"To find out the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

First, we need to account for the 3 hours where the power bank was losing 7% of its total capacity each hour. If the power bank lost 7% per hour, then each hour it retained 93% (100% - 7%) of its charge. To find the charge before these 3 hours, we can divide the final charge by 0.93 three times (once for each hour).

Let's calculate the charge before the last 3 hours:

28% / 0.93 = 30.11% (after 2 hours of 7% loss)
30.11% / 0.93 = 32.37% (after 1 hour of 7% loss)
32.37% / 0.93 = 34.80% (initial charge before 7% loss started)

Next, we need to account for the 5 hours where the power bank was losing 9% of its total capacity each hour. If the power bank lost 9% per hour, then each hour it retained 91% (100% - 9%) of its charge. To find the charge before these 5 hours, we can divide the charge we just calculated by 0.91 five times (once for each hour).

Let's calculate the charge before the first 5 hours:

34.80% / 0.91 = 38.24% (after 4 hours of 9% loss)
38.24% / 0.91 = 42.02% (after 3 hours of 9% loss)
42.02% / 0.91 = 46.18% (after 2 hours of 9% loss)
46.18% / 0.91 = 50.75% (after 1 hour of 9% loss)
50.75% / 0.91 = 55.77% (initial charge before 9% loss started)

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 55.77%.

"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to save, which is 20% of $10,000.

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Next, we need to determine how much Janet earns in a week. She makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, which totals $25 an hour. If she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

$25/hour * 40 hours/week = $1,000/week

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for her to save $2,000, which is the amount needed for the down payment.

$2,000 / $1,000/week = 2 weeks

"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased.

The cost of 3 peaches at $0.50 each is:
3 * $0.50 = $1.50

The cost of 4 pears at $0.50 each is:
4 * $0.50 = $2.00

The cost of 2 kiwis at $1.00 each is:
2 * $1.00 = $2.00

The cost of 5 apples at $0.75 each is:
5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, we add up the total cost of these fruits:
$1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the remaining amount he has after these purchases is:
$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( L = 3S \) and \( S = 4 \) dollars.

Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals sold as \( x \) and the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( y \). The problem states that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so \( x = 2y \).

The total earnings from the sales are given as $120, which can be represented by the equation:
\[ xS + yL = 120 \]

Substituting \( S = 4 \) and \( L = 3S = 12 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 4x + 12y = 120 \]

Since \( x = 2y \), we can substitute \( 2y \) for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 4(2y) + 12y = 120 \]
\[ 8y + 12y = 120 \]
\[ 20y = 120 \]
\[ y = 6 \]

Now, we can find \( x \) by substituting \( y \) back into \( x = 2y \):
\[ x = 2(6) \]
\[ x = 12 \]

So, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in a day, and then multiply that by the number of dwarves and the number of days in the month.

1. First, we find out how much a dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe:
   - A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so:
     12 pounds/day * 2 = 24 pounds/day

2. Next, we calculate how much a dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe:
   - A steel pickaxe allows a dwarf to mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so:
     24 pounds/day * 1.5 = 36 pounds/day

3. Now we calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves in one day with steel pickaxes:
   - 40 dwarves * 36 pounds/day = 1440 pounds/day

4. Finally, we find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days:
   - 1440 pounds/day * 30 days = 43200 pounds

So, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days is 43200 pounds.

"To find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can use the information that the prices are proportional. This means that the cost per sandwich is the same for all package sizes.

Let's calculate the cost per sandwich for the first two packages:

- For the first package, the cost per sandwich is $3 / 2 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich.
- For the second package, the cost per sandwich is $6 / 4 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich.

Since the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich for the third package should also be $1.50. Therefore, the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches is:

- 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12.

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

"Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old bedroom set for $1000. This means he has to pay the difference, which is $3000 - $1000 = $2000 for the new bedroom set. He has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month. 

To find out how much he has to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

10% of $2000 = 0.10 * $2000 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sally starts with 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons.
2. 40% of the red balloons burst, so she loses 40% of 25, which is 10 red balloons. She now has 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.
3. She releases half of the yellow balloons, so she loses 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. She now has 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.
4. She finds 8 blue balloons and adds 75% of them to her clutch. 75% of 8 is 6, so she adds 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's add up the remaining balloons:

- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7 (none were lost or released)
- Yellow balloons: 6
- Blue balloons: 6

Total balloons Sally carries into the school: 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios where he would not have to turn it in and then subtract that from 100%.

1. There's a 50% chance that Marcus will have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework.
2. If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. This means there's a 50% * 40% = 20% chance that the normal teacher will give an extension.
3. If the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension (50% * 60% = 30% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. This means there's a 30% * 20% = 6% chance that Marcus will get a personal extension.

Now, we add up all the probabilities where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
- 50% (substitute teacher)
- 20% (normal teacher gives an extension)
- 6% (Marcus gets a personal extension)

The total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework is 50% + 20% + 6% = 76%.

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is 100% - 76% = 24%.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats available for friends and family by subtracting the seats for graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.
2. Divide the number of seats available for friends and family by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.

Let's do the math:

Total seats in the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300

Seats available for friends and family = Total seats - Seats for graduates - Seats for faculty
Seats available for friends and family = 6000 - 950 - 300
Seats available for friends and family = 4750

Now, we divide the seats available for friends and family by the number of graduates:

Tickets per graduate = Seats available for friends and family / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

Each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to follow the given relationships:

1. Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans.
2. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, so he can eat 75 * 2 = 150 medium-sized beans.
3. Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, so to find out how many small beans he can eat, we multiply the number of medium-sized beans by 3.

So, Grandpa can eat 150 * 3 = 450 small beans.

"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to calculate her total earnings and subtract her total expenses, then divide by the total number of hours she spent on jury duty.

First, we calculate her total earnings:
Earnings per day = $15
Total earnings for 3 days = $15 * 3 = $45

Next, we calculate her total expenses:
Parking cost per day = $3
Total parking cost for 3 days = $3 * 3 = $9

Now, we subtract her total expenses from her total earnings to find her net earnings:
Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = $45 - $9 = $36

Finally, we calculate her pay per hour:
Total hours spent = 6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours
Pay per hour after expenses = Net earnings / Total hours spent
Pay per hour after expenses = $36 / 18 hours = $2

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the number of soda bottles he will place and the time it will take to move between them.

First, we calculate the number of soda bottles. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of bottles is:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

However, since he starts at the first bottle, he will only need to move between the bottles, which means he will move 7 times (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, until the 7th to the 8th).

Each move takes 5 seconds, so the total time to move between all the bottles is:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 35 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Jim's education, including the loans and the income he did not earn while in college. Then we need to determine how long it will take for him to earn that amount with his new, higher salary.

1. Calculate the total amount of loans:
   $50,000 per year * 4 years = $200,000

2. Calculate the income not earned while in college:
   $25,000 per year * 4 years = $100,000

3. Calculate the total cost of college:
   $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000

4. Calculate Jim's new income after college:
   $25,000 (old income) * 3 = $75,000 (new income)

5. Calculate the additional income per year after college:
   $75,000 (new income) - $25,000 (old income) = $50,000 (additional income per year)

6. Calculate how long it will take to earn the money equivalent to the total cost of college:
   $300,000 (total cost) / $50,000 (additional income per year) = 6 years

So, it will take Jim 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To find out how much fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he will be using. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet, and Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of the fabric piece will be:
6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of the fabric piece will be:
8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we can calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
8 feet (length) * 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered on each day and then sum them up.

1. On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.
2. On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. One-fifth of Monday's delivery is \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \) letters. So, on Tuesday, they delivered \( 85 + 17 = 102 \) letters.
3. On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice Tuesday's delivery is \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \) letters. So, on Wednesday, they delivered \( 204 + 5 = 209 \) letters.

Now, we add the letters delivered on each day to find the total:

"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. On the first race, he lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. That means he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $10 + $1 = $11.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. That means he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- First race loss: $5
- Second race gain: -$11 (since it's a win, it reduces the total loss)
- Third race loss: $16.50

Total loss = $5 - $11 + $16.50 = $11.50

Since there were 3 races, we divide the total loss by 3 to find the average loss per race:
Average loss = $11.50 / 3

Now, let's calculate the average loss:
Average loss = $3.83 (rounded to two decimal places)

Xavier's original height is 4 feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert Xavier's height to inches:
4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's original height is 50 inches and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his new height is:

"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \). According to the problem:

- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x = 1920 - 240 \]
\[ 4x = 1680 \]
\[ x = \frac{1680}{4} \]
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420.

"To find out how many hours of work each painter put in, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide that by the number of painters.

First, we need to determine how many days the painters worked. Since they worked for 3 weeks and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days is:

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Next, we need to find out how many hours they worked each day. A full day is typically 24 hours, but they only worked 3/8ths of a day, so:

3/8 * 24 hours/day = 9 hours/day

Now, we can calculate the total hours worked by the team over the 21 days:

9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by the number of painters to find out how many hours each painter worked:

189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours

Each painter put in 47.25 hours of work.

"Let's denote the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \). According to the problem:

- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:

\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:

\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:

\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x \), the number of balls retrieved in the second set, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set of the match.

"James receives 80 emails a day, and 20% of those emails do not require a response. This means that 80% of the emails do require a response.

To find out how many emails require a response, we calculate 80% of 80 emails:

\( 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \) emails per day.

Since James works a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:

\( 64 \times 5 = 320 \) emails in a 5-day work week.

"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to add the number of classes that visited each day.

- Monday: 32 classes
- Tuesday: Twice as many as Monday, so 32 * 2 = 64 classes
- Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, so 32 * 3 = 96 classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, we add all these numbers together:

32 (Monday) + 64 (Tuesday) + 96 (Wednesday) + 30 (Thursday) + 25 (Friday) = 247

"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we need to add up all his scores and then divide by the number of tests.

The total score for the first 3 tests is 100 each, so:
100 + 100 + 100 = 300

The score for the 4th test is 80.

Adding the 4th test score to the total:
300 + 80 = 380

Now, we divide the total score by the number of tests to find the average:
380 / 4 = 95

John's average score across the 4 tests is 95.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by both the glee club and the football team, and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered by both groups.

First, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club:
- The glee club ordered 20 pizzas.
- They ate 70% of them, which is 0.70 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

Next, we calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team:
- The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.
- They ate 80% of them, which is 0.80 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

Now, we calculate the total number of pizzas ordered and the total number of pizzas eaten:
- Total pizzas ordered = 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.
- Total pizzas eaten = 14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas.

Finally, we find the number of pizzas left by subtracting the total eaten from the total ordered:
- Pizzas left = Total pizzas ordered - Total pizzas eaten = 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

"To find out how much Anthony spends on postage, we need to calculate the cost for both the small and big coupons and then add them together.

First, we calculate the number of big coupons:
- Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, so he will send out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons.

Next, we calculate the cost for the small coupons:
- Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

Then, we calculate the cost for the big coupons:
- Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

Finally, we add the costs together to get the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of small coupons + cost of big coupons = 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:
- Total cost in dollars = 24500 cents / 100 = $245.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sidney initially ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.
2. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so Sidney was left with 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches.
3. Sidney then ordered another three sub sandwiches, which means Sidney now has 3 + 3 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches.
4. Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24 meatballs.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of fertiliser that was successfully delivered to the farmers after accounting for the trucks that had mechanical failures.

1. First, we determine the number of trucks that had mechanical failures:
   A quarter of the 20 trucks had mechanical failures, so:
   \( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \) trucks had mechanical failures.

2. Next, we calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser:
   \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) trucks successfully delivered the fertiliser.

3. Each of these 15 trucks was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, so the total amount of fertiliser delivered is:
   \( 15 \times 20 = 300 \) tons.

The total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300.

"Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter to make 6 dozen croissants, as he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.

The promotion at the grocery store is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter Dennis buys at full price, he gets the next pound at half price.

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. For the first pound, he pays $4.00, and for the second pound, he pays $2.00 (half off). This pattern repeats for every two pounds of butter he buys.

So, for 6 pounds of butter, the cost will be:
- 1st pound: $4.00
- 2nd pound: $2.00
- 3rd pound: $4.00
- 4th pound: $2.00
- 5th pound: $4.00
- 6th pound: $2.00

Adding these up, the total cost is:

"To calculate the total cost of Kayla's birthday party, we need to determine the number of guests and then apply the pricing structure provided.

First, let's calculate the total number of guests Kayla invited:
- 25 classmates
- 7 girls from her dance class

Total invited guests = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who said they could not come:
Total attending guests = 45 - 4 = 41

The theater has a base fee for 20 guests and charges an additional fee for each guest beyond that. Since Kayla has 41 guests, we need to calculate the cost for the 21 additional guests (41 - 20 = 21).

The cost for the additional guests is 21 guests * $6/guest = $126

Now, we add the base fee to the additional guest fee to get the total cost:
Total cost = Base fee + Additional guest fee
Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251

The total cost for the party is $251.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we can start by calculating the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys each day and then subtract that from the total daily consumption of all three monkeys.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, which is 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Together, the first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day.

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for a week, the total daily consumption for all three monkeys is 315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day.

The third monkey eats the rest of the bananas, which is the total daily consumption minus the amount eaten by the first two monkeys:
45 bananas per day - 24 bananas per day = 21 bananas per day.

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses Jenny bought and then determine how much change she should receive in quarters.

First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since a dozen (12) roses cost $15, we can find the cost of 15 roses by calculating the cost of 12 roses and the cost of the remaining 3 roses.

Cost of 12 roses: $15
Cost of 3 roses: 3 * $2 = $6

Total cost of 15 roses: $15 + $6 = $21

Jenny arrived with five 5 dollar bills, which means she had:

5 * $5 = $25

Now, we subtract the total cost of the roses from the amount of money Jenny had:

$25 - $21 = $4

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:

$4 * 4 quarters/dollar = 16 quarters

Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend paid for the watch.
3. Determine the discount Mr. Rogers' friend received from the original price.
4. Calculate the percentage discount based on the original price.

Step 1: Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price.
Original price of the watch = $2000
Price Mr. Rogers paid = 75% of $2000 = 0.75 * $2000 = $1500

Step 2: Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he paid.
Price Mr. Rogers' friend paid = 120% of $1500 = 1.20 * $1500 = $1800

Step 3: Determine the discount Mr. Rogers' friend received from the original price.
Discount = Original price - Price Mr. Rogers' friend paid = $2000 - $1800 = $200

Step 4: Calculate the percentage discount based on the original price.
Percentage discount = (Discount / Original price) * 100 = ($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%

The percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%.

"To find out how many jellyfish 5 springs would create in 4 hours, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Determine how many seconds are in 4 hours.
2. Calculate how many jellyfish one spring would create in that time.
3. Multiply that number by 5 to account for all the springs.

Step 1: There are 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 4 hours in total.
So, the total number of seconds in 4 hours is:
60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Step 2: If one spring creates one jellyfish every second, then in 14400 seconds, one spring would create:

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the cost of the bananas both ways and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually:
- Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch averages 4 bananas.
- So, the total number of bananas is 10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas.
- The cost of one banana is $0.80.
- Therefore, the cost of 40 bananas is 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches:
- Jenny buys 10 bunches at $3.00 per bunch.
- Therefore, the cost of 10 bunches is 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00.

Now, we can find the savings by subtracting the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount Harry gets as \( H \).

According to the problem, we have two equations:

1. \( S + H = 100 \) (the total amount of fence)
2. \( H = S + 60 \) (Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( S \):

\( S + (S + 60) = 100 \)
\( 2S + 60 = 100 \)
\( 2S = 100 - 60 \)
\( 2S = 40 \)
\( S = 20 \)

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply by their respective prices.

First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes sold: 50% of 300 = 0.5 * 300 = 150
- BMX bikes sold: 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
- MTB bikes sold: The rest of the bikes, which is 300 - (150 + 45) = 300 - 195 = 105

Now, let's calculate the earnings from each type of bike:

- Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * ($500 / 2) = 45 * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

"To find out how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class during the week and then add the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's calculate the total minutes John spends in class during the week:

- A normal student has 6 periods a day, each 40 minutes long, so a normal student spends 6 * 40 = 240 minutes a day in class.
- John has 2 extra classes, so he spends an additional 2 * 40 = 80 minutes a day in class.
- Therefore, John spends 240 + 80 = 320 minutes a day in class.
- Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes a week in class.

Next, let's calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:

- John spends 1/16 of his weekly class minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.
- So, the extra learning time each day is 1600 / 16 = 100 minutes.
- Therefore, the total extra learning time for both days is 100 * 2 = 200 minutes.

Now, let's add the class time and the extra learning time to get the total weekly learning time:

- Total weekly learning time in minutes is 1600 (class time) + 200 (extra learning) = 1800 minutes.

Finally, we convert the total minutes to hours:

- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 1800 minutes is 1800 / 60 = 30 hours.

Therefore, John spends 30 hours a week learning.

"To calculate the cost of painting the room, we first need to determine the total area that needs to be painted. We can do this by calculating the area of each wall and then summing them up.

The north and south walls are 10 feet wide by 8 feet high, so each of these walls has an area of:
10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet

Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

The east and west walls are 5 feet wide by 8 feet high, so each of these walls has an area of:

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial charge of $85.00.
2. Subtract the cost of the returned item, which is $15.00.
3. Calculate the discounted price of the frying pan, which is 20% off $20.00.
4. Calculate the discounted price of the set of towels, which is 10% off $30.00.
5. Add the discounted prices of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance after the return.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. After return: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00
3. Frying pan discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
   Frying pan price after discount: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00
4. Towels discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
   Towels price after discount: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00
5. New balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00.

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

We are told that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on, so we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 15:

\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

"To find Caroline's age, we first need to determine Ben's age based on Chris's age, and then use Ben's age to find Caroline's age.

Given that Chris is 4 years old and Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age as follows:
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben is 8 years old, and Caroline is three times older than Ben, we can calculate Caroline's age:
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

So, Caroline is 24 years old.

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work to save for a 20-year retirement, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount.

1. Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs for retirement:
   40% of her current annual salary is $100,000 * 0.40 = $40,000 per year.

2. Calculate the total amount needed for 20 years of retirement:
   $40,000 per year * 20 years = $800,000.

3. Calculate the amount Lauren saves from each paycheck:
   She saves 20% of her current annual salary, which is $100,000 * 0.20 = $20,000 per year.

4. Determine how many years it will take to save the total amount needed:
   Total amount needed / Amount saved per year = $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for a 20-year retirement at 40% of her current annual salary.

"To find the length of each final cut, we first need to determine the length of the 4 equal parts Marty will cut the ribbon into. We do this by dividing the total length of the ribbon by 4.

100 centimeters / 4 = 25 centimeters

Each of these 25 centimeter parts will then be divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 centimeters by 5.

25 centimeters / 5 = 5 centimeters

So, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long.

"If 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can find the total population of the school by using the following calculation:

Let \( P \) be the total population of the school. Then, 40% of \( P \) is equal to 240 boys.

\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:

\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

Now that we know the total population of the school is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = P - \text{Number of boys} \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

So, the number of girls in the school is 360.

"To find the average height of the heels at the cocktail party, you can add the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of women.

There are three women wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for the 4-inch heels is:
3 women * 4 inches/woman = 12 inches

There are three women wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for the 2-inch heels is:
3 women * 2 inches/woman = 6 inches

The total height of all the heels is:
12 inches + 6 inches = 18 inches

The total number of women is:
3 women + 3 women = 6 women

The average height of the heels is the total height divided by the number of women:
18 inches / 6 women = 3 inches

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her 9,300-mile journey in June, we first need to calculate the total number of miles she plans to hike with her current plan and then find the difference between her goal and her current plan.

June has 30 days. If Soledad hikes 125 miles twice a day, she will hike:

125 miles/hike * 2 hikes/day = 250 miles/day

Now, let's calculate the total miles she will hike in June with her current plan:

250 miles/day * 30 days = 7,500 miles

Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles. The difference between her goal and her current plan is:

9,300 miles - 7,500 miles = 1,800 miles

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the additional miles needed by the number of days in June:

1,800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles/day

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"To calculate the total miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the one-way distance to his parents' house.
2. Double that distance to account for the round trip.
3. Multiply the round trip distance by the number of visits per month.

Step 1: One-way distance
Since it takes John 2 hours to drive to his parents' house at a speed of 70 mph, we can calculate the one-way distance using the formula:
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles

Step 2: Round trip distance
The round trip distance is twice the one-way distance:
Round trip distance = 140 miles × 2 = 280 miles

Step 3: Monthly distance
John visits his parents twice a month, so the total monthly distance is:
Monthly distance = Round trip distance × Number of visits per month
Monthly distance = 280 miles × 2 = 560 miles

Therefore, John drives 560 miles a month when visiting his parents.

"To find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we can first calculate the total number of toys produced by the other four workers during their 10-hour shift.

The two workers who produce 6 toys an hour will each produce:
6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 60 toys

Since there are two of them, together they produce:
60 toys * 2 = 120 toys

The other two workers who produce 4 toys an hour will each produce:
4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 40 toys

Since there are two of them, together they produce:
40 toys * 2 = 80 toys

The total number of toys produced by the four workers is:
120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys

The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to complete the order of 400 toys, which means that the four workers and the fifth worker together produced:
400 toys - 20 toys = 380 toys

Since the four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
380 toys - 200 toys = 180 toys

The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys/hour

Now, we add the weights of all three dogs together:
Kory's dog: 60 pounds
Elijah's first dog: 15 pounds
Elijah's second dog: 30 pounds

60 + 15 + 30 = 105 pounds

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as V.

According to the problem, two years ago Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so we can write the equation:

14 = 2 * V

Now we solve for V:

V = 14 / 2
V = 7

This means that Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find out how old Vince is now, we add 2 years to his age at that time:

Vince's current age = V + 2
Vince's current age = 7 + 2
Vince's current age = 9

So, Vince is 9 years old now.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's call the number of eggs each of them painted ""A"".
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's call the number of eggs Camden painted ""C"" and the number of eggs Sarah painted ""S"".
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so we can write this as C = S + 12.
4. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56, so we can write this as A + A + C + S = 56, or 2A + C + S = 56.

Now we can substitute the value of C from step 3 into the equation from step 4:

2A + (S + 12) + S = 56
2A + 2S + 12 = 56
2A + 2S = 56 - 12
2A + 2S = 44
A + S = 22

Since we know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs (C + S = 30), we can substitute C = S + 12 into this equation:

(S + 12) + S = 30
2S + 12 = 30
2S = 30 - 12
2S = 18
S = 9

Now that we know Sarah painted 9 eggs, we can find out how many Camden painted:

C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Now we can find out how many eggs Arnold painted by using the equation A + S = 22:

A + 9 = 22
A = 22 - 9
A = 13

Finally, we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:

C - A = 21 - 13
C - A = 8

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, and then convert that weight from ounces to pounds.

First, we determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make with 200 crayons:
200 crayons / 8 crayons per group = 25 groups

Since each group goes into a box, there will be 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the weight of the crayons:
200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces

Then, we calculate the weight of the boxes:
25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

Now, we add the weight of the crayons and the boxes to get the total weight in ounces:
200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, knowing that there are 16 ounces in a pound:
400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Grandma to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk and add that to the 40 minutes she spends on the beach.

Let's denote the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, her speed there is \( 2v \) miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, so we can calculate her speed on the beach:
\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk at twice the speed:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{2v} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on the beach to the time spent on the sidewalk to get the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 50 minutes.

The equation will be:
\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, the number of marbles he will have is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the 33-degree water, results in a mixture that is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water, the resulting temperature \( T_{\text{mix}} \) of the 5-ounce mixture can be calculated using the weighted average of the temperatures:

\[ T_{\text{mix}} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{4 + 1} \]

We know that \( T_{\text{mix}} \) must be at least 40 degrees for Donny to be able to drink it:

\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40 \]

Now we solve for \( T \):

\[ 4 \times 33 + T \geq 40 \times 5 \]
\[ 132 + T \geq 200 \]
\[ T \geq 200 - 132 \]
\[ T \geq 68 \]

So, the water in the second mug must be at least 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the increase in the number of cows and chickens and then add these to the initial numbers.

First, let's calculate the increase in the number of cows:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in three weeks, there are 3 * 7 = 21 days.
- The total number of cows added in three weeks is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.

Next, let's calculate the increase in the number of chickens:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- In three weeks, the total number of chickens added is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add the initial number of animals to the increases:
- Initial cows: 50
- Initial chickens: 20
- Total cows after three weeks: 50 + 420 = 470
- Total chickens after three weeks: 20 + 210 = 230

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals on the farm:
- Total animals: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate:
Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, which is:
23 - 5 = 18 scoops

Next, we need to determine how many potatoes are used to make a certain number of scoops of mashed potatoes. According to the problem, it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. This means:
6 - 3 = 3 potatoes
3 - 1 = 2 scoops

So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. We need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. We can set up a proportion to solve this:

3 potatoes / 2 scoops = x potatoes / 18 scoops

Cross-multiplying gives us:
2 * x = 3 * 18

Solving for x:
x = (3 * 18) / 2
x = 54 / 2
x = 27

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of eggs he eats and then convert that number into dozens.

First, we calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

Next, we calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the following 30 days:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the two amounts to get the total number of eggs for 60 days:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens Chester will need:
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of red jellybeans, which is twice the number of green jellybeans.
2. Add the number of green and red jellybeans to find the total number of non-blue jellybeans.
3. Subtract the total number of non-blue jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans.

Let's do the math:

1. Number of red jellybeans = 2 * number of green jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34
2. Total number of non-blue jellybeans = number of green jellybeans + number of red jellybeans = 17 + 34 = 51
3. Number of blue jellybeans = total number of jellybeans - total number of non-blue jellybeans = 60 - 51 = 9

So, the number of blue jellybeans is 9.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus before any women alight.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total ratio parts are 5 + 9 = 14 parts.

The total number of passengers is 84, so each part of the ratio represents 84 / 14 = 6 passengers.

The number of women on the bus is 9 parts, so there are 9 * 6 = 54 women.

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is 54 - 20 = 34 women.

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold and the number of sunflowers sold as part of bouquets, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold:
- Faraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers per day.
- Each sunflower costs $2.
- Therefore, the number of individual sunflowers sold per day is $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers.

For 3 days, the number of individual sunflowers sold is:
13 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 39 sunflowers.

Next, let's calculate the number of sunflowers sold as part of bouquets:
- Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets per day.
- Each bouquet costs $8.
- Therefore, the number of bouquets sold per day is $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets.

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold as part of bouquets per day is:
7 bouquets/day * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers.

For 3 days, the number of sunflowers sold as part of bouquets is:
84 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 252 sunflowers.

Finally, we add the number of individual sunflowers sold to the number of sunflowers sold as part of bouquets to get the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:
39 sunflowers + 252 sunflowers = 291 sunflowers.

"To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many rocks Adam can buy with $100.
2. Determine how many rocks he sells (60% of his inventory).
3. Calculate the revenue from selling the rocks.
4. Calculate the total cost of the rocks he bought.
5. Determine the loss by subtracting the revenue from the total cost.

Step 1: Number of rocks Adam can buy
Adam can buy $100 / $5 per rock = 20 rocks.

Step 2: Number of rocks he sells
60% of 20 rocks = 0.60 * 20 = 12 rocks.

Step 3: Revenue from selling the rocks
12 rocks * $7 per rock = $84.

Step 4: Total cost of the rocks
20 rocks * $5 per rock = $100.

Step 5: Loss
Total cost - Revenue = $100 - $84 = $16.

Adam loses $16.

"To determine how many days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days required for each size of picture scenes and then sum them up.

For large-sized picture scenes:
45 large scenes / 5 large scenes per day = 9 days

For medium-sized picture scenes:
36 medium scenes / 6 medium scenes per day = 6 days

For small-sized picture scenes:
49 small scenes / 7 small scenes per day = 7 days

Now, we add the days required for each size:
9 days (large) + 6 days (medium) + 7 days (small) = 22 days

Therefore, it will take Lauren 22 days to create all of the picture scenes.

"To find the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probability of winning with the first ticket by the probability of winning with the second ticket.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket, so its probability of winning is 3 times 0.20, which is 0.60.

Now, we multiply the two probabilities together to find the probability that both tickets win:

0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.12 * 100 = 12%

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song and then add it to the length of the first song.

The first song is 5 minutes long.

The second song is 60% longer than the first song, so we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes to get the length of the second song.

60% of 5 minutes is 0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes.

So, the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.

Now, we add the lengths of both songs to get the total time of the cassette:

5 minutes (first song) + 8 minutes (second song) = 13 minutes.

"To calculate the profit Linus earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the selling price of one mobile device.
2. Calculate the total cost of the devices bought on Monday and Tuesday.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the devices.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

Step 1: The selling price of one mobile device is twice the amount of the original price, so:
Selling price = 2 * $20 = $40

Step 2: The total cost of the devices bought on Monday and Tuesday is:
Total cost = (2 devices * $20) + (4 devices * $20) = $40 + $80 = $120

Step 3: The total revenue from selling all the devices is:
Total revenue = (2 devices * $40) + (4 devices * $40) = $80 + $160 = $240

Step 4: The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 1 person.
2. Since 1 bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy needs, 5 bottles (100% / 20%) are needed to cover 100% of a person's daily energy needs.
3. Multiply the number of bottles needed per person by the total number of people (2300) to find the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people.
4. Subtract the number of bottles Hortex can currently produce (4200) from the total number of bottles needed to find out how many more bottles are required.

Let's do the math:

"To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
2. Calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
3. Calculate the total number of collections John makes in a week.
4. Calculate the total amount of money John makes in a week.

Step 1: The third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined.
- The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have 200 * 2 = 400 apartments.
- The third complex is 60% bigger, so it has 400 * 0.60 = 240 more apartments.
- Therefore, the third complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Step 2: The total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
- The total is 200 (first complex) + 200 (second complex) + 640 (third complex) = 1040 apartments.

Step 3: The total number of collections John makes in a week.
- John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections is 1040 * 3 = 3120 collections.

Step 4: The total amount of money John makes in a week.
- John gets paid $0.40 per collection, so the total amount of money he makes is 3120 * 0.40 = $1248.

Therefore, John makes $1248 in a week.

3. A 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. A 10-year-old avocado tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.
5. An 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, which is 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
6. During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit, so it produces 0 fruits.

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \), the length of the red rope as \( R \), and the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \).

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope:
   \( R = 4B \)

2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
   \( B = Y - 7 \)

3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
   \( R + B + Y = 37 \)

We can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to find the lengths of the ropes.

First, we express \( Y \) in terms of \( B \):
   \( Y = B + 7 \)

Now we substitute \( R \) and \( Y \) in the third equation:
   \( 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \)

Combine like terms:
   \( 6B + 7 = 37 \)

Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \( 6B = 30 \)

Divide by 6:
   \( B = 5 \)

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( R \):
   \( R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \)

So the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

Now, let's say each of them gave their little sister $x.

3. After giving $x to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money. This means that Rissa's remaining money is 4/5 * $15.

We can set up the equation for Rissa's remaining money after giving $x to her sister:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Solving for x:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, each of them gave $3 to their little sister.

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box, we need to first determine how many pods are in the special size box and then calculate the cost per pod.

A regular box has 100 pods and costs $12. The special size box has 20% more pods, so we calculate the number of additional pods:

20% of 100 pods = 0.20 * 100 = 20 pods

Therefore, the special size box has:

100 pods + 20 pods = 120 pods

The special size box also costs $12, so the cost per pod is:

$12 / 120 pods = $0.10 per pod

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, the number of cycles you can run for $1 is:

$1 / $0.10 per pod = 10 cycles

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills. To find out how many $20 bills he has, we divide $1000 by $20:
   $1000 / $20 = 50 bills

2. He loses 10 of these $20 bills, so he has:
   50 bills - 10 bills = 40 bills

3. He uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill, so he uses:

4. After paying the bill, he has:
   40 bills - 20 bills = 20 bills

5. Thomas then triples his money, so he has:
   20 bills * 3 = 60 bills

6. Each of these 60 bills is a $20 bill, so the total amount of money he has is:
   60 bills * $20 = $1200

7. He then converts all his money into $5 bills. To find out how many $5 bills he has, we divide $1200 by $5:

Let's denote the length of the chalk at the start of each day as \( L \). The length of the chalk at the end of the day will be \( L - 0.20L = 0.80L \).

We will calculate the length of the chalk at the end of each day until it is less than 2 inches:

- Start of Tuesday: 2.75 inches
- End of Tuesday: 2.75 inches * 0.80 = 2.20 inches
- End of Wednesday: 2.20 inches * 0.80 = 1.76 inches

At the end of Wednesday, the chalk is 1.76 inches, which is less than 2 inches, so the teacher will have to recycle the chalk at the end of Wednesday.

Therefore, the teacher has 2 more days (Tuesday and Wednesday) before he has to recycle the piece of chalk.

"To find out how many students are not on varsity, we first need to calculate how many boys and girls are on varsity.

One-third of the girls are on varsity:
12 girls * 1/3 = 4 girls on varsity

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity:
12 boys * 1/4 = 3 boys on varsity

Now, we add the number of boys and girls on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity:
4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students on varsity

The total number of students in the class is:
12 boys + 12 girls = 24 students

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:
24 students - 7 students on varsity = 17 students not on varsity

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to calculate the total number of teeth the dentist works on and then divide that by the total number of teeth James has, and finally multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. So, the number of teeth capped is 4 (drilled) + 7 = 11 teeth.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped, which is 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.

Now, to find the percentage of teeth fixed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of teeth fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of teeth fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of teeth fixed} = 0.5 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of teeth fixed} = 50\% \]

"To calculate the refund Mr. Marcellus received, we need to determine the amount of milk that was returned and then calculate the cost of that amount.

1. First, we find out how much milk was expired:
   2/5 of 4000 gallons = (2/5) * 4000 = 1600 gallons

2. Next, we calculate the cost of the expired milk:
   1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $5600

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600.

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:

\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:

\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

We can solve this system by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From the first equation, we can express \( W \) in terms of \( C \):

\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Now we substitute \( W \) in the second equation:

\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]

Expand and simplify:

\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract 3C from both sides:

\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:

\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide by 2:

\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to determine the total number of books he can buy with $27000. 

The cost of 100 books is $500, so the cost of 1 book is $500 / 100 = $5.

With $27000, the total number of books Bob can buy is $27000 / $5 = 5400 books.

Since the books are to be distributed between 3 schools, the number of books per school is 5400 / 3 = 1800 books.

"Let's break down the sequence of events to determine how many apples Newton brought home:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up both apples.
3. He put one apple in his pocket and threw the other one into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall.
4. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples on the ground.
5. He picked up the 5 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree.
6. This caused another 6 apples to fall out of the tree.
7. Now, he has 5 apples in his pocket, 1 apple on the ground, and 6 more apples have fallen.
8. He picked up all the remaining 7 apples (1 + 6) and put them in his pocket.

So, the total number of apples Newton brought home is the sum of the apples in his pocket:

- 1 apple from the first two that fell
- 4 apples from the 5 that fell after he threw the first apple
- 7 apples from the last 7 that fell after he threw the second apple

1 + 4 + 7 = 12

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices her friends will eat and then convert that into the number of whole pizzas.

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices her friends will eat:
6 friends * 6 slices each = 36 slices of cheese pizza

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we can find out how many cheese pizzas are needed by dividing the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 cheese pizzas

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices her friends will eat:
6 friends * 4 slices each = 24 slices of pepperoni pizza

Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we can find out how many pepperoni pizzas are needed by dividing the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pepperoni pizzas

Now, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas to find the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy:
3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 6 pizza pies in total.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the net number of snowballs Jay can make in a given time, taking into account the melting rate.

Jay makes 20 snowballs in an hour. Since 15 minutes is a quarter of an hour, in 15 minutes he makes 20 / 4 = 5 snowballs.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so the net number of snowballs he gains in 15 minutes is 5 - 2 = 3 snowballs.

To find out how long it will take to make 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net number of snowballs made every 15 minutes:

60 snowballs / 3 snowballs per 15 minutes = 20 sets of 15 minutes.

Since each set of 15 minutes is a quarter of an hour, we multiply the number of sets by 15 to get the total time in minutes:

20 sets * 15 minutes/set = 300 minutes.

To convert this into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours.

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of John and Jim at the time Digimon came out and then use that information to find Jim's current age.

1. First, we know that Digimon had its 20th anniversary, which means it came out 20 years ago.
2. John is 28 years old now, so 20 years ago, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.
3. At that time, John was twice as old as Jim. If John was 8 years old, then Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.
4. Now, to find out how old Jim is now, we add 20 years to his age at the time Digimon came out: 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

So, Jim is 24 years old now.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
2. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.

Now, let's calculate the total number of bandages used and received over the three days:

- Total bandages used: 38 (first day) + 28 (second day) + 25 (third day) = 91 bandages.
- Total bandages received: 50 (first day) + 100 (third day) = 150 bandages.

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. To find out how many bandages they started with, we need to add the bandages used to the bandages they ended with and then subtract the bandages received:

Starting bandages = Bandages used + Bandages left at the end - Bandages received
Starting bandages = 91 + 78 - 150

Now, let's do the math:

Starting bandages = 169 - 150
Starting bandages = 19

So, the nurses started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"May's haircut cost is calculated based on the length of hair cut off. She started with 10 inches and ended with 8 inches, so 2 inches were cut off. The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch, so for 2 inches, it would be 2 * $30 = $60. The cost for the hair color is a flat rate of $40. Therefore, the total cost for the cut and color is $60 (for the cut) + $40 (for the color) = $100.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider both her regular earnings and the additional attendance bonus.

First, we calculate her regular earnings:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

Regular earnings per day = 7.5 hours * $1.5/hour
Regular earnings per week = Regular earnings per day * 6 days/week
Regular earnings for April = Regular earnings per week * 4 weeks

Now, we add the attendance bonus:
- Jen receives an additional $10 for each week of complete attendance.
- Since there are 4 weeks in April and she had no absences, she will receive the bonus for all 4 weeks.

Total attendance bonus for April = $10/week * 4 weeks

Total earnings for April = Regular earnings for April + Total attendance bonus for April

Let's do the math:

Regular earnings per day = 7.5 * 1.5 = $11.25
Regular earnings per week = 11.25 * 6 = $67.50
Regular earnings for April = 67.50 * 4 = $270.00

Total attendance bonus for April = 10 * 4 = $40.00

Total earnings for April = 270.00 + 40.00 = $310.00

"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the amount he earns for each task by the number of times he completed that task and then sum up all the earnings.

For doing his laundry once, he earns: $3.00
For cleaning his room once, he earns: $1.50
For taking the trash out twice, he earns: 2 * $0.75 = $1.50
For emptying the dishwasher 6 times, he earns: 6 * $0.50 = $3.00

Now, we add up all the earnings:

$3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning room) + $1.50 (trash) + $3.00 (dishwasher) = $9.00

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in the two-week period.

"To find out how many pens Alain has, we need to calculate the total number of red and black pens.

First, we calculate the number of red pens:
- Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
- Each pack has 5 pens.
- Therefore, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 pens.

Next, we calculate the number of black pens:
- Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens.
- Since she bought 5 packs of red pens, she bought 2 * 5 = 10 packs of black pens.
- Each pack has 5 pens.
- Therefore, the total number of black pens is 10 packs * 5 pens/pack = 50 pens.

Finally, we add the number of red and black pens to find the total number of pens:
- Total pens = number of red pens + number of black pens
- Total pens = 25 pens + 50 pens = 75 pens.

So, Alain has 75 pens in total.

"To find out how much John spends on everything, we need to calculate the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the cost per bottle of scotch:
Cost per bottle of scotch = Total cost of scotch / Number of bottles of scotch
Cost per bottle of scotch = $600 / 10
Cost per bottle of scotch = $60

Next, we determine the number of bottles of cognac John buys:
Number of bottles of cognac = 2 * Number of bottles of scotch
Number of bottles of cognac = 2 * 10
Number of bottles of cognac = 20

Now, we calculate the cost per bottle of cognac, which is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch:
Cost per bottle of cognac = Cost per bottle of scotch + (50% of Cost per bottle of scotch)
Cost per bottle of cognac = $60 + (0.5 * $60)
Cost per bottle of cognac = $60 + $30
Cost per bottle of cognac = $90

Then, we calculate the total cost of the cognac:
Total cost of cognac = Number of bottles of cognac * Cost per bottle of cognac
Total cost of cognac = 20 * $90
Total cost of cognac = $1800

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find out how much John spends on everything:
Total spent = Total cost of scotch + Total cost of cognac
Total spent = $600 + $1800
Total spent = $2400

"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which means he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total number of White Oak trees planted on the second day is 10.

For the Lodgepole Pine trees, he planted 1/4 more than the first day. So, he planted an additional 1/4 * 40 = 10 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day, which means he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

Now, let's add up all the trees he planted over the two days:

First day White Oak trees: 20
Second day White Oak trees: 10
Total White Oak trees: 20 + 10 = 30

First day Lodgepole Pine trees: 40
Second day Lodgepole Pine trees: 50
Total Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 + 50 = 90

Total trees planted: 30 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 120

2. She also had three makeup sets with six eyeshadow colors each, so that's 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.
3. Her sister steals one of the palettes, so Amy loses 4 colors, leaving her with 8 - 4 = 4 colors from the remaining palette.
4. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, so she uses 6 / 2 = 3 colors from that set.
5. After using up 3 colors from one makeup set, she has 6 - 3 = 3 colors left from that set.
6. The other two makeup sets are untouched, so she still has 2 * 6 = 12 colors from those sets.

Now, let's add up all the colors Amy has left:

4 (from the remaining palette) + 3 (from the used makeup set) + 12 (from the two untouched makeup sets) = 19 colors.

Let's calculate the selling price:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = 11 \times 9 = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]

"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. On the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day. Over 3 days, it would remove:
   1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters

2. On the medium setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much as the low setting, which is 2 liters per day. Over 3 days, it would remove:

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we need to calculate the total capacity of the classes in each school and then add them together.

First, let's find the capacity of each of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

120 students / 8 = 15 students

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

15 students/class * 2 classes = 30 students

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's school, which is just the capacity of his one class:

120 students

Finally, we add the capacities of both schools together to get the combined capacity:

120 students (Ali's school) + 30 students (John's school) = 150 students

"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the total amount he owes including the interest, and then subtract the amount he has already paid over the 11 months.

First, let's calculate the interest on the $300 that Stephen borrowed. The interest is 2% of $300.

Interest = 2% of $300
Interest = 0.02 * $300
Interest = $6

So, the total amount Stephen owes is the original $300 plus the $6 interest, which is $306.

Next, we need to calculate how much Stephen has paid over the 11 months. He pays $25 per month.

Total paid over 11 months = 11 * $25
Total paid over 11 months = $275

Now, we subtract the amount Stephen has already paid from the total amount he owes to find out how much he will pay in the twelfth month.

Amount to pay in the twelfth month = Total amount owed - Total paid over 11 months
Amount to pay in the twelfth month = $306 - $275
Amount to pay in the twelfth month = $31

So, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month.

"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of diaper changes per day for both children.
2. Determine how many of those diaper changes Jordan's wife handles.
3. Subtract the number of diaper changes Jordan's wife handles from the total to find out how many Jordan changes.

Step 1: Total number of diaper changes per day
Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children.
Total diaper changes = 5 changes/child/day * 2 children = 10 changes/day

Step 2: Number of diaper changes Jordan's wife handles
Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers.
Wife's diaper changes = 10 changes/day * 1/2 = 5 changes/day

Step 3: Number of diaper changes Jordan handles
Jordan changes the remaining half of the diapers.
Jordan's diaper changes = Total diaper changes - Wife's diaper changes
Jordan's diaper changes = 10 changes/day - 5 changes/day = 5 changes/day

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to calculate the total number of jelly beans he estimated to be in the jar and then find out how many of those he estimated to be red. We can then compare his estimate of the number of red jelly beans to the true number, which is 900.

First, we calculate the volume of the jar:
Volume of the jar = base area * height
Volume of the jar = 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches
Volume of the jar = 36 * 15
Volume of the jar = 540 cubic inches

Next, we calculate the effective volume that can be occupied by the jelly beans, taking into account the 80% packing efficiency:
Effective volume = volume of the jar * packing efficiency
Effective volume = 540 cubic inches * 0.80
Effective volume = 432 cubic inches

Now, we calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar based on the effective volume and the volume of a single jelly bean:
Total number of jelly beans = effective volume / volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red:
Estimated number of red jelly beans = total number of jelly beans * 30%
Estimated number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.30
Estimated number of red jelly beans = 864

The true number of red jelly beans is 900, so we can now calculate how far off Tim's guess was:
Difference = true number of red jelly beans - estimated number of red jelly beans
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The bus departed Chengli city with 20 people.
2. On the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, so the total number of people on the bus is now 20 + 40 = 60 people.
3. On the second stop, 3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered the bus. That's 3/4 * 40 = 30 people.
4. After the second stop, the total number of people on the bus is 60 + 30 = 90 people.
5. At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled, so the total number of people on the bus is now 90 * 2 = 180 people.
6. The bus has a capacity of 200 people, so the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 200 - 180 = 20 people.

"To calculate the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost of visits for the first 5 years and the cost of visits for the next 3 years after the price increase.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first 5 years:
- Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
- The cost of one visit is $2.
- The total cost for one year is 3 visits * $2/visit = $6.
- The total cost for 5 years is 5 years * $6/year = $30.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the next 3 years after the price increase:
- The cost of one visit has increased by 150%.
- 150% of $2 is 1.5 * $2 = $3.
- The new cost of one visit is $2 + $3 = $5.
- The total cost for one year after the increase is 3 visits * $5/visit = $15.
- The total cost for 3 years after the increase is 3 years * $15/year = $45.

Finally, we add the costs of both periods to get the total amount spent:
- Total amount spent = cost for first 5 years + cost for next 3 years
- Total amount spent = $30 + $45 = $75.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed from the 10 students in each grade, and then calculate the total time required for all groups to complete the escape room challenge.

Since there are 10 students in each grade and only 8 can try the escape room at a time, we can form one group of 8 and one group of 2 (which will need to be paired with other students to form a full group of 8). However, since the question specifies that only the top 10 students in each grade get to try the escape room, and only 8 can go at a time, we will have to form two groups of 8 by combining the top 10 from each grade.

There are 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th), so we have:

- 4 grades * 10 students = 40 students in total.
- 40 students / 8 students per group = 5 groups.

Each group takes 45 minutes to complete the escape room, so the total time required for all groups is:

- 5 groups * 45 minutes per group = 225 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames.

The cost of the wooden tables is:
4 tables * $20/table = $80

The cost of the roof frames is:
2 frames * $10/frame = $20

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the tables and the frames:
$80 + $20 = $100

So, Ali has to pay John $100.

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 5x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

The length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The longer piece is 4 times this length:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

So, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To find out how much of his secret seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of ground beef are needed for 80 meatballs.
2. Calculate the amount of seasoning needed based on the number of pounds of ground beef.

Step 1: Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. To find out how many pounds he needs for 80 meatballs, we divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of ground beef

Step 2: Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef. To find out how much seasoning he needs for 5 pounds, we multiply the number of pounds by the amount of seasoning per pound:

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.

16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

For the remaining 20 minutes (36 minutes total - 16 minutes), the cost is $0.20 per minute:
20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

Now, we add the cost of both segments to get the total cost of the call:
$4.00 (first 16 minutes) + $4.00 (remaining 20 minutes) = $8.00

The total cost of a 36-minute call is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let the number of cupcakes Carly makes be \( c \).
2. According to the problem, the number of brownies Carly makes is 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes, which can be expressed as \( 3c - 2 \).
3. Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats, so the total number of treats needed is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).
4. The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and brownies, which is \( c + (3c - 2) \).
5. We can set up the equation: \( c + 3c - 2 = 10 \).
6. Simplify the equation: \( 4c - 2 = 10 \).
7. Add 2 to both sides of the equation: \( 4c = 12 \).
8. Divide both sides by 4: \( c = 3 \).

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"To calculate the total cost for Karen, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure without the discount.
2. Apply the 20% discount to the combined cost of the manicure and pedicure.
3. Calculate the cost of the nail art.
4. Add the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art.

Let's do the math:

1. The cost of a basic manicure is $35 and a pedicure is $40.
2. The combined cost before the discount is $35 + $40 = $75.
3. The 20% discount on the combined cost is 20/100 * $75 = $15.
4. The discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.
5. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, which are 10 in total (5 on each hand). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost for nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.
6. The total cost for Karen is the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of the nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

Therefore, Karen would pay $90 in all.

"To find out how many paintings Kim has, we can set up the relationships described in the problem with the following equations:

Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as K.

Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so Shelley has K + 8 paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can write:

Samantha's paintings = Shelley's paintings - 12
27 = (K + 8) - 12

Now we can solve for K:

27 = K + 8 - 12
27 = K - 4
K = 27 + 4
K = 31

So, Kim has 31 paintings.

"To find the final price of the toy after the changes in December and January, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after the 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after the 50% decrease.

Step 1: December price increase
The price in November was $40. An 80% increase means the price in December is:
\[ \text{December Price} = \text{November Price} + (\text{November Price} \times 80\%) \]
\[ \text{December Price} = 40 + (40 \times 0.80) \]
\[ \text{December Price} = 40 + 32 \]
\[ \text{December Price} = 72 \]

Step 2: January price decrease
The price in January is 50% less than the December price:
\[ \text{January Price} = \text{December Price} - (\text{December Price} \times 50\%) \]
\[ \text{January Price} = 72 - (72 \times 0.50) \]
\[ \text{January Price} = 72 - 36 \]
\[ \text{January Price} = 36 \]

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36.

"To find the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then divide it by the total distance between Alaska and Texas, and finally multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

First, we calculate the total distance Michael has traveled in 3 days. Since he is traveling at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days. Assuming he travels 24 hours a day (which is unlikely, but we'll use this for the sake of the calculation), the total hours traveled in 3 days would be:

3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance he has covered:

Distance covered = Speed * Time
Distance covered = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance covered = 3600 km

Now, we calculate the percentage of the total distance (6000 km) that he has covered:

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

2. Calculate the total time the custodian spends cleaning per day.
3. Calculate the total time the custodian works in a day in minutes.
4. Calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning.

Step 1: Total time to clean all classrooms
- There are 80 classrooms, and it takes 15 minutes to clean each one.
- Total cleaning time = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Step 2: Total time spent cleaning per day
- The custodian has 5 days to clean all the classrooms.

"To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the total number of books that one bookcase can hold.

Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books, so together they can hold:
2 shelves * 10 books/shelf = 20 books

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold:
2 * 10 books = 20 books

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold:
20 books - 5 books = 15 books

Now, we add up the total number of books that one bookcase can hold:
20 books (middle shelves) + 20 books (bottom shelf) + 15 books (top shelf) = 55 books

Elly has 110 books in total. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold:
110 books / 55 books/bookcase = 2 bookcases

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To calculate Rose's profit, we need to determine her total cost and her total revenue, and then subtract the cost from the revenue.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs:
- Rose bought five dozens of eggs.
- Each dozen costs $2.40.
- Total cost = 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs:
- There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so five dozens contain 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.
- Rose sells the eggs at a rate of $1 for 3 eggs.
- To find out how many sets of 3 eggs there are in 60 eggs, we divide 60 by 3, which gives us 20 sets.
- Total revenue = 20 sets * $1/set = $20.00

Now, we can calculate the profit:

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade, we need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly across both tests, and then subtract the number of questions she already got right on the first test.

First, let's find out the total number of questions across both tests:
70 questions (first test) + 40 questions (second test) = 110 questions (total)

Next, we calculate 70% of the total questions to find out how many she needs to answer correctly to pass:
70% of 110 questions = 0.70 * 110 = 77 questions

Now, we know that Audrey got 60% of the 70 questions correct on the first test:
60% of 70 questions = 0.60 * 70 = 42 questions

To find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly:
77 questions (needed to pass) - 42 questions (correct on the first test) = 35 questions

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be written as:

\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, which is the sum of the strawberry and blueberry cubes:

\[ S + B = 116 \]

Now we can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by plugging \( S \) back into the equation for \( B \):

\[ B = 5S - 4 \]
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break down the problem into steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many customers need to come into the dealership to sell 15 cars. Since for every 2 customers, 1 buys a car, we can set up the following ratio:
   2 customers : 1 car = x customers : 15 cars

   Solving for x gives us:
   x = 15 cars * 2 customers / 1 car
   x = 30 customers

   So, Jason needs 30 customers to come into the dealership to sell 15 cars.

2. Next, we need to find out how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to get 30 customers to come into the dealership. Since for every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes in, we can set up the following ratio:
   25 calls : 1 customer = y calls : 30 customers

   Solving for y gives us:
   y = 30 customers * 25 calls / 1 customer
   y = 750 calls

   Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights and candles that Brianna's family has.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights:
- There is 1 flashlight for each of the 4 people living in the house.
- There are 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms.

So the total number of flashlights is:
4 (for the people) + (2 * 8) (for the rooms) = 4 + 16 = 20 flashlights.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles:
- There are 4 small candles for half the rooms. Since there are 8 rooms, half of them would be 4 rooms.
- There are 5 medium candles for the other half of the rooms, which is also 4 rooms.

So the total number of candles is:
(4 small candles * 4 rooms) + (5 medium candles * 4 rooms) = 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together to get the final answer:
20 flashlights + 36 candles = 56 items.

"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to calculate the total number of chips and then divide that number by the number of family members.

Mitchell buys two bags of chips, each with 55 chips. So the total number of chips is:
2 bags * 55 chips/bag = 110 chips

There are five members in his family, so we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members:
110 chips / 5 people = 22 chips/person

Each person gets 22 chips.

"To solve this, let's break down the time taken for each side of the Rubik's cube:

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first, so they each take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.
- The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first, so they each take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.
- The sixth side is completed when the fifth side is done, so it doesn't add any extra time.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes
- Sixth side: 0 minutes (included in the fifth side)

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 0 = 30 minutes

"To find out how many calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he spends at work in a week and then divide that by the number of minutes it takes him to deal with one call.

First, we calculate the total number of hours Tim works in a week:
6 hours/day * 5 days/week = 30 hours/week

Next, we convert the total hours to minutes:
30 hours/week * 60 minutes/hour = 1800 minutes/week

Now, we divide the total minutes by the time it takes to deal with one call:
1800 minutes/week / 15 minutes/call = 120 calls/week

So, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week.

"To find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish, we can calculate the total drying time for both varnishes and then find the difference.

For the old varnish:
- It takes 7 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, it would take 7 minutes * 6 = 42 minutes.

For the new varnish:
- It takes 12 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, it would take 12 minutes * 6 = 72 minutes.

The difference in drying time between the new and old varnish for 6 paintings is:
- 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes.

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish.

"To calculate the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants every day, we can break it down as follows:

- 4 plants need half a cup of water each, so 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups of water.
- 8 plants need 1 cup of water each, so 8 * 1 = 8 cups of water.
- The rest of the plants (20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants) need a quarter of a cup of water each, so 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups of water.

Now, we add up all the water needed:

2 (from the half-cup plants) + 8 (from the one-cup plants) + 2 (from the quarter-cup plants) = 12 cups of water.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Phineas Frog to travel half the distance on land and the other half in water.

The total distance Phineas needs to travel is 200 yards. Half of this distance is 100 yards on land and the other 100 yards in water.

On land, Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute. To find out how long it takes him to hop 100 yards, we divide the distance by his speed:
100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

In water, Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute. To find out how long it takes him to swim 100 yards, we divide the distance by his speed:
100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

To find the total time it takes for Phineas to return home, we add the time spent on land to the time spent in water:
5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home.

"To find out how long it would take John to speak 10 pages after his training, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate John's new speaking speed after training.
2. Determine the total number of words in 10 pages.
3. Calculate the time it would take to speak those words at the new speed.

Step 1: John's new speaking speed
John's new speed is 2.5 times his starting speed of 150 WPM (words per minute).
New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Step 2: Total number of words in 10 pages
Each page has 450 words, so 10 pages would have:
Total words = 450 words/page * 10 pages = 4500 words

Step 3: Time to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM
Time (in minutes) = Total words / Speed in WPM
Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed.

"To calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to add the number of people he saw each day.

On the first day, there were 50 people.
On the second day, there were 50 + 20 = 70 people.
On the third day, there were 2 * 70 = 140 people.

For the remaining four days of the week, Conor saw an average of 60 people each day, so the total for these days is 4 * 60 = 240 people.

Now, we add the totals for all seven days together:
50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (remaining four days) = 500 people.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 500.

"To find out how many pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat, we need to calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval and then add them all up.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. In the following 30 seconds, four times the initial amount pop, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so it's 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.
5. After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, we add up all the kernels that popped:

20 (first 30 seconds) + 60 (second 30 seconds) + 80 (third 30 seconds) + 40 (fourth 30 seconds) + 10 (after heat) = 210

So, Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat.

"To determine the total number of lemons Tim will need, we need to calculate the amount of lemon juice required for the pool party and for the extra gallon that Allen requested.

For the pool party:
- 1 gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of lemon juice.
- Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade.
- Therefore, 4 gallons of lemonade will require 4 cups of lemon juice.

For Allen's extra gallon:
- Allen wants a gallon that is twice as tart, which means it will require 2 cups of lemon juice.

In total:
- 4 gallons for the party + 1 gallon for Allen = 5 gallons of lemonade.
- 4 cups for the party + 2 cups for Allen = 6 cups of lemon juice.

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice:
- 6 cups of lemon juice will require 6 lemons * 6 cups = 36 lemons.

Therefore, Tim will need 36 lemons in total.

"To find the number of red blocks, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of red blocks as \( R \).

The number of blue blocks is given as 4.
The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, so that's \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \).

The total number of blocks is the sum of the blue, yellow, and red blocks, which is 32.

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]

Now, we solve for \( R \):
\[ 12 + R = 32 \]
\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

Therefore, there are 20 red blocks.

"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in each direction and then find the difference.

First, we calculate the distance he traveled west:
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Then, we calculate the distance he traveled east:
Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Since Elvis traveled east after traveling west, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east to find out how far he is from his house:
Distance from house = Distance east - Distance west
Distance from house = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Elvis is 54 miles from his house now.

"To find the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to apply the depreciation rate for each year to the value of the boat at the beginning of that year.

1. After the first year, the boat depreciates by 30%. The value of the boat at the end of the first year is:
   Value after 1st year = Original value - (Depreciation rate * Original value)
   Value after 1st year = $9000 - (0.30 * $9000)
   Value after 1st year = $9000 - $2700
   Value after 1st year = $6300

2. After the second year, the boat depreciates by another 30%. The value of the boat at the end of the second year is:
   Value after 2nd year = Value after 1st year - (Depreciation rate * Value after 1st year)
   Value after 2nd year = $6300 - (0.30 * $6300)
   Value after 2nd year = $6300 - $1890
   Value after 2nd year = $4410

3. After the third year, the boat depreciates by 20%. The value of the boat at the end of the third year is:
   Value after 3rd year = Value after 2nd year - (Depreciation rate * Value after 2nd year)
   Value after 3rd year = $4410 - (0.20 * $4410)
   Value after 3rd year = $4410 - $882
   Value after 3rd year = $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after the three years.

"To calculate the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to add the cost of the hotel stays and the cost of the bus rides.

The cost of one night at the hotel is $80. Since Helen stayed for 3 nights, the total cost for the hotel is:
3 nights * $80/night = $240

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. So, the cost of one bus trip is:
10% of $80 = 0.10 * $80 = $8

Helen rode the bus 7 times, so the total cost for the bus rides is:
7 rides * $8/ride = $56

Now, we add the total cost of the hotel and the total cost of the bus rides to find the total cost of the trip:
Total cost = Cost of hotel + Cost of bus rides
Total cost = $240 + $56
Total cost = $296

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much money James has, we need to calculate the total value of the coins he found. Here's the breakdown:

- A quarter is worth 25 cents.
- A nickel is worth 5 cents, and since he found two, that's 2 * 5 = 10 cents.
- A dime is worth 10 cents, and since he found seven, that's 7 * 10 = 70 cents.

Now, we add up all the values:

25 (quarter) + 10 (two nickels) + 70 (seven dimes) = 105 cents

So, James has 105 cents.

"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to add up the ages of the 2 brothers and the 3 sisters.

The age of the younger brother is 12 years old.
The age of the older brother is twice that of the younger brother, so he is 12 * 2 = 24 years old.
Each sister is 16 years old, and there are 3 sisters, so their total age is 16 * 3 = 48 years.

Now, we add up the ages of all the siblings:
12 (younger brother) + 24 (older brother) + 48 (three sisters) = 84

"To calculate the total time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to break it down into two parts: meditation and yoga.

For meditation:
- She meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, which totals 30 minutes per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so she meditates for 30 minutes * 7 days = 210 minutes per week.
- Over 4 weeks, she will meditate for 210 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 840 minutes.

For yoga:
- She practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week.
- Over 4 weeks, she will practice yoga for 60 minutes * 5 days/week * 4 weeks = 1200 minutes.

Adding the time spent on meditation and yoga together:
- 840 minutes (meditation) + 1200 minutes (yoga) = 2040 minutes.

Now, let's convert the total minutes into hours for a more understandable format:
- 2040 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 34 hours.

So, in 4 weeks, Charisma has spent 34 hours on meditation and yoga practice.

"To find the total square footage of the quilt, we need to multiply the number of each type of shirt by its respective square footage and then sum the results.

For small shirts:
11 small shirts * 3 square feet per small shirt = 33 square feet

For medium shirts:
8 medium shirts * 4 square feet per medium shirt = 32 square feet

For large shirts:
6 large shirts * 6 square feet per large shirt = 36 square feet

Now, we add the square footage of all the shirts together to get the total square footage of the quilt:
33 square feet + 32 square feet + 36 square feet = 101 square feet

"To find out how tall Jackie was before the summer, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Anne's height.
2. Calculate Jackie's current height.
3. Subtract the growth over the summer to find Jackie's height before the summer.

Step 1: Anne's height
Anne is twice the size of Albert, and Albert is 36"" tall.
So, Anne's height = 2 * 36"" = 72"".

Step 2: Jackie's current height
Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne.
So, Jackie's current height = Anne's height - 2"" = 72"" - 2"" = 70"".

Step 3: Jackie's height before the summer
Jackie grew 3"" over the summer.
So, Jackie's height before the summer = Jackie's current height - 3"" = 70"" - 3"" = 67"".

Jackie was 67"" tall before the summer.

"To calculate the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to consider the discounts on the T-shirts and the shoes.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts with the buy one get one 50% off deal:
- The first T-shirt is at the original price: $8.
- The second T-shirt is at 50% off: $8 * 50% = $4.

So, the total cost for the T-shirts is: $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes with the 40% discount:
- The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40: $40 * 40% = $16.
- The discounted price of the shoes is: $40 - $16 = $24.

"To calculate the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of the honey and jam mix, we need to determine the cost of making one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we can calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars and subtract the total cost to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the cost of making one jar:

- Cost of passion fruit per jar: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
- Cost of jackfruit per jar: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
- Cost of honey per jar: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20

Total cost to make one jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 10 jars:

Total cost for 10 jars = 10 * $44 = $440

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars:

Total revenue from 10 jars = 10 * $50 = $500

Finally, we calculate the profit:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $500 - $440 = $60

"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then sum them up.

- Quarters are worth $0.25 each, so 32 quarters are worth 32 * $0.25.
- Dimes are worth $0.10 each, so 95 dimes are worth 95 * $0.10.
- Nickels are worth $0.05 each, so 120 nickels are worth 120 * $0.05.
- Pennies are worth $0.01 each, so 750 pennies are worth 750 * $0.01.

Now, let's calculate the total value:

- 32 quarters * $0.25 = $8.00
- 95 dimes * $0.10 = $9.50
- 120 nickels * $0.05 = $6.00
- 750 pennies * $0.01 = $7.50

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation and then determine how long it takes for Nate to fill them in, considering the dog continues to dig new holes.

1. First, we calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog during the 14 days:
   \( 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \)

2. Next, we need to determine the net number of holes filled by Nate each day. Since Nate fills in 9 holes a day and the dog digs 6 new holes each night, the net number of holes filled each day is:
   \( 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \)

3. Now, we can calculate how many days it will take for Nate to fill in all 84 holes:
   \( 84 \text{ holes} \div 3 \text{ holes/day} = 28 \text{ days} \)

4. Finally, we convert the number of days into weeks:

Butler High School enrollment = 3/4 * Norman High School enrollment
Butler High School enrollment = 3/4 * 4000
Butler High School enrollment = 3000

Now, we can find the difference in enrollment between the two schools:

"To find out how many beakers Igor lost, we need to determine how many items he actually placed on the lab bench and compare that to the number of items he was supposed to place.

Dr. Grumpus requested:
- 16 test tubes
- 7 beakers

Igor gathered:
- Half as many test tubes as requested: 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes
- Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes
- The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers

The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29. We can set up the equation to find out how many beakers he lost:

8 (test tubes) + x (beakers) + 16 (Petri dishes) = 29

Now we solve for x:

8 + x + 16 = 29
24 + x = 29
x = 29 - 24
x = 5

Igor placed 5 beakers on the lab bench, which means he lost:

7 (requested beakers) - 5 (beakers placed) = 2 beakers

So, Igor lost 2 beakers.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it took for Vanessa to run her part of the race. We know that Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, and Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did.

First, let's find out how far Aaron ran. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles and that is twice the distance Aaron ran, Aaron must have run 2 miles.

Next, we need to find out how long it took Aaron to run 1 mile. Since Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes, it took him 16 / 2 = 8 minutes to run 1 mile.

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, it means that Vanessa takes twice as long to run a mile. Therefore, it takes Vanessa 8 * 2 = 16 minutes to run 1 mile.

Now, we can calculate the time it took Vanessa to run her 4 miles. Since it takes her 16 minutes to run 1 mile, it will take her 16 * 4 = 64 minutes to run 4 miles.

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The cost price for 50 watermelons is $80. To find the total selling price, we calculate 125% of $80:

Total Selling Price = 125% of $80
Total Selling Price = 1.25 * $80
Total Selling Price = $100

Now, to find the selling price per watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( c \) as the number of chickens,
- \( k \) as the number of cows.

We know that:
1. The total number of animals is 20, so \( c + k = 20 \).
2. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70, so \( 2c + 4k = 70 \).

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of \( c \) and \( k \).

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know there are 15 cows, we can substitute \( k \) back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 20 - 15 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.
