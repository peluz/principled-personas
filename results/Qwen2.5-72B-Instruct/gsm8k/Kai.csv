"To determine Josh's profit, we need to calculate the final value of the house after the repairs and then subtract the total cost (purchase price plus repair costs) from this value.

The value of the house increased by 150% due to the repairs. This means the value of the house after repairs is 250% of the original value (100% original value + 150% increase).

First, we calculate the 250% of the original value of the house:
250% of $80,000 = 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000

This is the new value of the house after the repairs. Now, we need to calculate the total cost Josh incurred:
Total cost = Purchase price + Repair costs
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
Profit = New value of the house - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

So, Josh's profit is $70,000.

"James runs 3 sprints each session, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. To find the total meters he runs a week, we can multiply the number of sprints per session by the distance of each sprint and then multiply that by the number of sessions per week.

So, the calculation is:

3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint * 3 sessions/week

Now, let's do the math:

3 * 60 * 3 = 540 meters

James runs a total of 540 meters a week.

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to calculate the total amount of feed required for the day and then subtract the amount already given in the morning and afternoon meals.

Each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily requirement is:
20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups

Wendi has already given:
15 cups in the morning + 25 cups in the afternoon = 40 cups

The remaining amount of feed needed for the final meal is:
60 cups (total daily requirement) - 40 cups (already given) = 20 cups

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To calculate the total cost for 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: every first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

We can pair the glasses into sets of two, with each set costing $5 (for the first glass) + $3 (for the second glass) = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide this number by 2 to find out how many sets of two glasses he will buy:
16 glasses / 2 glasses per set = 8 sets.

Now, we multiply the number of sets by the cost per set to find the total cost:
8 sets * $8 per set = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) sheep.

Now, to find the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together, we add the number of sheep in each city:

\( 20 \) (Seattle) + \( 80 \) (Charleston) + \( 160 \) (Toulouse) = \( 260 \) sheep.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file, including the time lost due to the Windows update.

1. First, we calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file:
   40% of 200 GB is 0.40 * 200 GB = 80 GB.

2. Since Carla downloads at a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is:
   80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

3. After the download is interrupted, Windows forces a restart which takes 20 minutes.

4. After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning, so she will download the full 200 GB again at the same rate of 2 GB/minute:
   200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

5. The total time to download the file, including the interruption, is the sum of the time to download 40% of the file, the time for the Windows update, and the time to download the full file again:
   40 minutes (for 80 GB) + 20 minutes (for the update) + 100 minutes (for 200 GB) = 160 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is 160 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance John travels in each segment of his trip and then determine how far he is from home at the end of the 4 hours.

1. First, we calculate the distance John travels away from home:
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. Now, we calculate the distance John travels back home:
   - He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles.
   - He then drives for half an hour at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - For the remaining time (4 hours total - 2.5 hours already spent = 1.5 hours), he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. We add the distances he traveled back home:
   - Total distance back home = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

4. Finally, we calculate how far he is from home:
   - Distance from home = Distance away from home - Distance back home
   - Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider both her regular pay for the first 40 hours and her overtime pay for the additional hours she worked.

1. Calculate the regular pay for the first 40 hours:
   Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour

2. Calculate the number of overtime hours:
   Overtime hours = Total hours worked - 40 hours

3. Calculate the overtime pay rate:
   Overtime pay rate = Regular hourly rate * 1.2

4. Calculate the overtime pay:
   Overtime pay = Overtime hours * Overtime pay rate

5. Calculate the total earnings:
   Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay

Now, let's do the math:

Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400
Overtime hours = 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours
Overtime pay rate = $10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour
Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

First month: 60 downloads
Second month: 3 times the first month, so 3 * 60 = 180 downloads
Third month: 30% reduction from the second month, so 180 - (0.30 * 180) = 180 - 54 = 126 downloads

Now, we add the downloads from all three months together:
60 (first month) + 180 (second month) + 126 (third month) = 366 downloads

"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. The cost of 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen:
   3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204

2. The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen:
   2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160

3. The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen:
   6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330

Now, we add up the costs to get the total:
$204 + $160 + $330 = $694

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and then see how many years it will take for the cumulative net profit to cover the initial planting cost.

The initial cost to plant the tree is $90.

Each year, the tree will produce 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each, so the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
7 lemons * $1.5/lemon = $10.5

The annual cost to water and feed the tree is $3.

The net profit per year is the annual revenue minus the annual cost:
$10.5 - $3 = $7.5

To find out how many years it will take to cover the initial cost of $90, we divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:
$90 / $7.5 = 12

So, it will take 12 years for the net profit to cover the initial planting cost. However, at the end of the 12th year, he will have just covered the cost, not started earning money. Therefore, he will start earning money in the 13th year.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with be \( x \).
2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there.
3. After the green house, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
5. At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.
6. After the orange house, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left, so the remaining amount is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \).

Now we can set up the equation and solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
\]

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
\]

Add 2 to both sides:

\[
\frac{2x}{3} = 12
\]

Multiply both sides by 3/2 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 12 \times \frac{3}{2}
\]

\[
x = 18
\]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

1. Calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance.
2. Subtract the number of contemporary dance students from the total to find the remaining students.
3. Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students.
4. Subtract the number of jazz dance students from the remaining students to find the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
5. Calculate the percentage of the entire class that is enrolled in hip-hop dance.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Number of students in contemporary dance: 20% of 20 students = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students
2. Remaining students after contemporary dance: 20 - 4 = 16 students
3. Number of students in jazz dance: 25% of 16 students = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students
4. Remaining students for hip-hop dance: 16 - 4 = 12 students
5. Percentage of students in hip-hop dance: (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her weekly earnings from both jobs and then multiply by the number of weeks she works in a year.

First, we calculate her weekly earnings from teaching:
$20 per hour * 35 hours per week = $700 per week

Next, we calculate her weekly earnings from cheerleading coaching:
$30 per hour * 15 hours per week = $450 per week

Now, we add the two weekly earnings to find her total weekly income:
$700 per week (teaching) + $450 per week (coaching) = $1150 per week

Finally, we multiply her total weekly income by the number of weeks she works in a year to find her annual salary:
$1150 per week * 50 weeks per year = $57,500 per year

Jill's annual salary is $57,500."

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Marissa should take to hike the 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.
2. Calculate the time Marissa has already spent hiking.
3. Determine the remaining time she has to complete the trail.
4. Calculate the remaining distance she has to hike.
5. Determine the speed required to cover the remaining distance in the remaining time.

Step 1: Total time to hike 12 miles at 4 miles per hour:
Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Step 2: Time already spent hiking:
Time for first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time for next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent = 1 hour + 1 hour
Total time spent = 2 hours

Step 3: Remaining time to complete the trail:
Remaining time = Total time - Time already spent
Remaining time = 3 hours - 2 hours
Remaining time = 1 hour

Step 4: Remaining distance to hike:
Total distance = 12 miles
Distance already hiked = 4 miles + 2 miles
Distance already hiked = 6 miles
Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance already hiked
Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles
Remaining distance = 6 miles

Step 5: Speed required to cover the remaining distance in the remaining time:
Required speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Required speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Required speed = 6 miles per hour

Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire trail.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in both the orange drink and the pineapple drink, and then sum them up after accounting for the spill.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink before the spill:

- The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in it is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 \) liters.

Now, let's calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:

- The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in it is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 \) liters.

Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, we need to subtract the water content of that 1 liter from the total water content of the orange drink:

- The amount of water in 1 liter of orange drink is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 1 \) liter.

Now, let's do the calculations:

Water in 10 liters of orange drink before spill: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters
Water in 1 liter of spilled orange drink: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 1 = \frac{2}{3} \) liters
Water in 9 liters of remaining orange drink: \( \frac{20}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) liters

Water in 15 liters of pineapple drink: \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) liters

Total water in the 24 liters of mixed drink: \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) liters

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 15 liters.

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up the equation based on the information that Kyle bought the book at a 25% discount. If the original price is \( P \), then the price Kyle paid is \( P - 0.25P \) or \( 0.75P \).

We know that \( 0.75P = 19.50 \). To find \( P \), we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now we calculate the value of \( P \):

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to calculate the total cost of the other items she bought and subtract that from the total amount she paid. Then we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of one box of pizza to find out how many boxes she ordered.

The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

Now, let's add up the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
$12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50, so the amount spent on pizza is:
$50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is:
$17 / $8.50 = 2.

Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and their total age.

Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162, so we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

Now, we solve for \(x\):

\[x = \frac{162}{18}\]
\[x = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find Allen's current age:

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's age 10 years from now will be:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

"To find the average guess, we need to first determine what each friend guessed and then calculate the mean of those guesses.

The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.

The second friend guessed 20 more than half the first one's guess:
Half of the first guess is 80 / 2 = 40.
So, the second guess is 40 + 20 = 60.

The third friend guessed 25% more than the first one's guess:
25% of the first guess is 80 * 0.25 = 20.
So, the third guess is 80 + 20 = 100.

Now we have the three guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add the guesses together and divide by the number of guesses:
Average = (80 + 60 + 100) / 3
Average = 240 / 3
Average = 80

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two equations:

1. The total number of coins is 110:
   \( S + G = 110 \)

2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins:
   \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( S \):

\( S + (S + 30) = 110 \)
\( 2S + 30 = 110 \)
\( 2S = 110 - 30 \)
\( 2S = 80 \)
\( S = 40 \)

Now that we know there are 40 silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins by using the second equation:

\( G = S + 30 \)
\( G = 40 + 30 \)
\( G = 70 \)

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels and then add 5 to find out how many jewels Aaron has:
   Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20
   Aaron's jewels = 20 + 5 = 25
3. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has to find out how many jewels Siobhan has:
   Siobhan's jewels = 25 - 2 = 23

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"To find out how many total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes and then add them to the points he scored in the first 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points that is, we calculate 25% of 4 points and then add that to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 points is:
0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So in the second 20 minutes, he scored:
4 points + 1 point = 5 points

Now, we add the points from both sessions to get the total points:
4 points (first 20 minutes) + 5 points (second 20 minutes) = 9 points

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points.

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine the cost per yogurt based on the sale price.
3. Calculate the total cost for the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.

Step 1: Total number of yogurts in 30 days
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Step 2: Cost per yogurt
The sale price is 4 yogurts for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is:
$5.00 / 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Step 3: Total cost for 30 days

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed. Speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time.

John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week, with 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days.

First, let's find out how many hours he runs on the other two days:
- He runs 3 hours on the first day.
- He runs half as much on the other two days, so that's 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours he runs in a week:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours
- Total hours: 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Now we can calculate his average speed:
- Total distance: 60 miles
- Total time: 6 hours
- Average speed: 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour

So, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds, and then calculate the distance she can travel in six hours given the time spent running and walking.

1. Determine Dana's running speed:
Since Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, and she can skip at 3 miles per hour, her running speed is twice her skipping speed.
Running speed = 3 mph * 2 = 6 mph

2. Determine Dana's walking speed:
Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, so her walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed.
Walking speed = 6 mph / 4 = 1.5 mph

3. Calculate the time spent running and walking:
Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking over a six-hour period.
Time spent running = 6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours
Time spent walking = 6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours

4. Calculate the distance traveled running and walking:
Distance running = Running speed * Time spent running = 6 mph * 2 hours = 12 miles
Distance walking = Walking speed * Time spent walking = 1.5 mph * 4 hours = 6 miles

5. Calculate the total distance traveled:
Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles

The final numerical answer is:

"When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than her normal throwing distance. Her normal throwing distance is 400 feet, so with the gemstone, she can throw the javelin:

400 feet * 3 = 1200 feet

The dragon, Perg, can breathe fire up to a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside of the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's flame reach from Polly's throwing distance with the gemstone:

1200 feet - 1000 feet = 200 feet

Polly can stand 200 feet outside of the dragon's flame reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips.
2. Calculate the number of calories per gram of chips.
3. Determine how many calories you have left to consume for the day.
4. Calculate how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories.

Step 1: Total calories in the 300g bag
Since there are 5 servings in the bag and each serving has 250 calories, the total number of calories in the bag is:
5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories

Step 2: Calories per gram of chips
The bag is 300g, so the number of calories per gram is:
1250 calories / 300g = 4.1667 calories/gram

Step 3: Remaining calories for the day
You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories, so the remaining calories are:
2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories

Step 4: Grams of chips you can eat
To find out how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per gram:
200 calories / 4.1667 calories/gram ≈ 48 grams

So, you can eat approximately 48 grams of chips.

"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total cost of making the candles and the total revenue from selling them.

First, we need to find out how many pounds of beeswax are required to make 20 candles. Since 1 pound of beeswax can make 10 candles, we can calculate the pounds of beeswax needed as follows:

20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds of beeswax

Next, we calculate the total cost of the beeswax and wicks for 2 pounds:

2 pounds * $10.00 per pound = $20.00

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:

20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00

Finally, we calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

$40.00 (revenue) - $20.00 (cost) = $20.00 (net profit)

"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to determine the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the average time it takes to write one article.

1. On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
2. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote 5 + (2/5 * 5) articles. Let's calculate that:
   \( 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
3. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is:
   \( 2 * 7 = 14 \) articles.

Now, we can calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\( 5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 \) articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent is:
\( 26 \text{ articles} * 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours} \).

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes and then bought a package with an unknown number of Post-it notes, which we'll call \( x \). She used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 left over. The total number of Post-it notes she had before using them is the sum of the Post-it notes she started with and the ones she bought. After using 220, she had 23 left, so the equation is:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 23 + 220 - 80 \]
\[ x = 243 - 80 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the package that Candice purchased contained 163 Post-it notes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find out how many blue ties he bought, we divide the total amount spent by the cost per tie:
   Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
   Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
   Number of blue ties = 5

2. John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. So, the number of red ties is:
   Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
   Number of red ties = 2 * 5
   Number of red ties = 10

3. The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. The cost of a blue tie is $40, so the cost of a red tie is:
   Cost of red tie = Cost of blue tie + (50% of Cost of blue tie)
   Cost of red tie = $40 + (0.5 * $40)
   Cost of red tie = $40 + $20
   Cost of red tie = $60

4. To find out how much he spent on red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost per red tie:
   Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of red tie
   Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60
   Total spent on red ties = $600

5. To find out the total amount spent on all ties, we add the amount spent on blue ties to the amount spent on red ties:
   Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
   Total spent on ties = $200 + $600
   Total spent on ties = $800

The final numerical answer is:

Now, we calculate the total number of inches in 4 feet and divide by 6 inches to find the number of pieces.

4 * 12 inches / 6 inches = number of pieces

Let's do the math:

4 * 12 = 48 inches
48 inches / 6 inches = 8 pieces

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Step 1: Total number of units in the building
Total units = Number of floors * Units per floor
Total units = 15 floors * 8 units/floor
Total units = 120 units

Step 2: Number of occupied units
Occupied units = Total units * Occupancy rate
Occupied units = 120 units * 3/4
Occupied units = 90 units

Step 3: Number of unoccupied units
Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 120 units - 90 units
Unoccupied units = 30 units

"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
2. Calculate the daily income from selling the eggs.
3. Multiply the daily income by the number of days in a week to get the weekly income.

Step 1: Number of dozens of eggs produced per day
There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.
252 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 21 dozens per day

Step 2: Daily income from selling the eggs
Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, so we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen.
21 dozens * $2 per dozen = $42 per day

Step 3: Weekly income
There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily income by 7 to find the weekly income.
$42 per day * 7 days per week = $294 per week

Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM and then calculate the time it takes for him to travel back at a different speed.

First, we calculate the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels for 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour, the distance is:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 mph * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel back 30 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour. We use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

Now, Uriah still needs to remove more weight to reach the total of 15 pounds. Let's find out how much more weight he needs to remove:

15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds

Next, we need to determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove to get rid of the remaining 7.5 pounds. Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so:

7.5 pounds / (1/2 pound per toy) = 7.5 * 2 = 15 toys

Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

"To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the revenue for both Thursday and Friday and then find the difference.

For Thursday:
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each, so the revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.
- The mechanic also repairs 4 car tires at $40 each, so the revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160.
- The total revenue for Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

For Friday:
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each, so the revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
- There are no truck tires repaired, so the revenue from truck tires is $0.
- The total revenue for Friday is $480 + $0 = $480.

Now, we find the difference in revenue between the two days:
- The difference is $520 (Thursday) - $480 (Friday) = $40.

The mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday.

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after accounting for the weight of the driver and the empty truck. Then, we divide this remaining capacity by the weight of each box.

The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. The weight of each box is 15 pounds.

First, we calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge:

5000 pounds (bridge limit) - 3755 pounds (driver and truck) = 1245 pounds (remaining capacity)

Next, we determine how many boxes can be loaded:

1245 pounds (remaining capacity) / 15 pounds (per box) = 83 boxes

Since we can't load a fraction of a box, we round down to the nearest whole number.

83
However, since we need to ensure we do not exceed the weight limit, we should check if 83 boxes would indeed be within the limit:

83 boxes * 15 pounds/box = 1245 pounds

Adding this to the weight of the driver and the empty truck:

1245 pounds (boxes) + 3755 pounds (driver and truck) = 5000 pounds

This is exactly the bridge's weight limit, so 83 boxes is the correct maximum number.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency and then use that to determine the total distance she can travel on a full tank.

First, we calculate the fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg) based on the information that she traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas:

Fuel efficiency (mpg) = Distance traveled (miles) / Amount of gas used (gallons)
Fuel efficiency (mpg) = 100 miles / 4 gallons
Fuel efficiency (mpg) = 25 mpg

Now that we know her car's fuel efficiency is 25 miles per gallon, we can calculate the total distance she can travel on a full tank of 12 gallons:

Total distance (miles) = Fuel efficiency (mpg) * Tank capacity (gallons)
Total distance (miles) = 25 mpg * 12 gallons
Total distance (miles) = 300 miles

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

   - Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2
   - Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2

2. Calculate the total sales for each type of flower:
   - Marigolds: 12 pots * $3 = $36
   - Petunias: 9 pots * $2 = $18
   - Begonias: 17 pots * $2 = $34

3. Sum up the total sales:
   - Total sales = $36 + $18 + $34 = $88

So, Artie will make $88.

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-leveled sandcastle, we need to determine the square footage of each level and then calculate the average.

Given that each level has half the square footage of the level below it, and the top level (4th level) has a square footage of 16, we can work our way down to find the square footage of the other levels.

- 4th level: 16 square feet
- 3rd level: 16 * 2 = 32 square feet
- 2nd level: 32 * 2 = 64 square feet
- 1st level: 64 * 2 = 128 square feet

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels to find the average:

Total square footage = 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet

Number of levels = 4

Average square footage per level = Total square footage / Number of levels = 240 / 4 = 60 square feet

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in that time and then divide by the number of cups per bag.

First, we need to know how many days are in a year. A standard year has 365 days.

For the first 180 days, the puppy will eat 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of food for the first 180 days is:
180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups

For the remaining days of the year (365 - 180 = 185 days), the puppy will eat 2 cups of dog food per day. So, the total amount of food for the remaining 185 days is:
185 days * 2 cups/day = 370 cups

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total amount of dog food for the first year:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Each bag of dog food contains 110 cups. To find out how many bags Cecilia will need, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups per bag:
550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does 1/4 of what Sarah does.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.

First, we calculate how much laundry David does:
David's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 4
David's laundry = 400 pounds / 4
David's laundry = 100 pounds

Next, we calculate how much laundry Raymond does:
Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
Raymond's laundry = 400 pounds / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

Now, we find the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David:
Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
Difference = 200 pounds - 100 pounds
Difference = 100 pounds

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds.

"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying the flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 with the cost of buying them in packages of 2 for $1.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- 18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages
- 6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- 18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages
- 9 packages * $1.00 per package = $9.00

The difference in cost between the two options is:
- $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00

So, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

"Two girls each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, so each girl got:

24 liters * (1/6) = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, they got a total of:

4 liters * 2 = 8 liters

The boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy is:

8 liters + 6 liters = 14 liters

The total amount of water was 24 liters, so the amount of water left is:

24 liters - 14 liters = 10 liters

"Charlie started with 10 stickers, then added 21 from the store and 23 from his birthday, which gives:

10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers

Then he gave away 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 to decorate a greeting card, which means he gave away a total of:

9 + 28 = 37 stickers

Subtracting the stickers he gave away from the total he had, we get:

54 - 37 = 17 stickers

So, Charlie has 17 stickers left.

"To find the combined weight of Grace and Alex, we first need to determine Alex's weight based on the information given.

Grace's weight is 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. So, we calculate 4 times Grace's weight and then subtract 2 pounds to find Alex's weight:

4 * 125 - 2 = 500 - 2 = 498 pounds

Now, we add Grace's weight to Alex's weight to find their combined weight:

125 + 498 = 623 pounds

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as W and the number of games they lost as L. According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so we have:

W + L = 22

It's also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us:

W = L + 8

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for L:

(L + 8) + L = 22
2L + 8 = 22
2L = 22 - 8
2L = 14
L = 14 / 2
L = 7

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find out how many they won by using the second equation:

W = L + 8
W = 7 + 8
W = 15

The team won 15 games.

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to apply the 10% increase to her initial monthly salary of $600 for each of the three years following her 5-year mark.

First, let's calculate her monthly salary after the first 10% increase:
$600 + ($600 * 10%) = $600 + $60 = $660

Now, we apply the 10% increase for the second year:
$660 + ($660 * 10%) = $660 + $66 = $726

And for the third year:
$726 + ($726 * 10%) = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Now, to find her annual salary, we multiply her monthly salary after three years by 12 (months in a year):
$798.60 * 12 = $9,583.20

Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is:
$9,583.20"
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, which we can denote as \( 10H \).

The total number of copies sold by both is 88,000, so we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find the number of copies Harald sold, we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"To find out how much Christina will spend on gift bags, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of guests that will actually show up by accounting for the 1/4 that don't show up.
2. Determine the number of gift bags needed based on the number of guests that will show up.
3. Calculate the total cost of the gift bags.

Step 1: Calculate the number of guests that will show up.
Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, 3/4 of the attendees will show up. So, we calculate 3/4 of 16 friends:
\( \frac{3}{4} \times 16 = 12 \) guests will show up.

Step 2: Determine the number of gift bags needed.
Christina needs .75 gift bags per guest, so for 12 guests:
\( 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \) gift bags are needed.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the gift bags.
Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost will be:
\( 9 \times 2 = 18 \) dollars.

Christina will spend 18 dollars on gift bags.

"To find out how many pounds of potato salad Ted the T-Rex needs to bring to the picnic, we can calculate the total amount of potato salad that will be consumed by the adults and the children.

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad the adults will eat:
- Each adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.
- So, the total for adults is 10 lbs/adult * 20 adults = 200 lbs.

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad the children will eat:
- Each child will eat half as much as an adult, so each child will eat 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 5 children.
- So, the total for children is 5 lbs/child * 5 children = 25 lbs.

Now, we add the total amount of potato salad for adults and children to find the total amount needed:
- Total potato salad needed = 200 lbs (adults) + 25 lbs (children) = 225 lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.

From point 4, we can determine Corey's age:
James (10 years) + 1 year = Corey's age
Corey is 11 years old.

From point 2, we can determine Amy's age:
Corey (11 years) - 2 years = Amy's age
Amy is 9 years old.

From point 1, we can determine Jackson's age:
Amy (9 years) - 5 years = Jackson's age
Jackson is 4 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Gerald's original time for the 400-meter hurdles and then calculate his improved time after the 10% speed increase.

1. Let's denote Gerald's original time as \( G \) seconds.
2. Lee's time is 2 seconds faster than Gerald's original time, so Lee's time is \( G - 2 \) seconds.
3. We are given that Lee's time is 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation \( G - 2 = 38 \).
4. Solving for \( G \), we get \( G = 38 + 2 = 40 \) seconds. This is Gerald's original time.
5. Gerald's speed improved by 10%, which means his new time is 90% of his original time (since a 10% increase in speed results in a 10% decrease in time).
6. To find the new time, we calculate \( 0.9 \times G \), which is \( 0.9 \times 40 = 36 \) seconds.

Gerald, with his improved diet, can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that the number of dogs is 60.
2. Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats is 2 times the number of dogs. So, the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120.
3. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, the number of rabbits is (number of dogs + number of cats) - 12. This means the number of rabbits is (60 + 120) - 12 = 168.
4. To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits together: 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits).

Now, let's calculate the total:

60 + 120 + 168 = 348

"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to calculate how long James slept. James slept 2/3 of the time Harry did, so we multiply Harry's sleep time by 2/3:

James' sleep time = Harry's sleep time * 2/3
James' sleep time = 9 hours * 2/3
James' sleep time = 6 hours

Now we subtract James' sleep time from Harry's sleep time to find the difference:

Difference = Harry's sleep time - James' sleep time
Difference = 9 hours - 6 hours
Difference = 3 hours

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the original volume of tomatoes before cooking.
2. Calculate how many cans of tomatoes were used.
3. Convert the number of cans into the number of tomatoes.

Since the sauce loses half its volume when cooked, the original volume of the tomatoes before cooking must have been twice the volume of the sauce. Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces, so the original volume of tomatoes was:

32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces

Each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces, so the number of cans used is:

64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans

Since each can contains three tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:

4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
- Some cars drove through in the first 15 minutes.
- 20 more cars drove through in the next 15 minutes.
- 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.

We need to find out how many cars drove through in the first 15 minutes. Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that were not part of the traffic jam is 5.

The total number of cars that were originally on the motorway is the sum of the cars that drove through, the cars that took an exit, and the cars that remained in the traffic jam. However, we are not given the number of cars that remained in the traffic jam, so we will not need this information to solve the problem.

We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ \text{Total cars} = \text{Cars that drove through} + \text{Cars that took an exit} \]
\[ 30 = (x + 20) + 5 \]

Now we can solve for \( x \):

\[ 30 = x + 20 + 5 \]
\[ 30 = x + 25 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much water the boat took on while Julia was rowing back to shore.

First, we need to find out how far Julia rowed in 64 seconds. We know that she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. We can set up a proportion to find out how many feet she rows in 64 seconds:

20 feet / 16 seconds = X feet / 64 seconds

Solving for X gives us:

X = (20 feet * 64 seconds) / 16 seconds
X = (1280 feet*seconds) / 16 seconds
X = 80 feet

Now that we know Julia rowed 80 feet, we can calculate how much water the boat took on. We know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. We can set up another proportion to find out how many liters of water the boat took on for 80 feet:

2 liters / 10 feet = Y liters / 80 feet

Solving for Y gives us:

Y = (2 liters * 80 feet) / 10 feet
Y = (160 liters*feet) / 10 feet
Y = 16 liters

So, by the time Julia reached shore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
3. Therefore, Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.
4. The number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
5. Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 300 / 50 = 6.

The number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 6."
"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to determine the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue she will make from selling it at the new increased price.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:

- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each: 10 * $10 = $100
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each: 5 * $16 = $80

Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180

Next, we calculate the selling price of each type of board after the 50% price increase:

- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards: $10 + ($10 * 50%) = $10 + $5 = $15 each
- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: $16 + ($16 * 50%) = $16 + $8 = $24 each

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the boards:

- Revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10 * $15 = $150
- Revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 * $24 = $120

Total revenue = $150 + $120 = $270

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many parts of the total mixture correspond to the sugar, based on the given ratio of 7:13 (sugar to water).

First, we add the parts of the ratio together to find the total number of parts in the mixture:
7 (sugar) + 13 (water) = 20 parts

Next, we know that the total mixture is 120 units (teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined). We can now find out how many units each part of the ratio represents:
120 units / 20 parts = 6 units per part

Since the sugar is 7 parts of the mixture, we can calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used by multiplying the number of units per part by the number of parts for sugar:
7 parts * 6 units/part = 42 units

Therefore, Katy used 42 teaspoonfuls of sugar.

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we first need to determine the total number of vehicles that were added to the port on that day. We know that initially, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, which totals to 10 vehicles. The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30.

The number of vehicles added on the second day is:
30 (total vehicles) - 10 (initial vehicles) = 20 vehicles

Since each container holds 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
20 vehicles / 5 vehicles per container = 4 containers

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.
2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
4. Add both salaries to get the total salary the two were receiving four years later.

Step 1: Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.
Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. If Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, we can set up the equation to find Lylah's salary (L):

\( 40,000 = L + 0.30L \)
\( 40,000 = 1.30L \)
\( L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \)
\( L = 30,769.23 \) (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what he was making four years ago. So his new salary (A_new) is:

\( A_{new} = 40,000 + 0.40 \times 40,000 \)
\( A_{new} = 40,000 + 16,000 \)
\( A_{new} = 56,000 \)

Step 3: Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
Since Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume that Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. So her new salary (L_new) is:

\( L_{new} = 30,769.23 + 0.40 \times 30,769.23 \)
\( L_{new} = 30,769.23 + 12,307.69 \)
\( L_{new} = 43,076.92 \) (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 4: Add both salaries to get the total salary the two were receiving four years later.
Total salary (T) is:

\( T = A_{new} + L_{new} \)
\( T = 56,000 + 43,076.92 \)
\( T = 99,076.92 \)

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,076.92.

"To calculate the profit the hospital makes from these visits, we need to determine the total revenue and the total cost, and then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the total revenue:
- The hospital charges patients $200 per hour.
- Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, which is 24/60 = 0.4 hours.
- The revenue per patient is therefore 0.4 hours * $200/hour = $80.
- With 500 patients a day, the total revenue is 500 patients * $80/patient = $40,000.

Next, let's calculate the total cost:
- The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour.
- The cost per patient is 0.4 hours * $150/hour = $60.
- With 500 patients a day, the total cost is 500 patients * $60/patient = $30,000.

Finally, we calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
- Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits per day.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. We can subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total to find the number of semi-automatic cars.

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Number of semi-automatic cars = 4

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables:

- Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) represent the number of worker bees.

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many babies as queens: \( B = 2Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the worker bees, baby bees, and queens:

\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting the relationships into the total number of bees equation, we get:

\[ 2B + B + \frac{B}{2} = 700 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 3B + \frac{B}{2} = 700 \]

To solve for \( B \), we first need to combine the terms on the left side of the equation. To do this, we can find a common denominator, which is 2:

\[ \frac{6B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} = 700 \]

\[ \frac{7B}{2} = 700 \]

Now, multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

\[ 7B = 1400 \]

Divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( B \):

\[ B = 200 \]

Now that we have the number of baby bees, we can find the number of worker bees using the relationship \( W = 2B \):

\[ W = 2 \times 200 \]

\[ W = 400 \]

So, there are 400 worker bees in the hive.

After the ants carried off 1 fry, there were \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 \) fries left, which we know is 5 fries.

So we have the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5 \]

Let's solve for \( x \):

\[ \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 5 + 1 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6 \]
\[ x - 30 = 6 * 3 \]
\[ x - 30 = 18 \]
\[ x = 18 + 30 \]
\[ x = 48 \]

So, the original number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 48.

"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to determine the number of hours he spends in class each week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in the semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes, each 1 hour long, so:
3 days * 3 hours/day = 9 hours

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each 2 hours long, so:
2 days * 2 hours/class * 2 classes/day = 8 hours

Adding the hours from all days of the week, we get:
9 hours (MWF) + 8 hours (TTh) = 17 hours per week

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is:
17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours

"To find the total length of all the baked goods in feet, we need to convert the lengths of the rolls and croissants from inches to feet and then add the lengths of all the items together.

There are 12 inches in a foot.

First, we convert the length of the rolls:
- Each roll is 4 inches long, so 300 rolls will be 300 * 4 inches.
- In feet, that is (300 * 4) / 12 feet.

Next, we convert the length of the croissants:
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, so 120 croissants will be 120 * 6 inches.
- In feet, that is (120 * 6) / 12 feet.

The baguettes are already given in feet:
- Each baguette is 2 feet long, so 60 baguettes will be 60 * 2 feet.

Now we add the lengths together to get the total length in feet.

Let's do the calculations:

Rolls in feet: (300 * 4) / 12 = 1200 / 12 = 100 feet
Croissants in feet: (120 * 6) / 12 = 720 / 12 = 60 feet
Baguettes in feet: 60 * 2 = 120 feet

Total length in feet: 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 feet

"To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we need to calculate the total monthly banana requirement for all the apes and then multiply that by 2.

Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

Total bananas needed per month = 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons)
Total bananas needed per month = 700 bananas

For 2 months, the zookeeper needs to order:
700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance each person runs and then find the difference.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each back and forth is 200 yards (100 yards there and 100 yards back). So, Blake's total distance is:
15 times * 200 yards/time = 3000 yards

Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field, and then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. The distance to the 40-yard line and back is 80 yards (40 yards there and 40 yards back). So, Kelly's total distance is:
1 time * 200 yards/time + 34 times * 80 yards/time = 200 yards + 2720 yards = 2920 yards

Now, we find the difference between the distances run by Blake and Kelly:
3000 yards - 2920 yards = 80 yards

The winner runs 80 yards farther than the loser.

"To find the tank's water depth on Wednesday, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the water depth on Tuesday by adding 7 feet to the depth on Monday.
2. Calculate the water depth on Wednesday by finding two thirds of the depth on Tuesday.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Depth on Tuesday = Depth on Monday + 7 feet
   Depth on Tuesday = 17 feet + 7 feet
   Depth on Tuesday = 24 feet

2. Depth on Wednesday = (2/3) * Depth on Tuesday
   Depth on Wednesday = (2/3) * 24 feet
   Depth on Wednesday = 16 feet

So, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"To find out how many fish Anakin and Locsin caught, we need to calculate the total for each of them and then add those totals together.

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which is 10 - 5 = 5 starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which is 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which is 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish

Now, let's add up the total number of fish each of them caught:

Anakin's total:
10 (starfish) + 6 (sea horses) + 3 (clownfish) = 19 fish

Locsin's total:
5 (starfish) + 3 (sea horses) + 5 (clownfish) = 13 fish

Combined total:
19 (Anakin's fish) + 13 (Locsin's fish) = 32 fish

So, the total number of fish they were able to catch is 32.

"To find the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the effect of the 20% price increase that occurs every two months over the 36-month period.

First, let's determine how many 2-month periods there are in 36 months:
36 months / 2 months per period = 18 periods

Each period, the price increases by 20% of the original price, which means the price is multiplied by 1.20 (100% + 20% = 120% = 1.20) for each period.

The formula to calculate the final price after n periods is:
Final Price = Original Price * (1 + Rate of Increase) ^ Number of Periods

Plugging in the values:
Final Price = $20 * (1.20) ^ 18

Now, let's calculate the final price:
Final Price = $20 * (1.20) ^ 18
Final Price = $20 * 38.3376 (rounded to four decimal places)
Final Price = $766.752 (rounded to three decimal places)

The final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is $766.752, which we can round to the nearest cent if necessary.

"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then sum them up.

1. The cost of one red car is $4, so the cost of 5 red cars is:
   5 red cars * $4/red car = $20

2. The cost of one action figure is $5, so the cost of 3 action figures is:
   3 action figures * $5/action figure = $15

3. The cost of the doll is the same as 3 action figures, which is:
   3 action figures * $5/action figure = $15

Now, we add up the costs of all the toys:
$20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50

The total worth of all the toys is $50.

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the cost of hiring the accountant with the income she would lose by doing her taxes herself.

If Jackie does her taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work at $35 per hour. The total lost income would be:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

The difference in cost between doing the taxes herself (in terms of lost income) and hiring the accountant is:

$105 (lost income) - $90 (accountant's fee) = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"Let's denote Seth's current age as \( S \) and Brooke's current age as \( B \).

According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the equation:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \) and Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the equation:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now we can substitute \( S \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:
\[ S = 2B \]
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

So Seth is currently 16 years old.

J = 2 * 8 + 2
J = 16 + 2
J = 18

So, Jimmy has $18.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants, and then add them together.

1. The cost of the hat is given as $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so the pants cost (hat cost + jacket cost) / 2 = ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:

Total cost = hat cost + jacket cost + pants cost
Total cost = $25 + $75 + $50
Total cost = $150

"To calculate how much Jessica will pay in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum on all her debts, we first need to determine the total minimum monthly payment and then calculate 50% more than that amount. After that, we multiply the increased monthly payment by 12 to get the annual total.

1. Calculate the total minimum monthly payment:
   Student loans: $300
   Credit card: $200
   Mortgage: $500
   Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

2. Calculate 50% more than the total minimum monthly payment:
   50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500
   Increased monthly payment = $1000 + $500 = $1500

60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes per potato = 90 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes to cut all the potatoes:
60 potatoes * 5 seconds per potato = 300 seconds

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert the cutting time to minutes:
300 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 5 minutes

Now, we add the peeling time and the cutting time together to get the total time:
90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to first determine how many gallons of lemonade they sold to make a $25 profit.

Let's break down the costs and revenue:
- Cost per gallon for lemons: $3
- Cost per gallon for sugar: $2
- Total cost per gallon: $3 + $2 = $5
- Revenue per glass: $0.50
- Number of glasses per gallon: 20
- Revenue per gallon: 20 glasses * $0.50/glass = $10

Now, let's calculate the profit per gallon:
- Profit per gallon: Revenue per gallon - Cost per gallon = $10 - $5 = $5

To make a $25 profit, they would need to sell:
- Number of gallons to make $25 profit: $25 / $5 per gallon = 5 gallons

Since they need 5 gallons to make a $25 profit, the amount spent on lemons would be:
- Cost of lemons for 5 gallons: 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

So, they spent $15 on lemons.

2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
3. Jan is currently 30 years old.

First, we need to find out how old Jan was two years ago:
Jan's age two years ago = 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Now, we can use the second piece of information to find out Mark's age two years ago:
Mark's age two years ago = (1/2 * Jan's age two years ago) + 5
Mark's age two years ago = (1/2 * 28) + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 14 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 19 years old.

Now we can find out Mark's current age:
Mark's current age = Mark's age two years ago + 2
Mark's current age = 19 + 2
Mark's current age = 21 years old.

Finally, we can find out Jean's current age using the first piece of information:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[ P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[ P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling two even numbers in a row) is the product of their individual probabilities:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We can do this by dividing the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 by the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row and then converting the result to a percentage.

\[ \text{Likelihood ratio} = \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{4}} = 2 \]

This means that it is 2 times more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we subtract 1 (to find the increase) and then multiply by 100:

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = (2 - 1) \times 100\% = 1 \times 100\% = 100\% \]

So, it is 100% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To find out how many rats are in each cage, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats, hamsters, and rabbits, and then use the information to determine the number of rats.

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters and rabbits:

- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, so the total for the hamsters is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces of straw.
- There is a pen of rabbits with 20 pieces of straw.

Now, let's add the straw given to the hamsters and rabbits:

\(50 + 20 = 70\) pieces of straw.

Since 160 pieces of straw have been distributed in total, we can find out how many pieces of straw were given to the rats by subtracting the straw given to the hamsters and rabbits from the total:

\(160 - 70 = 90\) pieces of straw for the rats.

We know that each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so we can find the total number of rats by dividing the total number of pieces of straw for the rats by the number of pieces each rat gets:

\(90 \div 6 = 15\) rats in total.

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, we can find the number of rats in each cage by dividing the total number of rats by the number of cages:

\(15 \div 3 = 5\) rats in each cage.

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 20x + 2x = 22x \]

The revenue from selling the bags is \( 30x \) dollars (since each bag is sold for $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, and we know the profit is $400:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 400 = 30x - 22x \]
\[ 400 = 8x \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags.

"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide that total by the number of friends.

1. The cost of the tickets is $20.25.
2. The cost of the food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
3. The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, we add up all the costs:
Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66
Total cost = $102

Since there are three friends, we divide the total cost by 3 to find out how much each friend paid:
Amount each friend paid = Total cost / 3
Amount each friend paid = $102 / 3
Amount each friend paid = $34

"To find out how many pounds of insects ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per week for ten ducks.
2. Divide the weekly total by 7 to find the daily requirement.

Step 1: Total weekly requirement for ten ducks
Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, so for ten ducks:
3.5 pounds/duck/week * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week

Step 2: Convert the weekly requirement to a daily requirement
35 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

So, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net increase in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees.
2. Over 10 years, the total increase in trees will be 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.
3. Tom starts with 50 trees, so after 10 years, before any trees die, he will have 50 + 80 = 130 trees.
4. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find out how many trees die, we calculate 30% of 130: 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.
5. The number of trees left after 30% die is 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

So, the final number of trees Tom has left is:

"To find out how much 8 pens will cost, we first need to determine the cost of one pen. We know that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. 

The cost of a pencil is $1.20 and the cost of an eraser is $0.30. So, the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser is:

$1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

This means that one pen costs $1.50. Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

$1.50 * 8 = $12.00

Therefore, 8 pens will cost $12.00.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months, which is 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, to find the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has, we add the initial number of cards to the cards collected in each of the three months:

20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate the total earnings from both publishers.

First, we need to determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we divide the total number of sentences by 2:

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Next, we calculate the earnings from Publisher A. Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, we multiply the number of sentences by the rate:

500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents.

Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so the rate from Publisher B is:

2 * 5 cents/sentence = 10 cents/sentence.

Now we calculate the earnings from Publisher B:

500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents.

Finally, we add the earnings from both publishers to find the total weekly earnings:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents.

"To calculate how much money John made that year after winning the award, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the increased salary due to the 5% raise.

First, let's calculate his new weekly salary after the 5% raise:
New weekly salary = Original weekly salary + (Original weekly salary * Raise percentage)
New weekly salary = $2000 + ($2000 * 0.05)
New weekly salary = $2000 + $100
New weekly salary = $2100

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the year, including the one-time award:
Total earnings = (New weekly salary * Number of weeks in a year) + One-time monetary reward
Total earnings = ($2100 * 52) + $5000
Total earnings = $109,200 + $5000
Total earnings = $114,200

1. Calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year by multiplying the number of acres by the tons of grapes produced per acre.
2. Calculate the total barrels of wine produced by multiplying the total tons of grapes by the number of barrels of wine produced per ton of grapes.

Let's do the math:

1. Total tons of grapes per year = 10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons
2. Total barrels of wine per year = 50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the total for each meal and then sum them up.

For the sandwiches:
- He ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
- Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
- So, for sandwiches, he used 7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices.

For the omelets:
- He ate omelets for breakfast 3 days.
- Each omelet used 1 more slice than each sandwich, so 2 slices + 1 slice = 3 slices per omelet.
- So, for omelets, he used 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices.

For the macaroni and cheese:
- He used 8 slices of cheese in the big dish.

Now, we add up all the slices of cheese used:
- Sandwiches: 14 slices
- Omelets: 9 slices
- Macaroni and cheese: 8 slices

Total slices of cheese used = 14 slices + 9 slices + 8 slices = 31 slices.

3. Calculate the sum of the four highest scores from the first five tests.
4. Determine the score needed on the sixth test to reach the total points required for an average of 93.

First, let's identify the lowest score from the first five tests:
The scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71.

Next, we calculate the total points needed for an average of 93 over five tests:
Total points needed = 93 * 5 = 465

Now, we calculate the sum of the four highest scores from the first five tests:
Sum of four highest scores = 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367

Finally, we determine the score needed on the sixth test:
Score needed on sixth test = Total points needed - Sum of four highest scores
Score needed on sixth test = 465 - 367 = 98

Brinley needs to score 98 on the sixth test to get an average of 93 after removing the lowest score.

- Over four weeks, he rides 4 * 125 = 500 kilometers.

For the following three weeks:
- He rides 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- So, each week he rides 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40g. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g per chocolate bar = 1000g

Next, we need to find the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can find the weight of a candied apple by dividing the weight of a chocolate bar by 2:
40g per chocolate bar / 2 = 20g per candied apple

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the candied apples. There are 80 candied apples, so:
80 candied apples * 20g per candied apple = 1600g

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag:
1000g (chocolate bars) + 1600g (candied apples) = 2600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates.
2. Then, we will calculate the total cost of twenty dozen cups.
3. Finally, we will determine the cost of each cup.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates.
A dozen is 12, so half a dozen is 6.
The cost of one plate is $6000.
The total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of twenty dozen cups.
We know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is the total cost of half a dozen plates minus $1200.

Step 3: Determine the cost of each cup.
A dozen is 12, so twenty dozen is 20 * 12.
The cost of each cup is the total cost of twenty dozen cups divided by the number of cups in twenty dozen.

Let's do the calculations:

Total cost of half a dozen plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000
Total cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800
Number of cups in twenty dozen = 20 * 12 = 240
Cost of each cup = $34800 / 240

Now, let's calculate the cost of each cup:

Cost of each cup = $34800 / 240 = $145

The total cost of buying each cup is $145."
"To find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then determine how much more money she needs after accounting for her savings and babysitting earnings.

The total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is:
$30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70

Sara already has $10 saved, so the remaining amount she needs is:
$70 (total cost) - $10 (savings) = $60

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so her total earnings from babysitting are:
4 * $5 = $20

Now, we subtract her babysitting earnings from the remaining amount she needs:
$60 (remaining amount) - $20 (babysitting earnings) = $40

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn mowed:
$40 / $4 = 10

Sara must mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

According to the problem, we have the following two equations:

1. The total number of eggs collected per day is 42, which is the sum of the eggs produced by the red and white chickens:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

2. There are two more white chickens than red chickens:
\[ W = R + 2 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( R \):

\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle and then divide that by his walking speed.

The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:
P = 2 * (length + width)

Given the dimensions of the park:
Length (L) = 6 miles
Width (W) = 1.5 miles

We can calculate the perimeter as follows:
P = 2 * (6 + 1.5)
P = 2 * 7.5
P = 15 miles

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours (T) he spends walking, we use the formula:
T = Distance / Speed

Substituting the values we have:
T = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
T = 5 hours

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the edge of the park.

2. Determine the number of customers on the second day: 100 customers + 50 more = 150 customers.
3. Calculate the total number of customers for the first two days: 100 customers + 150 customers = 250 customers.
4. We know the total number of customers by the end of the third day is 500.
5. To find the number of customers on the third day, subtract the total number of customers for the first two days from the total by the end of the third day: 500 customers - 250 customers = 250 customers.

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. We know that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the small pool was \( S + 4 \times 4 \) gallons (since 16 gallons have leaked out in the last 4 minutes), and the amount of water in the big pool was \( B + 4 \times 4 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To find Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months, we need to calculate the total amount she owes initially, the total amount she will have paid after 12 months, and then subtract the latter from the former.

1. Calculate the total amount Janeth owes initially:
   - The principal amount is $2000.
   - The additional 10% interest on the principal is 10/100 * $2000 = $200.
   - Therefore, the total amount she owes is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

2. Calculate the total amount Janeth will have paid after 12 months:
   - She pays $165 a month for 12 months, so the total amount paid is $165 * 12 = $1980.

3. Calculate the remaining balance:
   - The remaining balance is the total amount owed minus the total amount paid, which is $2200 - $1980 = $220.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces, and then determine how long it will take them to place all 360 pieces.

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom's rate is half of Kalinda's, which is 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can place:
4 pieces/minute (Kalinda) + 2 pieces/minute (Mom) = 6 pieces/minute

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to place all 360 pieces at this combined rate:
360 pieces / 6 pieces/minute = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the time to hours:
60 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 1 hour

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"First, we need to calculate how many watermelons were ready for harvest when Ashlyn first visited the farm. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we can calculate this as:

120 watermelons * 30% = 120 * 0.30 = 36 watermelons

So, Ashlyn took 36 watermelons home during her first visit. This leaves us with:

120 watermelons - 36 watermelons = 84 watermelons

These 84 watermelons were not ready for harvest at the time of her first visit. When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. We can calculate the number of watermelons that were ready as:

84 watermelons * 3/4 = 63 watermelons

So, Ashlyn took an additional 63 watermelons home during her second visit. This leaves us with the remaining watermelons that were not ready for harvest:

84 watermelons - 63 watermelons = 21 watermelons

Therefore, after the two weeks, 21 watermelons were not ready to be harvested.

"To find out how much Mark pays for everything, we need to calculate the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

1. Cost of the cars: 12 cars * $20,000 per car
2. Tax on the cars: 10% of the total cost of the cars
3. Registration fees: $1,000 per car * 12 cars

Let's calculate each part:

1. Cost of the cars: 12 * $20,000 = $240,000
2. Tax on the cars: 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000
3. Registration fees: 12 * $1,000 = $12,000

Now, we add all these costs together to get the total amount Mark pays:

Total cost = Cost of the cars + Tax on the cars + Registration fees
Total cost = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000

Total cost = $276,000

"To find out how many penguins are still left sunbathing, we need to calculate the number of penguins that jumped in the ocean and the number that went inside the cave to eat their dinner, and then subtract these from the total number of penguins.

There are 36 penguins in total. One-third of them jump in and swim in the ocean, and another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner.

One-third of 36 penguins is:
36 / 3 = 12 penguins

Since two-thirds of the penguins (one-third for swimming and one-third for eating) are no longer sunbathing, we have:
2 * 12 = 24 penguins

Now, we subtract the 24 penguins from the total to find out how many are still sunbathing:
36 - 24 = 12 penguins

So, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:

"To determine how many vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate the total number of tomatoes he and his girlfriend will consume per week.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so in a week (7 days), he eats:
6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats:
42 tomatoes/week / 2 = 21 tomatoes/week

Together, they eat:
42 tomatoes/week (Steve) + 21 tomatoes/week (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week

Now, if a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week is:
63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine/week = 21 vines

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines to meet their weekly tomato consumption.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial pens Ram buys and the additional pens he can create by mixing the ink from the empty ones.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. So, from the 25 empty pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.
3. After using these 5 new pens, he will have 5 more empty pens, which he can again mix to make 1 more pen.
4. After using this 1 pen, he will have 1 more empty pen, but he won't have enough to make another pen since he needs 5 empty pens to make one new pen.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to use is the initial 25 pens plus the 5 new pens plus the 1 additional pen he made.

25 (initial pens) + 5 (first batch of new pens) + 1 (second batch of new pens) = 31 pens

"To find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we can start by determining the age of each girl based on the information provided.

Jessa's age is given as 20 years old.

Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan's age is:
20 years (Jessa's age) + 5 years = 25 years

Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is:
25 years (Joan's age) - 2 years = 23 years

Now, we can find the sum of their ages:
20 years (Jessa) + 25 years (Joan) + 23 years (Mary) = 68 years

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 68.

"To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Calculate the number of students remaining after exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C, which is the rest of the students.

Let's start with step 1:

1. 30% of the students went out through exit A.
   30% of 1000 students = 0.30 * 1000 = 300 students

Now, step 2:

2. The number of students remaining after exit A is:
   1000 students - 300 students = 700 students

Next, step 3:

3. 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B.
   3/5 of 700 students = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students

Finally, step 4:

4. The number of students who went out through exit C is the rest of the students:
   700 students - 420 students = 280 students

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.

2. John has twice as many candies as Robert, so Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.
3. James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

Now, to find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

54 (John's candies) - 33 (James's candies) = 21

So, John has 21 more candies than James.

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of pen pals Mike is still in contact with.
2. Calculate the total number of letters he receives each week.
3. Calculate the total number of pages he needs to write in response.
4. Determine the total time he spends writing those pages.
5. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Step 1: Mike was a pen pal with 5 people and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he is still in contact with:
5 - 2 = 3 people

Step 2: Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, so the total number of letters he receives each week is:
3 * 2 = 6 letters

Step 3: Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he needs to write in response is:
6 * 5 = 30 pages

Step 4: Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing is:
30 * 6 = 180 minutes

Step 5: To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
180 / 60 = 3 hours

So, Mike spends 3 hours writing letters each week.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries from Griffin, so Griffin has 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes 2 * 5 = 10 fries from Griffin. Now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.
4. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle took, so Colby takes 5 - 3 = 2 fries from Griffin. Now Griffin has 9 - 2 = 7 fries left.
5. Ginger gives Griffin some fries, and after that, Griffin has 27 fries.

To find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin, we need to calculate the difference between the number of fries Griffin had after Colby took some and the number of fries Griffin had at the end.

So, Ginger gave Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

"To find the number of fish in each aquarium, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( f \).

The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Since there are the same number of fish in each aquarium, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).

So we can write the equation as:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ f = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the number of cookies each of them ate and then convert that into calories.

First, let's calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on each day:

- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate \( 2 \times 13 = 26 \) cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate:

- Sue's total cookies: \( 20 + 26 = 46 \)
- Her sister's total cookies: \( 5 + 13 = 18 \)

Next, we convert the number of cookies into calories. Since 1 cookie has 200 calories:

- Sue's total calories: \( 46 \times 200 = 9200 \) calories
- Her sister's total calories: \( 18 \times 200 = 3600 \) calories

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.
2. Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars.
3. Today, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, which means he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Now, we can find out how many wolves Rick killed today. Since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and he killed 12 cougars, he killed 3 * 12 = 36 wolves today.

Now we can calculate the total number of animals Rick killed over the two nights:

- Wolves: 10 (last night) + 36 (today) = 46 wolves
- Cougars: 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27 cougars

Adding these together gives us the total number of animals killed:

30% of 30 = 0.30 * 30 = 9

Now, we subtract that from Mitchel's total to find Anne's total:
Anne's slides = Mitchel's slides - 30% of Mitchel's slides
Anne's slides = 30 - 9 = 21

Now that we know Anne went down the slide 21 times, we can calculate how many times Robert went down the slide, which is 4 times as much as Anne:
Robert's slides = 4 * Anne's slides
Robert's slides = 4 * 21 = 84

So, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

40 cows / 20 stalls = 2 cows/stall

Now, we add the 2 new cows to the original 20 cows in each stall:

20 cows/stall + 2 cows/stall = 22 cows/stall

Since we want to know how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by termites from the total weight to find the remaining weight.

Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree.
- The tree is 200 feet tall.
- Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.
- There are 200 / 10 = 20 sections in the tree.
- The total weight of the tree is 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds.

Step 2: Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
- The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood.
- The weight of the wood eaten is 30% of 8000 pounds = 0.30 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds.

Step 3: Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by termites from the total weight.

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
4. Andrea has 52 apples.

From point 1, we can write the equation for the number of apples Jamal has as:
A = J + 8
where A is the number of apples Andrea has and J is the number of apples Jamal has.

Since we know Andrea has 52 apples, we can substitute A with 52:
52 = J + 8
Solving for J, we get:
J = 52 - 8
J = 44
So, Jamal has 44 apples.

From point 3, we can write the equation for the number of bananas Jamal has as:
B = J + 4
where B is the number of bananas Jamal has.

Substituting J with 44, we get:
B = 44 + 4
B = 48
So, Jamal has 48 bananas.

From point 2, we can write the equation for the number of bananas Andrea has as:
A_b = B / 2
where A_b is the number of bananas Andrea has.

Substituting B with 48, we get:
A_b = 48 / 2
A_b = 24
So, Andrea has 24 bananas.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have:
Total fruits = A + J + A_b + B
Total fruits = 52 (Andrea's apples) + 44 (Jamal's apples) + 24 (Andrea's bananas) + 48 (Jamal's bananas)
Total fruits = 52 + 44 + 24 + 48

   Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $350,000
   Brokerage fee = $17,500

2. Calculate the transfer fee:
   Transfer fee = 12% of $350,000

1. Transfer fees: 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000
2. Brokerage fee: 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000
3. Total deductions: $12,000 (transfer fees) + $20,000 (brokerage fee) + $250,000 (remaining loan) = $282,000

Now, subtract the total deductions from the selling price to find the net proceeds:

Net proceeds = $400,000 (selling price) - $282,000 (total deductions) = $118,000

$118,000"
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up from 300 degrees to 400 degrees. It takes 40% longer than the initial 20 minutes it took to reach 300 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes is 0.40 * 20 = 8 minutes.

So, the time to heat up to 400 degrees is 20 minutes + 8 minutes = 28 minutes.

Now, let's add the initial 20 minutes to reach 300 degrees to the 28 minutes to reach 400 degrees:

20 minutes + 28 minutes = 48 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the cooking time, which is 5 minutes less than the time it took to warm up the oil to 400 degrees. The warming time was 48 minutes, so the cooking time is:

48 minutes - 5 minutes = 43 minutes.

Finally, we add the cooking time to the warming time to get the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:

48 minutes + 43 minutes = 91 minutes.

"To find out how much the real estate agent spent on buying all the ads, we need to calculate the total cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the newspaper ads is calculated as follows:
50 newspaper ads * $5 per newspaper ad = $250

The cost of the television ads is calculated as follows:
15 television ads * $75 per television ad = $1125

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total cost:
$250 (newspaper ads) + $1125 (television ads) = $1375

The real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads.

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary has, we need to add the number of M&Ms in each of the three bags.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, we add the M&Ms from all three bags together:
300 (first bag) + 312 (second bag) + 150 (third bag) = 762 M&Ms.

"To find the total number of windows in both houses, we can break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. Calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house:
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - There are 3 bedrooms in one house.
   - So, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is 3 bedrooms * 2 windows/bedroom = 6 windows.

2. Add the additional windows in one house that are not connected to bedrooms:
   - There are 4 additional windows in one house.
   - So, the total number of windows in one house is 6 windows (from bedrooms) + 4 windows (additional) = 10 windows.

3. Since John has 2 houses, we need to double the number of windows in one house to get the total number of windows in both houses:
   - Total number of windows in both houses is 2 houses * 10 windows/house = 20 windows.

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is 20.

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we can start by calculating the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette, and then subtracting these from the total number of stitches to find the number of stitches left for the two sleeves.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches the body of the sweater takes, so:
Collar stitches = 900 stitches / 10 = 90 stitches

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so:
Rosette stitches = 90 stitches * 2 = 180 stitches

The total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800, so we can subtract the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette to find the number of stitches for the two sleeves:
Sleeves stitches = 1800 stitches - (900 stitches + 90 stitches + 180 stitches)
Sleeves stitches = 1800 stitches - 1170 stitches
Sleeves stitches = 630 stitches

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the number of sleeve stitches by 2 to find the number of stitches per sleeve:
Stitches per sleeve = 630 stitches / 2 = 315 stitches

"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines in each part of his role and then sum them up.

1. The solo song has 54 lines, and all of them are his.
2. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 54 * 2 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are his, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.
3. The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are his, so he has to memorize 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, we add up all the lines he has to memorize:
- Lines from the song: 54
- Lines from the first scene: 36
- Lines from the second scene: 48

Total lines to memorize: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138

2. Calculate the number of remaining cards after the A cards are taken out.
3. Calculate the number of cards with the letter B from the remaining cards.
4. Calculate the number of remaining cards after the B cards are taken out.
5. Calculate the number of cards with the letter C from the remaining cards.
6. The rest of the cards will have the letter D.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Number of A cards: \( \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \)
2. Remaining cards after A: \( 80 - 32 = 48 \)
3. Number of B cards: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \)
4. Remaining cards after B: \( 48 - 24 = 24 \)
5. Number of C cards: \( \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \)
6. Remaining cards (D cards): \( 24 - 15 = 9 \)

So, the number of cards with the letter D on them is 9.

"To find out how many hours it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the total time for each type of hole and then convert the total time into hours.

First, we calculate the time for the small holes:
30 small holes * 3 minutes per small hole = 90 minutes

Next, we calculate the time for the large holes:
15 large holes * 10 minutes per large hole = 150 minutes

Now, we add the total time for both small and large holes:
90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

Finally, we convert the total minutes into hours:
240 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 4 hours

"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we can start with the sum of their current ages and then add 10 years for each of them.

The sum of their current ages is 20. In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older, so we add 10 years for Mico and 10 years for Marco, which is a total of 20 years added to their current combined age.

So, the calculation is:

Current sum of ages: 20
Years to add for both in 10 years: 10 + 10 = 20

Sum of their ages in 10 years: 20 + 20 = 40

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

According to the problem, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write the first equation as:
\[ R = 6S \]

In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write the second equation as:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now we can substitute the value of \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expanding the equation, we get:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To find half the number of spots all the snakes have combined, we first need to determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can set up the following equation:

Let the number of spots on a mamba be \( x \).
Then the number of spots on a cobra is \( 2x \).

We know that a cobra has 70 spots, so:
\( 2x = 70 \)
\( x = 70 / 2 \)
\( x = 35 \)

So, a mamba has 35 spots.

Now, we can calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park:

Total spots for cobras = Number of cobras * Spots per cobra
Total spots for cobras = 40 * 70
Total spots for cobras = 2800

Total spots for mambas = Number of mambas * Spots per mamba
Total spots for mambas = 60 * 35
Total spots for mambas = 2100

Total spots for all snakes = Total spots for cobras + Total spots for mambas
Total spots for all snakes = 2800 + 2100
Total spots for all snakes = 4900

Half the number of spots they all have combined is:
Half the total spots = Total spots for all snakes / 2
Half the total spots = 4900 / 2
Half the total spots = 2450

"To find out how many dollars Maddy will spend on pizza, we need to calculate the total number of people, the number of pizzas required, and then the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total number of people:
- There are 12 team members.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 guests.
- There are 3 coaches.

So, the total number of people is 12 (team members) + 24 (guests) + 3 (coaches) = 39 people.

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3:
- 39 people / 3 people per pizza = 13 pizzas.

Finally, we calculate the total cost:
- 13 pizzas * $15 per pizza = $195.

So, Maddy will spend $195 on pizza.

"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones and then determine how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 of them, so the total length of the topaz gemstones is:
8 gemstones * 1 inch/gemstone = 8 inches

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, so the length available for the sterling silver beads is:
25 inches (total length) - 8 inches (topaz gemstones) = 17 inches

Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, so the number of sterling silver beads that can fit into the 17 inches is:
17 inches / (1/4 inch/bead) = 17 * 4 beads = 68 beads

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. In the second week, they each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week.

So, in the second week:
- Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories
- Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories
- Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories

Now, let's add the stories from both weeks for each of them:
- Alani's total: 20 (first week) + 40 (second week) = 60 stories
- Braylen's total: 40 (first week) + 80 (second week) = 120 stories
- Margot's total: 60 (first week) + 120 (second week) = 180 stories

Finally, we add all their stories together to get the total number of stories written by the family:
60 (Alani) + 120 (Braylen) + 180 (Margot) = 360 stories

"To find out how many rows of 5 stars there are, we first need to calculate the total number of stars in the rows that are not 5-star rows.

There are three rows of 8 stars, which gives us:
3 rows * 8 stars/row = 24 stars

There are two rows of 6 stars, which gives us:
2 rows * 6 stars/row = 12 stars

Adding these together, we have:
24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars

The flag has a total of 76 stars, so the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:
76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars

To find out how many rows of 5 stars there are, we divide the number of 5-star row stars by 5:
40 stars / 5 stars/row = 8 rows

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

"To calculate the total cost John pays for the driving service in a year, we need to consider both the mileage cost and the monthly bonus.

First, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- John's work is 30 miles away, so a round trip is 60 miles.
- He goes to work 5 days a week, so in a week, he travels 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week.
- Over 50 weeks, he travels 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.
- At a rate of $2 per mile, the cost for the miles driven is 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000/year.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the monthly bonus:
- He gives a $150 bonus per month.
- There are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus for the year is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year.

Now, we add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to get the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of miles driven + total bonus
- Total cost = $30,000/year + $1,800/year = $31,800/year.

Therefore, John pays $31,800 a year for the driving service.

- Total number of books: 250
- Price per book: $20
- Number of unsold books: 50
- Number of books sold in the current (third) year: 45
- Number of books sold in the first year: twice the number sold in the current year

First, we calculate the number of books sold in the first year:
Number of books sold in the first year = 2 * number of books sold in the third year
Number of books sold in the first year = 2 * 45 = 90

Next, we calculate the total number of books sold over the three years:
Total books sold = Total number of books - Number of unsold books
Total books sold = 250 - 50 = 200

Now, we can find out how many books were sold in the second year by subtracting the number of books sold in the first and third years from the total number of books sold:
Number of books sold in the second year = Total books sold - (Number of books sold in the first year + Number of books sold in the third year)
Number of books sold in the second year = 200 - (90 + 45)
Number of books sold in the second year = 200 - 135
Number of books sold in the second year = 65

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:

- His total weekly earnings are $500 (hourly wage) + $300 (bonus) = $800.

April typically has 4 weeks, so we will calculate his earnings for 4 weeks:
- His total earnings for April are 4 * $800 = $3200.

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April.

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning:
   Two-thirds of 60 loaves are sold in the morning.
   \( \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \) loaves

2. Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales:
   \( 60 - 40 = 20 \) loaves

3. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon:
   Half of the remaining 20 loaves are sold in the afternoon.
   \( \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \) loaves

So, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week and then calculate how long it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight, given that it takes her 4 weeks to lose what Joey loses in one week.

First, we find out how much weight Joey loses in one week:
Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so in one week, Joey loses:
8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Now, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week, which is 2 pounds. To lose 8 pounds, Sandy will need:
8 pounds / 2 pounds per week = 4 weeks for each 2 pounds

Since it takes Sandy 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds, to lose 8 pounds (which is 4 times 2 pounds), it will take her:
4 weeks * 4 = 16 weeks

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

"To calculate the total savings, we need to determine the savings on the ice cream and the milk separately and then add them together.

For the ice cream:
- Original price per tub: $13
- Discounted price per tub: $11
- Savings per tub: $13 - $11 = $2
- Total savings for 2 tubs: 2 * $2 = $4

For the milk:
- Discount per packet: $0.5
- Total savings for 4 packets: 4 * $0.5 = $2

Total savings for both items:
- Total savings: $4 (ice cream) + $2 (milk) = $6

"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after drinking Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum for fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of new arms and legs separately and then add them together.

An extra arm grows every 3 days, so in 15 days, the number of new arms is:
15 days / 3 days/arm = 5 new arms

An extra leg grows every 5 days, so in 15 days, the number of new legs is:
15 days / 5 days/leg = 3 new legs

Adding the new arms and legs together gives us the total number of new limbs:
5 new arms + 3 new legs = 8 new limbs

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 suits * $100/suit = $600

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150

$700 + (5 * $100) = $700 + $500 = $1200

The total amount spent on suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket is:
$600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the amount he has left to spend on gifts after buying the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket, and setting aside the savings is:
$6000 - $1950 - $2000 = $2050

So, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

"To calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to first determine the daily egg consumption and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

There are three people who eat three eggs each day, and two people who eat two eggs each day.

The three people will consume:
3 people * 3 eggs/person/day = 9 eggs/day

The two people will consume:
2 people * 2 eggs/person/day = 4 eggs/day

The total daily consumption is:
9 eggs/day + 4 eggs/day = 13 eggs/day

Now, to find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
13 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 91 eggs/week

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Cera is currently 46 years old.
2. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
3. Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
4. Currently, Noah is 20 + 6 = 26 years old.
5. Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times the age of Noah, so the population was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.
6. Six years ago, the population of Chile was half what it is now, so the current population is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

The population of Chile now is 120,000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \). According to the problem, there are twice as many players on the offense, which we can denote as \( 2D \), and half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, which we can denote as \( \frac{1}{2}D \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]

To combine the terms, we need a common denominator, which is 2:

\[ \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{1D}{2} = 105 \]

\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 and then divide by 7:

\[ 7D = 210 \]

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

   - 3 families with 4 people: 3 * 4 = 12 people
   - Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24 people

2. Subtract the number of people who couldn't come due to illness:
   - 8 people couldn't come due to illness
   - Total people after illness: 24 - 8 = 16 people

3. Subtract the number of people who had previous commitments:
   - 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments: 8 * 1/4 = 2 people
   - Total people after previous commitments: 16 - 2 = 14 people

So, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is 14.

"First, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has.

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
2. He already had 50 marbles in the store.
3. His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, let's add all the marbles together:

20 (from Johanna) + 50 (already in store) + 8 (from his father) = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of the marbles is:

78 marbles * 2kgs/marble = 156kgs.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular pool is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length \( l = 6 \) feet
- Width \( w = 4 \) feet
- Depth \( d = 5 \) feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 \]

\[ V = 24 \times 5 \]

\[ V = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $0.1 per cubic foot, so the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]

\[ C = 120 \times 0.1 \]

\[ C = 12 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $12.

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls and nongendered children based on the number of boys, and then add all the numbers together.

Given:
- The classroom has 30 boys.
- There are 3 times as many girls as boys.
- There are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys.

Let's calculate the number of girls:
Number of girls = 3 * Number of boys
Number of girls = 3 * 30
Number of girls = 90

Now, let's calculate the number of nongendered children:
Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * Number of boys
Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * 30
Number of nongendered children = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children
Total number of children = 30 + 90 + 3
Total number of children = 123

"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left, which means 1/4 of 40 people left the party. That's 40 / 4 = 10 people who left.

If 22 men stayed at the party, that means 25 (initial number of men) - 22 (men who stayed) = 3 men left the party.

Since 10 people left in total and 3 of them were men, the remaining 10 - 3 = 7 people who left must have been women.

Initially, there were 15 women, so the number of women left at the party is 15 (initial number of women) - 7 (women who left) = 8 women.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has a total of 26 pencils, 2 of which are loose, so the pencils in the boxes total 26 - 2 = 24 pencils. Since these 24 pencils are evenly distributed among 3 boxes, each box contains 24 / 3 = 8 pencils.

Now, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store all of Jam's and Meg's pencils. Jam has 26 pencils and Meg has 46 pencils, so together they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold to find out how many boxes are needed: 72 / 8 = 9 boxes.

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To find out how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to calculate the total amount of liquid added to the coffee, which includes both the ice cubes and the cream.

First, we need to determine how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can find the number of ice cubes by dividing the total cooling needed by the cooling effect of one ice cube:

Number of ice cubes = Total cooling needed / Cooling per ice cube
Number of ice cubes = 65 degrees / 13 degrees per ice cube
Number of ice cubes = 5

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so the total weakening from the ice cubes is:

Weakening from ice cubes = Number of ice cubes * Weakening per ice cube
Weakening from ice cubes = 5 * 12 milliliters
Weakening from ice cubes = 60 milliliters

Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which further weakens the coffee. So, the total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:

Total weakening = Weakening from ice cubes + Weakening from cream
Total weakening = 60 milliliters + 15 milliliters
Total weakening = 75 milliliters

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of junior programmers.
2. Calculate the number of senior programmers.
3. Calculate the monthly pay for a senior programmer.
4. Calculate the total monthly pay for all junior programmers.
5. Calculate the total monthly pay for all senior programmers.
6. Add the total monthly pay for junior and senior programmers to get the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.

Let's start with step 1:

1. The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees. Since the company has 100 employees, the number of junior programmers is:
   \( \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \)

2. The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers:
   \( \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \)

3. The monthly pay for a senior programmer is $400 more than a junior programmer, who is paid $2000 per month:
   \( \text{Monthly pay for a senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \)

4. The total monthly pay for all junior programmers is:
   \( \text{Total pay for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \)

5. The total monthly pay for all senior programmers is:
   \( \text{Total pay for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \)

6. The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the number of people on the bus is now \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got in, so the number of people on the bus is now \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

We know that after the second stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus heading to the third stop. So we can set up the following equation:

\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = 20 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 5 - 7 + 8 = 20 \]
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal.

"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to determine the remaining percentage of charge needed:

100% - 60% = 40%

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. To find out how many minutes it will take to charge 40 percentage-points, we multiply the number of percentage-points by the time it takes to charge one percentage-point:

40 percentage-points * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes

Now, to convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

Rewards earned = $80 / $20 = 4 rewards

Each reward is worth $1, so the customer has $4 off to use on their next purchase.

On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43 before any discounts. They used their $4 in rewards, and the coupon they applied took twice the amount of the rewards off the price.

Coupon discount = 2 * $4 = $8

Now, let's calculate the total discount applied to the $43 purchase:

Total discount = Rewards + Coupon discount
Total discount = $4 + $8 = $12

Finally, we subtract the total discount from the original purchase amount to find out how much the customer paid:

Amount paid = Original purchase amount - Total discount
Amount paid = $43 - $12 = $31

The customer paid $31 on this shopping trip.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chickens and cows Farmer Brown has, and then calculate the total number of legs.

Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( Ch \).

According to the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of animals is 60, so \( C + Ch = 60 \).
2. There are twice as many chickens as cows, so \( Ch = 2C \).

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( C \):
\( C + 2C = 60 \)
\( 3C = 60 \)
\( C = 20 \)

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\( Ch = 2C \)
\( Ch = 2 \times 20 \)
\( Ch = 40 \)

Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. So, the total number of legs is:

"Juice Box A costs 4 dollars. 

Juice Box B costs 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it costs 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.

Juice Box C costs 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it costs 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C: 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

"To calculate the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have, we need to multiply the number of tables by the number of legs for each type of table and then add the two results together.

For the 40 tables with 4 legs each:
40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs

For the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs

Now, we add the two totals together:
160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband, and then subtract that from the total number of cookies in the bag.

Jenny's son gets 4 cookies a day for 5 days a week, so he eats:
4 cookies/day * 5 days/week = 20 cookies/week

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days a week, so he eats:
1 cookie/day * 7 days/week = 7 cookies/week

Together, they eat:
20 cookies/week (son) + 7 cookies/week (husband) = 27 cookies/week

The bag has 36 cookies, so the number of cookies Jenny eats is:
36 cookies - 27 cookies = 9 cookies

Jenny eats 9 cookies.

2. Calculate the discount amount.
3. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to get the final price.

Step 1: Total cost without discount
2 shirts * $30 each = $60

Step 2: Discount amount
40% of $60 = 0.40 * $60 = $24

Step 3: Final price
$60 - $24 = $36

Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

"To find out what percentage more the factory is making per day now, we need to calculate the daily revenue from both tractors and silos, and then compare the two.

First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractors:
10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silos:
5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

Now, we find the difference in daily revenue:
$1100/day - $1000/day = $100/day

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original daily revenue from tractors and multiply by 100:
($100/day / $1000/day) * 100 = 10%

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

"To calculate the total amount of money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to add up the monthly costs and then multiply by 12 (the number of months in a year).

First, let's calculate the monthly cost of food:
- Food costs $25 per week.
- There are 4 weeks in a month.
- So, the monthly cost of food is $25 * 4 = $100.

Next, we have the cost of treats, which is $20 per month.

Then, the cost of medicine is $100 per month.

Now, let's add up the monthly costs:
- Monthly cost of food: $100
- Monthly cost of treats: $20
- Monthly cost of medicine: $100
- Total monthly cost: $100 + $20 + $100 = $220

Finally, to find the yearly cost, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12:
- Yearly cost: $220 * 12 = $2640

So, Madeline spends $2640 on her dog per year.

"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots she donates and then subtract that from the number of plant pots she originally bought.

The school asked for 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses. This means they asked for:
- 30 plant pots for the daisies
- 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses

The total number of plant pots the school asked for is:
30 (daisies) + 60 (roses) = 90 plant pots

April had already bought 100 plant pots. After donating the 90 plant pots, she will have:
100 - 90 = 10 plant pots left over

"To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to first determine the total time he spent on vacation. We know that the time he spent watching shows (3 shows * 2 hours each) and the time he spent boating and swimming is 30% of his total vacation time.

Let's calculate the time spent on these activities:
- Boating: 6 hours
- Swimming: 6 / 2 = 3 hours
- Watching shows: 3 * 2 = 6 hours

Total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows:
6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (shows) = 15 hours

This 15 hours is 30% of his total vacation time. We can set up the equation to find the total vacation time (T):
15 hours = 0.30 * T

Now we solve for T:
T = 15 hours / 0.30
T = 50 hours

Now that we know the total vacation time, we can calculate the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time:
Time spent sightseeing = 0.40 * T
Time spent sightseeing = 0.40 * 50 hours
Time spent sightseeing = 20 hours

So, John spent 20 hours sightseeing.

"To find out how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and add that to her current savings. Then we subtract that total from the cost of the phone.

First, we calculate her earnings from the first job:
$10 per hour * 20 hours = $200

Next, we calculate her earnings from the second job:
$5 per hour * 15 hours = $75

Now, we add her earnings from both jobs to her current savings:
$200 (first job) + $75 (second job) + $80 (current savings) = $355

Finally, we subtract her total savings from the cost of the phone to find out how much more she needs:
$400 (cost of the phone) - $355 (total savings) = $45

So, Annabelle still needs to save $45.

"To find the height of the tallest tree, we first need to determine the heights of the other two trees.

The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.

The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so its height is:
6 feet + 5 feet = 11 feet

The combined height of the shortest and the second tree is:
6 feet + 11 feet = 17 feet

The tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree, so its height is:
17 feet * 2 = 34 feet

The height of the tallest tree is 34 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars and teddy bears that Dean bought.

The cost of 6 toy cars at $2 each is:
6 * $2 = $12

The cost of 5 teddy bears at $1 each is:
5 * $1 = $5

The total cost of the toys is:
$12 + $5 = $17

Dean initially had $28 and spent $17, so he has:
$28 - $17 = $11

After that, Dean's mother gives him an extra $10, so he now has:
$11 + $10 = $21

Therefore, Dean has $21 left.

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for one person (Morgan) to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then we can see how many people can be accommodated within the $90 budget.

The cost for one person is:
- Mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- Go-karts (2 rides): $10 * 2 = $20

Total cost for one person: $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Now, we need to see how many people can be accommodated with the $90 budget. Since Morgan is also part of the group, we need to include her in the count.

$90 / $30 = 3

This means that the budget can cover the cost for 3 people, which includes Morgan and 2 friends.

The number of friends Morgan can invite is 2.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Billy starts with $10.
2. He buys candy at $1.5 per pound.
3. After buying the candy, he has some change left.
4. He spends half of his change on gumballs, which cost $0.05 each.
5. He bought 40 gumballs.

First, we need to find out how much money Billy spent on the gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05 and he bought 40, the total cost for the gumballs is:

40 gumballs * $0.05/gumball = $2.00

Since this $2.00 is half of his change, his total change after buying the candy must have been:

$2.00 * 2 = $4.00

Now we know that Billy had $4.00 left after buying the candy. This means he spent:

$10.00 - $4.00 = $6.00 on candy.

To find out how many pounds of candy he bought, we divide the amount he spent on candy by the cost per pound:

$6.00 / $1.5/pound = 4 pounds

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \). According to the problem, Carver is 5 years less than twice his son's age. We can write this as an equation:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 2x = 45 + 5 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the train travels in one complete trip between the three cities, then multiply that by the number of trips it makes in a day, and finally determine how many days it can operate before reaching the 18,000-mile service interval.

1. Calculate the distance from the third city to the first city:
   The combined distance from the first to the second and then to the third city is 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles.
   The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than 175 miles, which is 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.

2. Calculate the total distance for one complete trip:
   The total distance for one trip is the sum of the distances between all three cities: 75 miles + 100 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.

3. Calculate the total distance traveled in one day:
   Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is 300 miles * 3 = 900 miles.

4. Calculate the number of days before service is needed:
   The train needs service every 18,000 miles, so we divide 18,000 miles by the daily distance to find out how many days it can go without service: 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.

The train goes 20 days between services.

"To find out how many pounds of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to determine the amount of stuffing required for a collie bed. Since a collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed, we can calculate it as follows:

Average stuffing for a collie bed = (Stuffing for a Rottweiler bed + Stuffing for a chihuahua bed) / 2
Average stuffing for a collie bed = (8 pounds + 2 pounds) / 2
Average stuffing for a collie bed = 10 pounds / 2
Average stuffing for a collie bed = 5 pounds

Now we can calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds:

Total stuffing for chihuahua beds = 4 beds * 2 pounds/bed
Total stuffing for chihuahua beds = 8 pounds

Total stuffing for collie beds = 3 beds * 5 pounds/bed
Total stuffing for collie beds = 15 pounds

Total stuffing needed = Total stuffing for chihuahua beds + Total stuffing for collie beds
Total stuffing needed = 8 pounds + 15 pounds
Total stuffing needed = 23 pounds

"To calculate the total time John spent on his trip, we need to calculate the time for each leg of the journey and then add them together.

1. For the trip to his friend's house:
   - The original distance is 200 miles, but he had to take a detour that added 10 miles, making the total distance 210 miles.
   - He drives at a speed of 70 mph.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

2. For the trip back home:
   - The distance is 240 miles.
   - He drives at a speed of 80 mph.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

Now, we add the time for both trips to get the total time:
Total time = Time to friend's house + Time back home = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks be \( x \).
2. According to the problem, \( x = 3 \) (since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks).
3. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4x - 5 \).
4. The number of people kicked out for physical violence is \( 3 \) times the number of shoplifters, which is \( 3(4x - 5) \).
5. The total number of people kicked out is the sum of those kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, physical violence, and other reasons, which is \( 50 \).

Let's denote the number of people kicked out for other reasons as \( y \).

The equation representing the total number of people kicked out is:

\[ x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) + y = 50 \]

Now we can substitute \( x = 3 \) into the equation:

\[ 3 + (4 \cdot 3 - 5) + 3(4 \cdot 3 - 5) + y = 50 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3 + (12 - 5) + 3(12 - 5) + y = 50 \]
\[ 3 + 7 + 3 \cdot 7 + y = 50 \]
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 + y = 50 \]
\[ 31 + y = 50 \]

Now, solve for \( y \):

\[ y = 50 - 31 \]
\[ y = 19 \]

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is \( 19 \).

The equation based on the given information is:

E + 14 = 3 * 8

Now we can solve for E:

E + 14 = 24
E = 24 - 14

3. **Pins cost**: 2 seniors * $5/pin = $10
4. **Cords cost**: 1/4 of 44 seniors are officers, so 44 / 4 = 11 officers, and 11 * $12/cord = $132

Now, we add all the costs together:

$880 (frames) + $176 (etching) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198

The total amount spent on the senior gifts is $1198.

"To find out how many apples Lucy picked over the three days, we need to determine the number of apples she picked each day and then sum them up.

First, we know that Lucy sold all the apples she picked on Monday for $56. Since she sells apples at $4 each, we can calculate the number of apples she sold on Monday by dividing the total amount of money by the price per apple:

Number of apples sold on Monday = Total money from Monday / Price per apple
Number of apples sold on Monday = $56 / $4
Number of apples sold on Monday = 14

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, so:

Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 2 * Number of apples picked on Tuesday
Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 2 * 12
Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 24

Now, we can sum up the number of apples picked over the three days:

Total number of apples picked = Number of apples picked on Monday + Number of apples picked on Tuesday + Number of apples picked on Wednesday
Total number of apples picked = 14 + 12 + 24
Total number of apples picked = 50

"To calculate the monthly payment Karan has to make, we need to determine the total amount she will owe after the five months, including the interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, we calculate the interest for the five months. The annual interest rate is 10%, so the monthly interest rate is 10% divided by 12 months, which is 0.8333% per month.

The formula to calculate the total interest for a simple interest loan is:

\[ \text{Total Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Where:
- Principal is the amount borrowed ($3,650),
- Rate is the monthly interest rate (0.8333% or 0.008333 as a decimal),
- Time is the duration in months (5 months).

Let's calculate the total interest:

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 3650 \times 0.008333 \times 5 \]

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 3650 \times 0.041665 \]

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 152.49425 \]

Now, we add the total interest to the principal to get the total amount to be repaid:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Total Interest} \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.49425 \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.49425 \]

Finally, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.49425}{5} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.49885 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.50 \]

1. Millie can make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, the total number of cups is:
   3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

2. She sells each cup for $1, so the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is:
   36 cups * $1/cup = $36

3. The cost of the supplies is $18, so the total profit is:
   $36 (total revenue) - $18 (cost of supplies) = $18

4. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find out how many hours it takes to sell all 36 cups, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour:
   36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours

5. Finally, to find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours:
   $18 (total profit) / 9 hours = $2/hour

So, Millie will make a profit of $2 per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand.

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up the following equation based on the information given:

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first. He sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, so he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. According to the problem, the amount of land left is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write:

\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To find \( x \), we can solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]

\[ x = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

On the day of the performance, only the female members are performing, and half of them can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, the number of girls who can make it to the performance is:

Number of girls performing = 26 / 2 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers also decide to sing with them, so we add them to the number of girls performing:

Total number of people performing = Number of girls performing + Number of teachers
Total number of people performing = 13 + 3 = 16

Therefore, the number of people who sang in the performance is:

"To determine how much money David saves by buying a ride bracelet instead of individual ride tickets, we need to calculate the total cost for both David and Dasha.

First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha, who buys individual ride tickets:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets.
- Each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs 2 * $2 = $4.
- For 9 rides, Dasha will pay 9 * $4 = $36.

Now, let's calculate the cost for David, who buys a ride bracelet:
- The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives access to all 9 rides.

To find out how much David saves, we subtract the cost of the ride bracelet from the cost of buying individual tickets for 9 rides:
- Savings = Cost of 9 individual tickets - Cost of the ride bracelet
- Savings = $36 - $30
- Savings = $6

David saves $6.

"To solve this problem, we can set up the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have as 5x and 6x, where x is a common multiplier. The total number of popsicles is the sum of the popsicles that Betty and Sam have, which is 5x + 6x = 11x. We know that 11x = 165, so we can solve for x:

11x = 165
x = 165 / 11
x = 15

Now that we have the value of x, we can find out how many popsicles each person has:

Betty has 5x = 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6x = 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number Sam has:

90 - 75 = 15

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To calculate the savings, we need to determine the total cost of the streaming services and then subtract that from the cost of the cable package.

First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu and Disney Plus each cost $10 a month, but with a 20% discount for bundling.

The discount on Hulu and Disney Plus is 20% of $20 (since each is $10 and he has both), which is $4. So, the bundled cost for Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

Now, let's add the cost of Netflix to the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:

$10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

The total cost of the cable package is $60 a month. So, the savings by cancelling the cable package and switching to streaming services is:

$60 (cable) - $26 (streaming services) = $34.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the time spent recording the song, which is half the time spent writing it.
2. Convert all times to the same unit (minutes in this case).
3. Calculate the total work time.
4. Calculate the percentage of the total work time spent editing.

Step 1: Time spent recording the song
- Writing time: 4 hours
- Recording time: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours

Step 2: Convert all times to minutes
- Writing time: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes
- Recording time: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
- Editing time: 90 minutes (already in minutes)

Step 3: Calculate the total work time
- Total work time = Writing time + Recording time + Editing time
- Total work time = 240 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes
- Total work time = 450 minutes

Step 4: Calculate the percentage of the total work time spent editing
- Percentage spent editing = (Editing time / Total work time) * 100
- Percentage spent editing = (90 / 450) * 100
- Percentage spent editing = 0.2 * 100
- Percentage spent editing = 20%

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many books Wendy will need, we first need to determine the number of books that can be placed in the shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns. The total number of books that can be placed is the product of the number of rows and the number of columns:

6 rows * 6 columns = 36 books

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double this number. So we first double the number of books:

2 * 36 books = 72 books

Then we add 20 more books to this number:

72 books + 20 books = 92 books

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to add the cards she initially made, the cards her dad brought, and the cards she received, then subtract the cards she passed out.

Erica made 20 cards.
Her dad brought 2 boxes of 15 cards each, so that's 2 * 15 = 30 cards.
She received 17 cards from family and friends.

So, the total number of cards Erica has is:
20 (made) + 30 (dad's) + 17 (received) = 67 cards.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, which is a total of:
24 + 5 = 29 cards.

Subtracting the cards she passed out from the total number of cards she has:
67 - 29 = 38 cards.

Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

First, we calculate the total amount of flour and milk needed for the quadruple batch:

- Flour: 3 cups per batch * 4 batches = 12 cups
- Milk: 1 cup per batch * 4 batches = 4 cups

Next, we determine how many 2-cup bags of flour and 2-cup bottles of milk Mark needs to buy:

- Flour: 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags
- Milk: 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles

Finally, we calculate how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy:

"To find out how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy usage of the air conditioner before the reduction.
2. Calculate the daily energy usage of the air conditioner after the reduction.
3. Find the difference in daily energy usage to determine the daily savings.
4. Multiply the daily savings by 30 to find the total savings over 30 days.

Step 1: Daily energy usage before reduction
The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. For 8 hours, the usage is:
900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours

Step 2: Daily energy usage after reduction
If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, he will use the air conditioner for 3 hours a day:
900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours

Step 3: Daily savings
The difference in energy usage is the amount saved each day:
7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours

Step 4: Total savings over 30 days
To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000 (since 1 kilowatt-hour = 1000 watt-hours):
4500 watt-hours/day * 30 days = 135000 watt-hours
135000 watt-hours / 1000 = 135 kilowatt-hours

So, Mel will save 135 kilowatt-hours of electric energy in 30 days.

"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we need to add up the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

First, we calculate the total number of stripes:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: 2 * 17 = 34 stripes
- One zebra with 36 stripes: 36 stripes
- One zebra with half as many stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: 36 / 2 = 18 stripes

Now, we add up all the stripes:
34 (from the two zebras) + 36 (from the one zebra) + 18 (from the last zebra) = 88 stripes

Next, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras to find the average:
88 stripes / 4 zebras = 22 stripes per zebra

The average number of stripes on the zebras is 22.

"To find out how much Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required and then multiply by their respective costs.

First, we determine how many sandwiches are needed to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people served per sandwich:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches, Tyson will need:

5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Now we calculate the cost for the meat and cheese:

5 pounds of meat * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
5 pounds of cheese * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

Finally, we add the cost of the meat and cheese together to get the total cost:

$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

So, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is:

40 + 60 = 100 cannolis

Now, Allan has 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so the new number of corns is:

100 - 40 = 60 corns

Finally, to find the combined total of corns and cannolis, we add the two quantities together:

100 cannolis + 60 corns = 160

"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 5,000 steps. He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, before his jog, he had completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. This means that before his jog, he had 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps completed or in progress.

Therefore, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is the difference between the steps he had before his jog and the steps he had after his walk with his friend, which is 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees who continued working in June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Add the total payments for May and June to get the final amount.

Step 1: Total payment for May
- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hours per week: 40
- Pay rate: $15 per hour
- Weeks in May: 4 (assuming a standard 4-week month)

Total payment for May = Number of employees * Hours per week * Pay rate * Weeks in May
Total payment for May = 40 * 40 * $15 * 4

Step 2: Number of employees in June
- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees continued working.
- Number of employees in June = 3/4 * Number of employees in May
- Number of employees in June = 3/4 * 40

Step 3: Total payment for June
- We will use the same hours per week and pay rate for June.
- Weeks in June: 4 (assuming a standard 4-week month)

Total payment for June = Number of employees in June * Hours per week * Pay rate * Weeks in June
Total payment for June = (3/4 * 40) * 40 * $15 * 4

Step 4: Total payment for May and June
Total payment for May and June = Total payment for May + Total payment for June

Now, let's calculate the numbers:

Total payment for May = 40 * 40 * $15 * 4 = 40 * 40 * 60 = 96,000

Number of employees in June = 3/4 * 40 = 30

Total payment for June = 30 * 40 * $15 * 4 = 30 * 40 * 60 = 72,000

Total payment for May and June = 96,000 + 72,000 = 168,000

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and then subtract that from the $10 her parents gave her.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means the first pound costs $3 and the second pound costs $3 * 1/2 = $1.50. So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, the mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

Then, the 4 magnets cost $0.25 each, so the total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
Total cost = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells + Cost of magnets
Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00
Total cost = $7.00

Finally, we subtract the total cost from the $10 Sally had:
Money left = $10 - Total cost
Money left = $10 - $7.00
Money left = $3.00

So, Sally has $3.00 left.

"To find out how much Tim spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks after the discount and then add the cost of the finale firework.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the two packages of fireworks before the discount:
- The first package costs $400.
- The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it costs $400 * 2 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages before the discount is:
$400 + $800 = $1200.

Now, let's apply the 20% discount to the two packages:
- A 20% discount means he pays 80% of the total cost.
- The discounted cost of the two packages is $1200 * 0.80 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the two packages:
$960 + $150 = $1110.

So, the total amount Tim spent is:
$1110.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog.

First, we need to find out how many candles are expected to explode. Since Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, 1% of them are expected to explode. 

1% of 50,000 candles is:
0.01 * 50,000 = 500 candles

Next, we need to find out how many of these exploding candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. We know that 5% of the more dangerous candles (the ones that explode) have this defect.

5% of 500 candles is:
0.05 * 500 = 25 candles

So, 25 candles are expected to both explode and smell like wet dog.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the discount amount and then apply it to the regular price of the blouses.

The regular price for each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount on the rack. To find the discount amount for one blouse, we calculate 30% of $20:

Discount per blouse = 30% of $20
                    = 0.30 * $20
                    = $6

Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to find the discounted price for one blouse:

Discounted price per blouse = Regular price - Discount
                            = $20 - $6
                            = $14

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so we multiply the discounted price of one blouse by 4 to find the total cost:

Total cost = Discounted price per blouse * Number of blouses
           = $14 * 4
           = $56

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Joanne gathers an unknown number of apples from the average trees, let's call this number \( x \).
4. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
5. Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
6. Joanne's sister gathers no apples from the average trees.
7. The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500.

We can set up the equation to represent the total number of apples gathered:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]
\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

Let \( c \) represent the number of camels and \( d \) represent the number of dromedaries.

From the information given, we have two equations:

1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 180:
   \( c + d = 180 \)

2. The total number of humps is 304, with camels having 2 humps and dromedaries having 1 hump:
   \( 2c + d = 304 \)

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of \( c \) and \( d \).

First, we can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( d \):

\( (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \)
\( 2c + d - c - d = 124 \)
\( c = 124 \)

Now that we know there are 124 camels, we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:

\( 124 + d = 180 \)
\( d = 180 - 124 \)
\( d = 56 \)

So, there are 56 dromedaries.

3. On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance for that day is:
   0 km

4. During the second week (7 days), he made 300 kilometers every day:
   7 days * 300 km/day = 2100 km

Now, we add up all the distances:
800 km (first 4 days) + 240 km (next 2 days) + 0 km (rest day) + 2100 km (second week) = 3140 km

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:

"To find out how big Timothy's locker is, we can start by determining the size of Zack's locker since we know the size of Peter's locker and the relationship between Zack's and Peter's lockers.

Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. So, to find the size of Zack's locker, we multiply Peter's locker size by 4:

Zack's locker size = Peter's locker size * 4
Zack's locker size = 5 cubic inches * 4
Zack's locker size = 20 cubic inches

Now, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. So, to find the size of Timothy's locker, we multiply Zack's locker size by 2:

Timothy's locker size = Zack's locker size * 2
Timothy's locker size = 20 cubic inches * 2
Timothy's locker size = 40 cubic inches

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to determine the elevation of the ledge where the comb landed and then calculate the difference between that elevation and Oliver's current elevation.

Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet. So, the elevation of the ledge where the comb landed is:

10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To reach the comb, Oliver must climb to the 6,000 feet elevation. The number of feet Oliver must climb is:

6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet

"To find out how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the amounts he received from the two banks to his initial capital.

The first bank gave him $4000.
The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.
He initially had $5000 in capital.

So, the total capital he has now is the sum of the initial capital and the amounts from both banks:
$5000 (initial capital) + $4000 (first bank) + $8000 (second bank) = $17000.

"To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of cats on the rock.
2. Subtract the number of cats carried away by the four boats.
3. Calculate the number of cats that ran after the mouse.
4. Subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats to find the final number of cats left on the rock.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Initial number of cats: 50
2. Number of cats carried away by the four boats: 4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats
3. Remaining cats after the boats left: 50 - 20 = 30 cats
4. Number of cats that ran after the mouse: 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats
5. Final number of cats left on the rock: 30 - 18 = 12 cats

"To calculate the total cost of the streaming service for 2 years, we need to break down the costs into the different periods and then sum them up.

1. The first 6 months at the special introductory deal: 6 months * $8/month = $48
2. The next 8 months at the normal price: 8 months * $12/month = $96
3. The remaining time in the 2-year period (24 months - 6 months - 8 months = 10 months) at the increased price: 10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, we add up all the costs to get the total for 2 years:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The tattered jeans cost $28.
2. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so they cost $28 - $6 = $22.
3. Cole saved a total of $6.
4. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, which is 1/3 * $6 = $2.
5. The rest of the savings, which is 2/3 of the total savings, came from the tattered jeans, so that's 2/3 * $6 = $4.

Now, to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we need to add the savings to the sale prices of the jeans to get their original prices.

6. The original price of the tattered jeans is $28 (sale price) + $4 (savings) = $32.
7. The original price of the jogger jeans is $22 (sale price) + $2 (savings) = $24.

Finally, to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we subtract the original price of the tattered jeans from the original price of the jogger jeans.

8. $24 (original price of jogger jeans) - $32 (original price of tattered jeans) = -$8.

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost, which implies a positive difference. Since we have a negative number, it means the tattered jeans originally cost more than the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans actually cost $8 less than the tattered jeans originally, not more. Therefore, the answer to the question as stated is 0, because the jogger jeans did not originally cost more than the tattered jeans.

"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles rented for the trip. We do this by multiplying the number of each type of vehicle by its capacity and then summing up the results.

For the buses:
4 buses * 60 employees/bus = 240 employees

For the minibusses:
6 minibusses * 30 employees/minibus = 180 employees

For the minivans:
10 minivans * 15 employees/minivan = 150 employees

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles:
240 employees (buses) + 180 employees (minibusses) + 150 employees (minivans) = 570 employees

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570.

3 homemade feeders * 30 birds per feeder = 90 birds

The total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is:
3 store-bought feeders * 20 birds per feeder = 60 birds

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is:
90 birds (from homemade feeders) + 60 birds (from store-bought feeders) = 150 birds

"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the bagel is given as $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup, we calculate 25% of $4 and add it to the original price of the bagel:
   25% of $4 = 0.25 * $4 = $1
   So, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.
3. The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is:
   0.5 * $4 = $2

Now, we add up the cost of all the items:
$4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to determine how many cards he sold and then calculate the total number of cards, including the ones he kept.

First, we know that Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 in spending cash, so he has a total of $150 from selling the cards.

The price per card is $1.5, so we can calculate the number of cards he sold by dividing the total amount of money by the price per card:

Number of cards sold = Total money / Price per card
Number of cards sold = $150 / $1.5
Number of cards sold = 100

Since Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, the 100 cards he sold represent the remaining 2/3 of his collection. We can set up the following equation to find the total number of cards (C) he started with:

2/3 * C = 100

To find C, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2:

C = 100 * (3/2)
C = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The caterer was initially told to prepare for 36 guests.
2. The caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. This means 18 guests (half of 36) would have two hotdogs, and the other 18 guests would have one hotdog.
3. The total number of hotdogs prepared is therefore 18 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest + 18 guests * 1 hotdog/guest = 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.
4. However, 40 guests showed up, and all of them wanted a second hotdog. This means 40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs would be needed.
5. Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs short is 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.
6. Since each guest who did not get a second hotdog is missing one hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is equal to the number of hotdogs short, which is 26.

"To find the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names, we first need to calculate the number of letters in her sister's name.

Indras has 6 letters in her name. Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than this, so her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we add the number of letters in both names to get the total:
6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13 letters.

"To find out how much Charlotte's order was after the 20% discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.
2. Calculate the discount amount.
3. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to get the final price.

Let's do the math:

1. The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
2. The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
3. The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

The discount is 20% of $165.00, which is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

The final price after the discount is $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

So, Charlotte's order was $132.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many gallons of gas are in one container.
2. Calculate how many gallons 1/4 of a container is.
3. Convert the gallons to pints, knowing that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints.

Step 1: Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5 to find out how many gallons are in one container.
15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Step 2: Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so we calculate 1/4 of 3 gallons.
3 gallons * 1/4 = 0.75 gallons

Step 3: Convert 0.75 gallons to pints.
0.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, which means he had 1% of $5 left, or $0.05.
2. This means he actually spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95 on chips and candy bars.
3. He bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each, so he spent 3 * $0.40 = $1.20 on chips.
4. The remaining amount he spent on candy bars is $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75.
5. Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is $3.75 / $0.75 = 5.

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide that by the number of servings.

First, let's calculate the cost of the onions:
- Antoine doubles the amount of onions, so he uses 2 * 2 = 4 pounds.
- The cost of onions is $2.00 per pound, so 4 pounds will cost 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock:
- He needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box is $2.00, so the total cost for beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to get the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of onions + cost of beef stock = $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Finally, we divide the total cost by the number of servings to find the cost per serving:
- The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $2.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater and then determine how much earlier she needs to leave to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.

1. Wayne's drive time to the theater is 4 minutes.
2. Bernadette's drive time is four times Wayne's, so it is 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.
3. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to account for her 16-minute drive plus the 5-minute head start.

Now, we add the 5 minutes to Bernadette's drive time to find out how much earlier she needs to leave compared to Wayne's departure time:

16 minutes (drive time) + 5 minutes (head start) = 21 minutes

Bernadette should leave 21 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room and the length, so we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

Area = Length × Width

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length to feet because the area is given in square feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so:

Length in feet = 3 yards × 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now we can solve for the width:

360 square feet = 9 feet × Width
Width = 360 square feet / 9 feet
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

Perimeter = 2 × (Length + Width)

Substituting the values we have:

Perimeter = 2 × (9 feet + 40 feet)
Perimeter = 2 × 49 feet
Perimeter = 98 feet

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon.
   - Swim: 40 minutes
   - Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
   - Run: 50 minutes
   - Total time for Jon: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

2. Next, we calculate the time it took James to complete the swim, which is 10% faster than Jon.
   - 10% of 40 minutes is 4 minutes (10/100 * 40 = 4)
   - James's swim time: 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

3. James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon.
   - James's bike time: 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

4. We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's.
   - James's total time: 170 + 10 = 180 minutes

5. Now we can calculate the time it took James to complete the run by subtracting the swim and bike times from his total time.
   - James's run time: 180 - (36 + 85) = 180 - 121 = 59 minutes

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run.

Next, we need to determine how much hay the horse will eat for running 16 miles. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay the horse will eat is:
16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails of hay

Now, let's calculate the cost of 8 bails of hay. Since each bail costs $3, the total cost is:
8 bails * $3/bail = $24

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, so he has a total of:
6 * $5 = $30

The total cost with the regular ticket, popcorn, and soda is $12 + $3 + P.

You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, so the cost of the regular ticket, popcorn, and soda should be $2 less than the super ticket cost.

So, we have the equation:

$12 + $3 + P = $21 - $2

Now, let's solve for P:

$15 + P = $19
P = $19 - $15
P = $4

The regular price of the popcorn is $4.

"To find out how much the potting soil will cost Bob, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
2. Multiply the volume of one raised bed by the number of beds to get the total volume of soil needed.
3. Determine how many bags of potting soil are required to fill the total volume.
4. Calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Volume of one raised bed:
   Volume = width * length * height
   Volume = 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet
   Volume = 32 cubic feet

2. Total volume for 10 raised beds:
   Total volume = volume of one bed * number of beds
   Total volume = 32 cubic feet * 10
   Total volume = 320 cubic feet

3. Number of bags needed:
   Since each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil:
   Number of bags = total volume / volume per bag
   Number of bags = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet per bag
   Number of bags = 160 bags

4. Total cost:
   Total cost = number of bags * cost per bag
   Total cost = 160 bags * $12 per bag
   Total cost = $1920

The total cost for the potting soil will be $1920.

"To find the total number of cards, we need to calculate the number of green and yellow cards based on the information given and then sum all the cards together.

First, we calculate the number of green cards. There are 60% more green cards than red cards. Since there are 15 red cards, we can find the number of green cards by calculating 60% of 15 and adding that to the 15 red cards.

60% of 15 is:
0.60 * 15 = 9

So, the number of green cards is:
15 + 9 = 24

Next, we calculate the number of yellow cards, which is the sum of the number of red and green cards:
15 (red) + 24 (green) = 39 (yellow)

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the red, green, and yellow cards together:
15 (red) + 24 (green) + 39 (yellow) = 78

The total number of cards is:

"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = Jennifer's puppies + Brandon's puppies
Total number of puppies = 8 + 12
Total number of puppies = 20

Total number of puppies with spots = Jennifer's spotted puppies + Brandon's spotted puppies
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4
Total number of puppies with spots = 7

Now, to find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) * 100

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100

Now we calculate the percentage:

Percentage of puppies with spots = 0.35 * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 35

"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then divide the total weight by the truck's capacity.

1. Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
2. Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
3. Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
4. Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:

Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)
Total weight = 4500 pounds

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, so we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find out how many trips are needed:

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip
Number of trips = 2

Since the number of trips is a whole number, the farmer will need exactly 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To find out how many cents Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the weekly earnings from both the aluminum cans and the plastic bottles, and then multiply by four.

First, we calculate the weekly earnings from the aluminum cans:
3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week

Next, we calculate the weekly earnings from the plastic bottles:
5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

Now, we add the weekly earnings from both cans and bottles to get the total weekly earnings:
6 cents/week + 15 cents/week = 21 cents/week

Finally, we multiply the total weekly earnings by the number of weeks in the month to get the monthly earnings:
21 cents/week * 4 weeks/month = 84 cents/month

So, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month.

"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many plants Toni has based on the information that she has 60% more plants than Frederick.
2. Calculate the number of plants Shondra has, which is 7 fewer than what Toni has.

First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. If Frederick has 10 plants, and Toni has 60% more than Frederick, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.60 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

So, Shondra has 9 plants.

"First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has:

6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 basketball cards

Next, we'll calculate the total number of baseball cards:

5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 baseball cards

Now, we'll add the basketball and baseball cards to find the total number of cards:

150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 cards

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so we subtract those from the total:

350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards

These 300 cards are the ones she gives to her students. If each student gets 10 cards, we can find the number of students by dividing the number of cards given away by the number of cards each student receives:

300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for both Becky and Kelly, taking into account the discounts they received, and then find the difference between the two amounts.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Becky:
- Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each.
- The total cost before the discount is 20 * 45 cents = 900 cents or $9.00.
- Becky received a $1 discount, so the final cost for Becky is $9.00 - $1.00 = $8.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for Kelly:
- Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each.
- The total cost before the discount is 20 * 50 cents = 1000 cents or $10.00.
- Kelly received a 10 percent discount, so the discount amount is 10% of $10.00, which is $1.00.
- The final cost for Kelly is $10.00 - $1.00 = $9.00.

Now, we find the difference between what Kelly paid and what Becky paid:
- Kelly paid $9.00 and Becky paid $8.00.
- The difference is $9.00 - $8.00 = $1.00.

So, Kelly paid $1.00 more than Becky.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Frank starts with 200 shoes.
2. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since a pair is 2 shoes, he gets 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
3. On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
4. On Friday, he gains 30 pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.
5. On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of shoes he will have on Sunday:

Starting shoes: 200
Shoes after Monday: 200 + 10 = 210
Shoes after Wednesday: 210 + 30 = 240
Shoes after Friday: 240 + 60 = 300
Shoes after Saturday: 300 - 180 = 120

So, on Sunday, Frank will have 120 shoes.

"To find out how many carrot sticks Matt has to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we can set the equation equal to 5 and solve for \( c \):

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the term with \( c \):

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Now, multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the shark's length to inches because the remoras' lengths are given in inches.
2. Calculate the combined length of the two remoras.
3. Divide the combined length of the remoras by the shark's length in inches.
4. Multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage.

Let's do the calculations:

1. The shark is 10 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the shark's length in inches is:
   10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches

2. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length is:
   2 remoras * 6 inches/remora = 12 inches

3. The combined length of the remoras as a fraction of the shark's length is:
   12 inches / 120 inches = 0.1

4. To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
   0.1 * 100 = 10%

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To find out how many kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

First, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts:
9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) = 15

However, this sum counts the kids who are allergic to both dairy and peanuts twice, so we need to subtract the number of kids who are allergic to both:
15 - 3 (both) = 12

This means that 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class:
32 (total kids) - 12 (allergic to dairy or peanuts) = 20

The 10th cheerleader, who is the shortest at 60 inches, will be at the top.
The next level will have 2 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall.
The next level will have 3 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall.
The bottom level will have 4 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall.

Let's calculate the total height in inches and then convert it to feet.

Total height in inches = (1 * 60) + (2 * 64) + (3 * 64) + (4 * 64)
Total height in inches = 60 + 128 + 192 + 256
Total height in inches = 636

Now, to convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot).

Total height in feet = 636 / 12
Total height in feet = 53

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now, which means she will be 3 * 14 = 42 years old.
4. Since this is Angela's age in four years, we need to subtract 4 to find her current age: 42 - 4 = 38 years old.

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

"To find out how much money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we need to calculate the cost of his morning and afternoon rides and then add them together.

First, we calculate the cost of the morning rides:
14 days * $6 per morning ride = $84

Next, we calculate the cost of the afternoon rides:
14 days * $2 per afternoon ride = $28

Now, we add the cost of the morning and afternoon rides together:
$84 + $28 = $112

So, Paul spent $112 on driving his car during these two weeks.

"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Ashley brought:

Ashley brought 5 boxes * 10 oranges/box = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

Brianne brought 50 oranges + 20 oranges = 70 oranges.

Now, let's calculate the total number of oranges they have together:

Total oranges = Ashley's oranges + Brianne's oranges
Total oranges = 50 oranges + 70 oranges
Total oranges = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, we can calculate the number of pies they can make:

Number of pies = Total oranges / Oranges per pie
Number of pies = 120 oranges / 3 oranges/pie
Number of pies = 40 pies.

"To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation where the total cost of each venue is the same.

Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 per person for food. So the total cost for the first venue is:
\[ 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per person, which includes food. So the total cost for the second venue is:
\[ 25x \]

We want to find the value of \( x \) where these two costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"Let's denote the number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi as L, D, and B, respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Together they collected 43 insects: L + D + B = 43
2. Lily found 7 more than David: L = D + 7
3. David found half of what Bodhi found: D = B / 2

We can substitute the second and third equations into the first to solve for the variables.

First, let's express B in terms of D using the third equation:
B = 2D

Now, let's substitute L and B in the first equation with their expressions in terms of D:
(D + 7) + D + (2D) = 43

Combine like terms:
4D + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
4D = 36

Divide by 4:
D = 9

Now that we have D, we can find L:
L = D + 7
L = 9 + 7
L = 16

Lily found 16 insects.

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of the skein they each used and then multiply by the total number of yards in a skein.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. First, we add these fractions:

1/4 + 1/2 = 1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4

Now we know they used 3/4 of a skein of yarn together. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we multiply 3/4 by 364 to find the total yards used:

3/4 * 364 = 3 * (364 / 4) = 3 * 91 = 273

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"To find out how many gifts Cherrie bought in total, we need to calculate the number of gifts for the 2 friends who want 5 gifts each, the number of gifts for the 3 friends who want 2 gifts each, and then add the 10 random gifts she decided to buy.

For the 2 friends who want 5 gifts each:
2 friends * 5 gifts/friend = 10 gifts

For the 3 friends who want 2 gifts each:
3 friends * 2 gifts/friend = 6 gifts

Adding the 10 random gifts:
10 random gifts

Now, we add all the gifts together:
10 gifts (for the 2 friends) + 6 gifts (for the 3 friends) + 10 random gifts = 26 gifts

So, Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts.

"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Suzie bought:
- 2 packs of strawberry gum (let's call the cost of each pack S)
- 1 pack of grape gum for $2
- 1 pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $2 / 2 = $1

The total cost of all the gum is $7. We can write the equation as follows:

2S (cost of strawberry gum) + $2 (cost of grape gum) + $1 (cost of green apple gum) = $7

Now we can solve for S:

2S + $2 + $1 = $7
2S + $3 = $7
2S = $7 - $3
2S = $4
S = $4 / 2
S = $2

Each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the number of sticks he can get from each type of wood and then figure out the best combination within his budget.

First, let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

- A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks.
  Cost per stick from 2 x 4 = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

- A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks.
  Cost per stick from 2 x 8 = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood provides a lower cost per stick, it is the cheaper option. However, the question asks for the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber, which in this case is the 2 x 4 piece of wood.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces of wood he can buy with $24:

- Number of 2 x 4 pieces he can buy = $24 / $4 per piece = 6 pieces

Since each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make is:

- Total sticks from 2 x 4 = 6 pieces * 200 sticks per piece = 1200 sticks

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber (2 x 4) is:

"To calculate the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of legs for all dogs.
2. Calculate the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair.

Step 1: Total number of legs
Each dog has 4 legs, and Mario has 6 dogs.
Total legs = 4 legs/dog * 6 dogs = 24 legs

Step 2: Number of pairs of snowshoes
Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the number of pairs.
Number of pairs = 24 legs / 2 legs/pair = 12 pairs

Step 3: Total cost
Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
Total cost = 12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00

Therefore, it will cost Mario $144.00 to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs.

"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the bus trips without the pass:
- Janet takes 2 bus trips per day.
- Each bus trip costs $2.20.
- She takes these trips 5 days a week.

Total cost per week without the pass:
2 trips/day * $2.20/trip * 5 days/week = $22.00/week

Now, let's subtract the cost of the weekly bus pass from the total cost without the pass to find the savings:
$22.00/week - $20.00/week = $2.00/week

So, Janet would save $2.00 per week by buying a weekly bus pass.

4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals:

- Farm animals: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
- Zoo animals: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Combined, the farm and zoo have:

"To calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to reach his goal, we first need to determine the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th, and then calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.

1. Calculate the total number of days:
- From January 1st to July 19th (since today is December 31st, we start counting from the next day, January 1st):
- January has 31 days, but we start on the 1st, so we count 31 days.
- February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year).
- March has 31 days.
- April has 30 days.
- May has 31 days.
- June has 30 days.
- July has 19 days up to the 19th.

Adding these up: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days.

2. Calculate the total number of calories to lose 30 lbs:
- 30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories.

3. Calculate the daily calorie deficit:
- 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories/day.

So, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to reach his goal.

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second, we get:

"Let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C_O \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has, and \( S_O \) be the number of sofas Ophelia has. According to the problem, Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so we can write:

\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]

We are also told that Ophelia has 20 sofas, so:

\[ S_O = 20 \]

Substituting the value of \( S_O \) into the first equation, we get:

\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]

Solving for \( C_O \), we find:

\[ C_O = 20 + 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Now, let's consider Jenna. Let \( C_J \) be the number of chairs Jenna has, and \( S_J \) be the number of sofas Jenna has. We know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so:

\[ C_J = 3 \times C_O \]
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]

Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so:

\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]

Now we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together:

Total sofas = \( S_O + S_J \)
Total sofas = \( 20 + 64 \)
Total sofas = \( 84 \)

Total chairs = \( C_O + C_J \)
Total chairs = \( 22 + 66 \)
Total chairs = \( 88 \)

Total number of sofas and chairs = Total sofas + Total chairs
Total number of sofas and chairs = \( 84 + 88 \)
Total number of sofas and chairs = \( 172 \)

"To calculate the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the variations in his routine.

First, we'll calculate the total hours if he had worked out 4 hours every week for 8 weeks:
4 hours/week * 8 weeks = 32 hours

Next, we'll add the extra hours he spent working out on the occasions that were different:
- For the two consecutive weeks where he spent 5 hours each week, he worked out an extra hour each week compared to the usual 4 hours, so that's 2 extra hours in total.
- For the week where he spent 6 hours, he worked out 2 extra hours compared to the usual 4 hours.

So, the total extra hours are:
2 extra hours (from the two 5-hour weeks) + 2 extra hours (from the 6-hour week) = 4 extra hours

Now, we add the extra hours to the initial total:
32 hours (initial total) + 4 hours (extra hours) = 36 hours

"To find the cost of one monitor, we can start by determining the cost of the printer. Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost:

$1,100 - $400 = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, the printer, and the two monitors is $2,400. We can set up the following equation to find the cost of the two monitors:

Cost of computer + Cost of printer + 2 * Cost of one monitor = Total cost
$1,100 + $700 + 2 * Cost of one monitor = $2,400

Now we can solve for the cost of one monitor:

2 * Cost of one monitor = $2,400 - ($1,100 + $700)
2 * Cost of one monitor = $2,400 - $1,800
2 * Cost of one monitor = $600

Divide both sides by 2 to find the cost of one monitor:

Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

So, the cost of one monitor is $300.

"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we need to calculate the number of seashells the girls brought based on the information given.

The boys brought back 60 shells each. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means each girl brought:

60 (the number of shells each boy brought) + 4 * 60 (four times the number of shells each boy brought)

Let's calculate that:

60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300

So, each girl brought 300 seashells.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to add the thickness of each book together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 mm = 62 mm thick.

Now, we add the thickness of all four books together:

31 mm (first book) + 50 mm (second book) + 45 mm (third book) + 62 mm (fourth book) = 188 mm

"To calculate the total amount you need to pay, first, determine the tip amount and then add it to the original bill. After that, since the bill is to be split evenly, you will pay half of the bill plus the entire tip.

1. Calculate the tip: 20% of $50 is $10.
2. Add the tip to the original bill: $50 + $10 = $60.
3. Since the bill is split evenly, you pay half of the original bill: $50 / 2 = $25.
4. Add the tip to your half of the bill: $25 + $10 = $35.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125.

April has 30 days, so the first half of the month consists of 15 days, and the second half also consists of 15 days.

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of the month as \( x \). According to the problem, he saves twice as much each day in the second half, which would be \( 2x \).

The total savings for the month can be expressed as:
\[ 15x + 15(2x) = 1125 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Since \( x \) is the amount saved each day in the first half, the amount saved each day in the second half is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

So, Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of April.

5 oranges * $0.80/orange = $4.00

The cost of the peaches is:
6 peaches * $0.75/peach = $4.50

The total cost of the fruits is:
$4.50 (apples) + $4.00 (oranges) + $4.50 (peaches) = $13.00

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's say Brad gets \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find out how much Brad gets, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} \]
\[ B = 20 \]

Now that we know Brad gets 20 dollars, we can find out how much Jeff gets by multiplying Brad's amount by 4:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 \]
\[ 4B = 80 \]

So, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys Jonathan currently has. We know that James has 80 toys and that Jonathan needs a play set five times larger than James's to have enough toys for a sorted play set. This means Jonathan needs 5 * 80 toys to have a play set five times larger than James's.

Let's calculate the number of toys Jonathan needs for the sorted play set:

5 * 80 = 400 toys

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach this number. Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

"To calculate the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we first need to find the total cost without the discount, and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of five notebooks is:

The cost of two pens is:
2 pens * $0.25/pen = $0.50

The cost of one calculator is:
1 calculator * $12.00/calculator = $12.00

The cost of one geometry set is:
1 geometry set * $10.00/geometry set = $10.00

The total cost without the discount is:
$7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

Now, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

The total cost with the discount is:
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Ray takes to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water, and then find the difference between the two times.

First, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim 1 mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. Since it takes him 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, we can calculate the time for warm water as follows:

Warm water time for 1 mile = 2 * (Cold water time for 1 mile) + 2 minutes
Warm water time for 1 mile = 2 * 16 minutes + 2 minutes
Warm water time for 1 mile = 32 minutes + 2 minutes
Warm water time for 1 mile = 34 minutes

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles in both conditions:

Cold water time for 3 miles = 3 * (Cold water time for 1 mile)
Cold water time for 3 miles = 3 * 16 minutes
Cold water time for 3 miles = 48 minutes

Warm water time for 3 miles = 3 * (Warm water time for 1 mile)
Warm water time for 3 miles = 3 * 34 minutes
Warm water time for 3 miles = 102 minutes

Finally, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water:

Difference in time = Warm water time for 3 miles - Cold water time for 3 miles
Difference in time = 102 minutes - 48 minutes
Difference in time = 54 minutes

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day.

Susan's weight = 150 pounds - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 130 pounds

Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, so:
Bob's weight = 2 * Susan's weight
Bob's weight = 2 * 130 pounds
Bob's weight = 260 pounds

Now, to find the average weight, we add the weights of all three friends and divide by the number of friends:

Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3
Average weight = (150 pounds + 130 pounds + 260 pounds) / 3

Total money: $70
Number of days for wooden action figures: 4
Total spent on wooden action figures: 4 days * $5/action figure

Let's calculate the number of wooden action figures he can buy each day and the total for these 4 days:

Daily spending on wooden action figures: $70 / 7 days = $10/day
Number of wooden action figures per day: $10 / $5 = 2 action figures/day
Total wooden action figures for 4 days: 2 action figures/day * 4 days = 8 action figures

Now, we need to calculate how much money he has left for the rest of the week:

Money left after 4 days: $70 - (4 days * $10/day) = $70 - $40 = $30

For the remaining 3 days (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. We can calculate the number of plastic action figures he can buy each day and the total for these 3 days:

Daily spending on plastic action figures: $10/day (as he spends an equal amount each day)
Number of plastic action figures per day: $10 / $2 = 5 action figures/day
Total plastic action figures for 3 days: 5 action figures/day * 3 days = 15 action figures

Finally, we add the total number of wooden and plastic action figures to get the total number of action figures:

Total action figures: 8 wooden + 15 plastic = 23 action figures

Katina withdraws $100 every month. There are 12 months in a year, so over 2 years, she will make:

2 years * 12 months/year = 24 months

The total amount withdrawn over 24 months will be:

24 months * $100/month = $2400

Now, we subtract the total amount withdrawn from the initial balance:

$3000 - $2400 = $600

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her savings account.

"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total cost and the total revenue, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches:
- Cost of bread per loaf: $3.00
- Each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, so the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00.

Next, the cost of cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches is given as $30.00.

Now, let's add the cost of bread and the cost of cheeses and condiments to get the total cost for 10 sandwiches:
- Total cost for 10 sandwiches = Cost of bread + Cost of cheeses and condiments
- Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 + $30.00
- Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $33.00

The revenue from selling 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each is:
- Revenue = Price per sandwich * Number of sandwiches
- Revenue = $7.00 * 10
- Revenue = $70.00

Finally, the net profit is the revenue minus the total cost:
- Net profit = Revenue - Total cost
- Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
- Net profit = $37.00

"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of small crayon pieces Kate has.
2. Determine how many crayon muffins she can make with those pieces.
3. Calculate the total amount of money she can make by selling the crayon muffins.

Step 1: Total number of small crayon pieces
Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, so the total number of crayon pieces is:
3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayon pieces

Step 2: Number of crayon muffins
Since it takes 8 small pieces to make one crayon muffin, the number of crayon muffins she can make is:
192 crayon pieces / 8 pieces/muffin = 24 crayon muffins

Step 3: Total money made
If she sells each crayon muffin for $1.50, the total amount of money she can make is:
24 crayon muffins * $1.50/muffin = $36.00

So, the final amount of money Kate can make is:
$36.00"
"To calculate the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet, we need to consider the cost of the new carpet, the padding, the removal of the old carpet, and the installation of the new carpet. We will calculate each of these costs based on the area of the bedroom and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the area of the bedroom:
Area = length × width
Area = 18 feet × 12 feet
Area = 216 square feet

Now, let's calculate each of the costs:

1. Cost of the new carpet:
Cost of carpet = area × cost per square foot
Cost of carpet = 216 square feet × $12/square foot
Cost of carpet = $2,592

2. Cost of the padding:
Cost of padding = area × cost per square foot
Cost of padding = 216 square feet × $2/square foot
Cost of padding = $432

3. Cost to remove the old carpet:
Cost of removal = area × cost per square foot
Cost of removal = 216 square feet × $4/square foot
Cost of removal = $864

4. Cost to install the new carpet:
Cost of installation = area × cost per square foot
Cost of installation = 216 square feet × $34/square foot
Cost of installation = $7,344

Now, let's sum up all the costs to get the total cost:
Total cost = Cost of carpet + Cost of padding + Cost of removal + Cost of installation
Total cost = $2,592 + $432 + $864 + $7,344
Total cost = $11,232

The total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is $11,232.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The starting value of the number train is 20.
2. We need to add half of the starting value to the starting value itself.
3. The result from step 2 is then divided by 5.
4. The result from step 3 is then multiplied by the starting value minus 12.

Let's calculate:

1. Starting value: \(20\)
2. Half of the starting value: \(20 / 2 = 10\)
3. Starting value plus half the starting value: \(20 + 10 = 30\)
4. Dividing the result from step 3 by 5: \(30 / 5 = 6\)
5. Starting value minus 12: \(20 - 12 = 8\)
6. Multiplying the result from step 4 by the result from step 5: \(6 * 8 = 48\)

The final value of the number train is \(48\).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then apply that percentage to the desired temperature of 520 degrees.

First, let's find the percentage increase from the set temperature to the actual temperature when the oven is set to 450 degrees.

The actual temperature is 468 degrees, and the set temperature is 450 degrees. The difference is:

468 - 450 = 18 degrees

The percentage increase is:

(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Now, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to so that it reaches 520 degrees, taking into account the 4% increase.

Let x be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be x plus 4% of x:

x + 0.04x = 520

1.04x = 520

Now, we solve for x:

x = 520 / 1.04

x = 500

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the first movie is:
1 hour * 60 minutes/hour + 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. So, the second movie is:
2 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the duration of both movies together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract that from Herb's house value.

30% of $76,000 is:
0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800

So, Juan's house is worth:
$76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, to find the combined value of the two houses, we add the value of Herb's house and Juan's house together:
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The combined value of the two houses is $129,200.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.
2. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.
3. Her friend brought 40 cups to the event.
4. Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend:

- Judy's utensils: 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36 utensils
- Her friend's utensils: 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84 utensils

Adding both together, we get the total number of utensils:

36 utensils (Judy) + 84 utensils (friend) = 120 utensils

"To find out how much each pair of contacts will cost Pete if he buys 2 boxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost for 2 boxes of contacts with the 10% discount.
2. Determine the total number of contacts Pete will get from 2 boxes.
3. Divide the total cost by the total number of contacts to find the cost per contact.

Let's do the math:

1. The cost of 1 box of contacts is $100.00. With a 10% discount, the cost of 1 box is:
   $100.00 - ($100.00 * 0.10) = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

   Therefore, the cost for 2 boxes is:
   $90.00 * 2 = $180.00

2. Each box contains 90 contacts, so 2 boxes will contain:
   90 contacts/box * 2 boxes = 180 contacts

3. The cost per contact is:
   $180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00/contact

Since contacts are typically used in pairs, we need to find the cost per pair of contacts:
   $1.00/contact * 2 contacts/pair = $2.00/pair

The cost per pair of contacts is $2.00.

Total hours worked by Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the total hours worked by John:
- Saturday: 2 * Jill's hours on Saturday = 2 * 2 = 4 hours
- Sunday: 3 * Jill's hours on Sunday = 3 * 1 = 3 hours
Total hours worked by John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Next, we calculate the earnings for both:
- Jill's earnings: 3 hours * $10/hour = $30
- John's earnings: 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

Finally, we find the difference in their earnings:
John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

So, John earned $40 more than Jill.

"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total number of calories she burns during her exercise.

Hannah burns 500 calories per hour doing aerobics. Since she does aerobics for 2 hours, the total calories burned from aerobics is:
500 calories/hour * 2 hours = 1000 calories

Hannah also burns 600 calories per hour running. Since she runs for 1 hour, the total calories burned from running is:
600 calories/hour * 1 hour = 600 calories

The total calories burned from both activities is:
1000 calories (aerobics) + 600 calories (running) = 1600 calories

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned. To find out how much water she needs to drink, we divide the total calories burned by 200 and then multiply by 100 ml:

(1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml = 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water.

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans \( G \) is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. We can express these relationships as:

\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is 4500:

\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} \]
\[ B = 1500 \]

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

\[ R = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is:

\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"To find the average of the three typing speed measurements, we first need to calculate the total sum of the three measurements and then divide by the number of measurements.

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM.
After some lessons, his typing speed increases to 52 WPM.
If he increases his typing speed by another 5 WPM, his new typing speed will be 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM.

Now we add the three measurements together:
47 WPM + 52 WPM + 57 WPM = 156 WPM

To find the average, we divide the total sum by the number of measurements, which is 3:
156 WPM / 3 = 52 WPM

The average of the three measurements is 52 WPM.

"To find out how much each pump of shampoo costs in cents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of washes Jackie can get if she uses 1 pump per wash.
2. Calculate the cost per wash.
3. Convert the cost per wash to cents.

Step 1: Since the bottle gives 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash, if Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, she will get twice as many washes from the bottle.
Total washes with 1 pump per wash = 120 washes * 2 = 240 washes

Step 2: The cost of the bottle is $24.00, so we divide this by the total number of washes to find the cost per wash.
Cost per wash = $24.00 / 240 washes = $0.10 per wash

Step 3: Since we need the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents).
Cost per wash in cents = $0.10 * 100 cents/dollar = 10 cents

Therefore, each pump costs 10 cents.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the additional months.

For the first 5 months, the cost is straightforward:
Initial 5 months cost = $100,000

The research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so the total duration of the research is:
Total duration = 5 months * 10 = 50 months

The additional months of research are:
Additional months = Total duration - Initial 5 months = 50 months - 5 months = 45 months

The cost per month for the additional months is 50% more than the initial monthly cost. Since the initial 5 months cost $100,000 in total, the cost per month for the initial period is:
Initial monthly cost = $100,000 / 5 months = $20,000 per month

The cost per month for the additional months is:
Additional monthly cost = Initial monthly cost * 1.5 = $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month

The total cost for the additional 45 months is:
Additional months cost = Additional monthly cost * 45 months = $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000

Finally, the total cost of the research is the sum of the initial 5 months and the additional 45 months:
Total cost = Initial 5 months cost + Additional months cost = $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000

"The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
The third player ate a one-pound steak, and since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, that's 16 ounces.
The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding up the meat consumed:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of loads Gary does per week.
2. Calculate the number of loads Gary does per year.
3. Calculate the total amount of water used per year.
4. Calculate the total cost of water used per year.

Step 1: Number of loads per week
Gary does laundry twice a week, so he does 2 loads per week.

Step 2: Number of loads per year
There are 52 weeks in a year, so the number of loads per year is:
2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads/year

Step 3: Total amount of water used per year
Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used per year is:
104 loads/year * 20 gallons/load = 2080 gallons/year

Step 4: Total cost of water used per year
A gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost of water used per year is:
2080 gallons/year * $0.15/gallon = $312/year

Therefore, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year.

"To find out how much Scarlett spent, we need to add up the cost of all the items she bought.

The cost of the aquarium is $10.00.
The cost of 2 bags of rocks at $2.50 each is 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.
The cost of 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each is 3 * $2..00 = $6.00.
The cost of 20 fish at $0.50 each is 20 * $0.50 = $10.00.
The cost of fish food is $2.00.

Now, we add all these costs together:

$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

"Jim starts with a 20-pack of gum.

He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, which adds 1 + 1 = 2 pieces of gum.

So, during the day, he chews a total of 4 (at school) + 2 (on the way home and after dinner) = 6 pieces of gum.

Starting with 20 pieces and chewing 6, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces of gum left before giving any to his sister.

He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces of gum.

Therefore, at the end of the day, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb per second to kb per hour.
2. Convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour.

Step 1: Convert kb per second to kb per hour.
There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.
Ashley's speed is 20 kb per second, so in one hour, she can download:
20 kb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72000 kb/hour

Step 2: Convert kb per hour to Mb per hour.
Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we divide the total kb per hour by 1000 to get Mb per hour.
72000 kb/hour / 1000 kb/Mb = 72 Mb/hour

Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height and Adam's current height, and then divide that by the rate at which he grows each year.

The required height to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the required height in inches is:
4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Adam's current height is 40 inches. The difference between the required height and Adam's current height is:
48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches

Adam grows 2 inches a year, so the number of years it will take for him to grow the additional 8 inches is:
8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find out how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sales amount for the 10 cars.
2. Determine the cost to acquire the cars.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the acquisition cost from the total sales.
4. Calculate James's commission based on the profit.

Let's do the math:

1. Total sales amount for 10 cars:
   10 cars * $25,000 per car = $250,000

2. Cost to acquire the cars (30% of the total sales):
   30% of $250,000 = 0.30 * $250,000 = $75,000

3. Profit from the sales:
   Total sales - Acquisition cost = $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

4. James's commission (10% of the profit):

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The price of a diamond jewel is given as $2000.
2. The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. So, the price of a gold jewel is:
   \( \text{Price of Gold Jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times \text{Price of Diamond Jewel} \)
   \( \text{Price of Gold Jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 \)
   \( \text{Price of Gold Jewel} = 1600 \)

3. The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. So, the price of a silver jewel is:
   \( \text{Price of Silver Jewel} = \text{Price of Gold Jewel} - 400 \)
   \( \text{Price of Silver Jewel} = 1600 - 400 \)
   \( \text{Price of Silver Jewel} = 1200 \)

4. The total price for all three jewels is the sum of the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:
   \( \text{Total Price} = \text{Price of Diamond Jewel} + \text{Price of Gold Jewel} + \text{Price of Silver Jewel} \)
   \( \text{Total Price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 \)

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between them. The difference in their speeds is the rate at which Tom is closing the gap.

Tom's speed: 70 mph
Bob's speed: 55 mph
Relative speed (Tom's speed - Bob's speed): 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

This means Tom is gaining 15 miles on Bob every hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up, we divide the distance by the relative speed:

Time = Distance / Relative Speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if he misses some. The total cost of the classes is $60, and there are 10 classes in total.

If Manny misses a class, the cost per class for the attended classes will increase. We need to find the point at which the cost per class exceeds $10.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). The number of classes he attends will then be \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class when he misses \( x \) classes is \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the maximum \( x \) such that \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \).

Solving the inequality:

\[
\frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
\]

\[
60 \leq 10(10 - x)
\]

\[
60 \leq 100 - 10x
\]

\[
10x \leq 40
\]

\[
x \leq 4
\]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10. If he misses 5 or more classes, the cost per class will be more than $10, and his parents won't sign him up again.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to determine how many customers Julie can process daily, and then we can calculate the total for both of them for the week.

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers daily, Julie processes:

50 customers/day * 2 = 100 customers/day

Now, we can calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in a day:

Julie's daily customers + Jewel's daily customers = Total daily customers
100 customers/day + 50 customers/day = 150 customers/day

Since they work all days of the week, we multiply the total daily customers by 7 to get the weekly production:

150 customers/day * 7 days/week = 1050 customers/week

The total weekly production for the two is:

Since we know Reggie ran 20 miles, we can set up the equation:

L + 3 = 20

Now, we solve for L:

L = 20 - 3
L = 17

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to calculate the volume of the hole and then multiply that by the time it takes him to shovel a cubic foot of earth.

The volume of the hole is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and depth:

Volume = Length × Width × Depth
Volume = 6 feet × 4 feet × 3 feet
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Now, if it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, the total time to dig the hole is:

Total time = Volume × Time per cubic foot
Total time = 72 cubic feet × 3 seconds/cubic foot
Total time = 216 seconds

To convert the time into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

Total time in minutes = 216 seconds ÷ 60 seconds/minute
Total time in minutes = 3.6 minutes

However, since the question asks for the final numerical answer and it is typically expected in the base unit used for the time per cubic foot (which is seconds in this case), we will provide the answer in seconds.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

"To calculate Tim's new annual salary after the promotion, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new monthly salary after the 5% raise.
2. Calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary based on the new salary.
3. Calculate the total annual salary, which is the sum of the 12 months of the new salary plus the bonus.

Step 1: New monthly salary after 5% raise
New monthly salary = Original monthly salary + (5% of original monthly salary)
New monthly salary = $20,000 + (0.05 * $20,000)
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000
New monthly salary = $21,000

Step 2: Calculate the bonus
Bonus = 0.5 * New monthly salary
Bonus = 0.5 * $21,000
Bonus = $10,500

Step 3: Calculate the total annual salary
Total annual salary = (New monthly salary * 12) + Bonus
Total annual salary = ($21,000 * 12) + $10,500
Total annual salary = $252,000 + $10,500
Total annual salary = $262,500

So, Tim will make $262,500 in a year.

"To find out how many miles Alisa and Stanley biked in total, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add those distances together.

The formula to calculate distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Alisa:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 12 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4.5 \, \text{hours} \]

For Stanley:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2.5 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, let's calculate each distance:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 12 \times 4.5 = 54 \, \text{miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 10 \times 2.5 = 25 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the two distances together gives us the total distance:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} + \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 54 + 25 = 79 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles.

"To calculate the total time Bill will take to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, and then add these times together.

First, we calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill can dig 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.
- Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet per hour = 6 hours.

Next, we calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill can dig at half the speed through clay, so he can dig 2 feet per hour through clay.
- He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay.
- Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet per hour = 4 hours.

Now, we add the time to dig through soil and clay to get the total time:
- Total time = Time through soil + Time through clay = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

So, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is 10 hours.

"To find out how many cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to calculate the total number of people who will receive cupcakes and then multiply that by 2, since he plans to get one vanilla and one chocolate cupcake for each person.

The total number of people is:
- Howie himself: 1
- His teacher: 1
- His classmates: 25

So, the total number of people is 1 + 1 + 25 = 27.

Since Howie wants to buy 2 cupcakes for each person, we multiply the total number of people by 2:
27 people * 2 cupcakes/person = 54 cupcakes.

Therefore, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

"To find the total number of Instagram likes Fishio received, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of likes after three weeks, which is 70 times the initial number of likes.
2. Add the initial number of likes to the number of likes after three weeks.
3. Add the 20,000 new likes she received recently to the total from step 2.

Let's calculate:

1. Initial likes: 2000
2. Likes after three weeks: 2000 * 70 = 140000
3. Total likes before the recent 20,000: 2000 + 140000 = 142000
4. Total likes after the recent 20,000: 142000 + 20000 = 162000

So, the total number of Instagram likes is:

"To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for Clara and Sheila, taking into account the discounts and vouchers.

First, let's calculate the cost for Clara:

- Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each.
- The total cost before the voucher is 20 pomegranates * $20/pomegranate = $400.
- She got a $2 off voucher, so the final cost for Clara is $400 - $2 = $398.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Sheila:

- Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at the new price of $30 each.
- The total cost before the discount is 20 pomegranates * $30/pomegranate = $600.
- The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is 10% of $600 = 0.10 * $600 = $60.
- The final cost for Sheila after the discount is $600 - $60 = $540.

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid:

- The difference is $540 (Sheila's cost) - $398 (Clara's cost) = $142.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $142.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Ariadne's sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
2. The sales from green hats were twice the sales from red hats, so the sales from green hats were $400 * 2 = $800.
3. The total sales for the first month are the sum of the sales from red and green hats, which is $400 + $800 = $1200.
4. In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month, so the sales for the second month were $1200 * 3/4 = $900.
5. The total amount she made in two months is the sum of the sales from the first and second months, which is $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The final numerical answer is:

"James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost of the previous hour.

So the cost for the second hour is $15 * 2 = $30.
The cost for the third hour is $30 * 2 = $60.

Adding these up, the total cost is $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed for the guests.
2. Determine how many whole eggs are required based on the number of deviled egg halves.
3. Convert the number of whole eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Total number of deviled egg halves needed
Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests.
Total deviled egg halves = 3 halves/guest * 16 guests = 48 halves

Step 2: Number of whole eggs required
Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we can find the number of whole eggs needed by dividing the total number of deviled egg halves by 2.
Number of whole eggs = 48 halves / 2 halves/egg = 24 eggs

Step 3: Convert whole eggs to dozens
There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the number of whole eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.
Number of dozens = 24 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 2 dozens

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

Number of days to complete the book: 200 pages / 10 pages/day = 20 days

Since the assignment is to be completed within 30 days, we can find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish by subtracting the number of days it will take him to read the book from the total number of days available.

Days before the deadline: 30 days - 20 days = 10 days

"To calculate the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel expenses.

1. Initial cost of the plane: $150,000
2. Monthly hanger rental: $5,000
3. Monthly fuel expenses: $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Now, we calculate the total monthly maintenance cost (hanger rental + fuel expenses) and then multiply by 12 to get the annual maintenance cost.

Monthly maintenance cost: $5,000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000
Annual maintenance cost: $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost to get the total cost for the first year.

Total cost for the first year: $150,000 (initial cost) + $180,000 (annual maintenance) = $330,000

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Finley cooked rice for 30 minutes.
2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so the cooking time for pork is 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.
3. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 minutes + 50 minutes = 80 minutes.
4. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so the cooking time for beans is 80 minutes / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, to find out how long it took to cook all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:

30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) + 40 minutes (beans) = 120 minutes.

- 1/2 pound of almonds at $10 per pound: (1/2) * $10 = $5
- 1/3 pound of walnuts at $15 per pound: (1/3) * $15 = $5
- Total cost of the first mixture: $5 + $5 = $10

Now, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture:
- 1/5 pound of almonds at $10 per pound: (1/5) * $10 = $2
- 1/3 pound of walnuts at $15 per pound: (1/3) * $15 = $5
- Total cost of the second mixture: $2 + $5 = $7

Finally, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- Difference: $10 - $7 = $3

The first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. We know that the total number of legs is 70, so we can write the first equation as:

\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We also know that the total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20, so we can write the second equation as:

\[ S + G = 20 \]

Now we can solve this system of equations. We can start by solving the second equation for \( G \):

\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, we substitute \( G \) in the first equation:

\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):

\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

So the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

For 7 pounds, the cost is 7 * $6 = $42.

He also bought a donut for $2.

The total cost is the cost of the coffee plus the cost of the donut:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much money Kassidy has. We know that Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120.

   Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
   Kassidy's money = 3/4 * $120
   Kassidy's money = $90

2. Next, we need to find out how much money Rayna has. We know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy.

   Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + $60
   Rayna's money = $90 + $60
   Rayna's money = $150

3. Now we can calculate the total amount of money they have together.

   Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
   Total money = $120 + $90 + $150
   Total money = $360

4. Finally, we need to find out how much each person would have if they shared the total amount equally.

   Money per person = Total money / 3

Since a month typically has 30 or 31 days, and we are considering a 30-day period, we need to determine how many days are left in the month after the next three days. There are 30 - 3 = 27 days that have already been accounted for, which means there are 30 - 27 = 3 days left in the month.

However, the question asks for the number of good days left in the month, and we have already determined that the next three days included two good days. Since these two good days are already counted in the 14 good days, there are no additional good days left in the month.

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 0.

From point 1, we can express the number of cookies Max has as:
Max = Katarina + 5

Since Katarina has 68 cookies:
Max = 68 + 5
Max = 73

From point 2, we can express the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as:
Cookie Monster = Max - 12

"To find the original length of the dress, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( L \).

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the extension is \( 0.5L \). She also adds an additional 20cm with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is 140cm. So, the equation to represent this situation is:

\[ L + 0.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( L \):

\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( L \):

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write:

\[ T = R + 7 \]

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can write the equation for their combined ages as:

\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Now we can substitute \( T \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 44 - 14 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now that we have the age of one of the triplets, we can find the age of one of the twins:

\[ T = R + 7 \]
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. We also know that each lollipop costs $0.40.

First, we calculate the total cost of the lollipops:
5 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $2.00

Now we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the four candies:
$3.20 total cost - $2.00 cost of lollipops = $1.20 cost of four candies

Next, we find the cost of one candy by dividing the total cost of the candies by the number of candies:
$1.20 cost of four candies / 4 candies = $0.30 per candy

Now that we know the cost of one candy, we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
10 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $4.00
10 candies * $0.30 per candy = $3.00

Finally, we add the cost of the 10 lollipops and the 10 candies to find the total cost:
$4.00 cost of 10 lollipops + $3.00 cost of 10 candies = $7.00

The total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $7.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over a period of ten years, which is 120 months (10 years * 12 months/year).

Rong saves 20 coins every month. So, in 120 months, Rong will have saved:
20 coins/month * 120 months = 2400 coins

Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong each month. This means Neil saves:
20 coins/month + (2/5 * 20 coins/month) = 20 coins/month + 8 coins/month = 28 coins/month

So, in 120 months, Neil will have saved:
28 coins/month * 120 months = 3360 coins

Together, Rong and Neil will have saved:
2400 coins (Rong) + 3360 coins (Neil) = 5760 coins

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.

2 vaccines * $20/vaccine = $40

Let's denote the total bill as T. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so we can write the following equation:

Heartworm check = 0.60 * T

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:

T = $40 + Heartworm check

Substituting the heartworm check with 0.60 * T, we get:

T = $40 + 0.60 * T

Now, we need to solve for T. To do this, we can subtract 0.60 * T from both sides of the equation:

T - 0.60 * T = $40

0.40 * T = $40

Now, divide both sides by 0.40 to solve for T:

T = $40 / 0.40
T = $100

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:

$125 - $100 = $25

"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum them up.

1. The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, so:
   Cost of one banana = 2 * $0.5 = $1.0

2. The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so:
   Cost of one orange = 3 * $1.0 = $3.0

3. Now we can calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
   - Total cost of bananas = 5 bananas * $1.0/banana = $5.0
   - Total cost of apples = 12 apples * $0.5/apple = $6.0
   - Total cost of oranges = 7 oranges * $3.0/orange = $21.0

4. Finally, we sum up the total costs to get the price of the crate:
   Total price of the crate = $5.0 + $6.0 + $21.0 = $32.0

"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the number of squares of each color and then sum them up.

1. Red squares: 14
2. Blue squares: 14 (red) + 4 = 18
3. Green squares: 18 (blue) + 6 = 24
4. White squares: 24 (green) - 12 = 12

Now, we add up all the squares to get the total number of 1-foot by 1-foot squares, which will also be the total square footage of the comforter.

Total squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white)

Total squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12

Total squares = 68

Since each square is 1 square foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of chairs required for the function and compare it to the number of chairs Mia's restaurant currently has.

First, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed:
- There are 42 adults, and each adult will need a regular chair.
- There are 15 babies, and each baby will need a high chair.

Total chairs needed = 42 (for adults) + 15 (for babies) = 57 chairs

Next, let's determine how many chairs the restaurant currently has:
- The restaurant has 8 high chairs.
- The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, so it has 5 * 8 = 40 regular chairs.

Total chairs available = 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48 chairs

Now, we need to find out how many more chairs are required:
- Chairs needed - Chairs available = 57 - 48 = 9 more chairs

Mia has to get 9 more chairs.

"First, let's calculate the points each student has collected:

- Adam has 50 points.
- Betty collected 30% more points than Adam, so she has 50 + (30% of 50) = 50 + (0.30 * 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 points.
- Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
- Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all the students:

Total points = Adam's points + Betty's points + Tom's points + Martha's points
Total points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105
Total points = 255

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points they have from the threshold:

Points missing = Minimum threshold - Total points
Points missing = 400 - 255
Points missing = 145

15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we calculate:
40% of 300 fireworks = 0.40 * 300 = 120 fireworks

Next, we calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:
3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks

"To find the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the percent of the river's water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract that from the total percent of water used by the city to find the percent used for non-industrial purposes.

Step 1: The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. So, the percent of the river's water used for industrial purposes is:
40% * 80% = 0.40 * 0.80 = 0.32 or 32%

Step 2: The percent of the river's water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is the total percent used by the city minus the percent used for industrial purposes:
40% - 32% = 8%

Therefore, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person ate and then subtract that from the total number of slices available.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, they each ate:
2/3 * 12 = 8 slices

The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas, so they each ate:
3/4 * 12 = 9 slices

Now, we calculate the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends:
3 people * 8 slices/person = 24 slices

And the total number of slices eaten by the other two friends:
2 people * 9 slices/person = 18 slices

The total number of slices eaten by all five friends is:
24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices

Since there were 5 pizzas and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices available was:
5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices available to find out how many slices were left:
60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how long it takes the dog to eat nine sausages. Since the dog can eat the same number of sausages in 2/3 the time it takes the cat, we calculate the dog's time as follows:

Time for the dog to eat nine sausages = 2/3 * 30 minutes = 20 minutes

Now, we have the time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat nine sausages:
- Cat: 30 minutes
- Dog: 20 minutes

To find the average time, we add the two times together and divide by 2 (since there are two animals):

Average time = (Time for cat + Time for dog) / 2
Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2
Average time = 50 minutes / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches.

Topher's shoe length in inches is:
8 feet * 12 inches/foot + 4 inches = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

Now, we are given that the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as \( x \) inches. We can set up the following equation:

\( 9x + 10 = 100 \)

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\( 9x = 100 - 10 \)
\( 9x = 90 \)
\( x = 90 / 9 \)
\( x = 10 \)

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To find out how many windows Hannah smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each car has 4 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in students' cars is 64 * 4 = 256 windows.

Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows:
- A quarter of 256 windows is 256 / 4 = 64 windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each car has 2 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in teachers' cars is 32 * 2 = 64 windows.

Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows:
- Three-quarters of 64 windows is (3/4) * 64 = 48 windows.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed in students' cars to the number of windows smashed in teachers' cars to get the total number of windows smashed:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (students' windows) + 48 (teachers' windows) = 112 windows.

"To find the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of blue spools (light blue and dark blue).
2. Calculate the total number of all spools.
3. Divide the number of blue spools by the total number of spools.
4. Multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage.

Let's do the math:

1. Total number of blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60 spools
2. Total number of all spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150 spools
3. Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100

"At 8:00, there were 5000 people lined up to vote.

By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. To find out how many people that is, we calculate:
2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people

So, 2000 people had voted by midday, which means:
5000 - 2000 = 3000 people had not voted yet.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining 3000 people had voted. To find out how many people that is, we calculate:
2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people

So, 2000 more people had voted by 16:00, which means:
3000 - 2000 = 1000 people had not voted by 16:00.

"To find out how many boxes of graham crackers are needed, we first need to calculate the total number of smores that will be made.

First, we calculate the number of smores the kids will eat:
9 kids * 2 smores per kid = 18 smores

Next, we calculate the number of smores the adults will eat:
6 adults * 1 smore per adult = 6 smores

Now, we add the number of smores for kids and adults to get the total number of smores:
18 smores (kids) + 6 smores (adults) = 24 smores

Each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores, so we need to find out how many sleeves are required for 24 smores:
24 smores / 8 smores per sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we can now determine how many boxes are needed:
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box

Therefore, they will need 1 box of graham crackers.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dora's age is given as 15 years old.
2. Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, Dora's father's age is \(2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38\) years old.
3. Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, Dora's mother's age is \(38 - 4 = 34\) years old.

Now, to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their ages together:

Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age = 15 + 38 + 34

Let's calculate the sum:

15 + 38 + 34 = 87

So, the total combined age is 87.

"To find out how many votes candidate C received, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of votes candidate A received.
2. Calculate the number of votes candidate B received, which is 50% more than candidate A's votes.
3. Subtract the votes of candidates A and B from the total number of votes to find the votes for candidate C.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Candidate A received 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, candidate A received:
   20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes

2. Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A. So, candidate B received:
   50% of 20 votes = 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes more than candidate A
   Therefore, candidate B received:
   20 votes + 10 votes = 30 votes

3. The total number of votes is 100. Subtract the votes of candidates A and B to find the votes for candidate C:
   100 votes - 20 votes (A) - 30 votes (B) = 50 votes

Candidate C received 50 votes.

"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially:

Boris has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has:
100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, if Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have:
100 - 10 = 90 apples.

And Beck will have:
77 + 10 = 87 apples.

Now we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after the transaction:
90 - 87 = 3 apples.

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now.

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for the ice cubes and subtract that from the initial 32 ounces.

First, we calculate the water used for each type of ice cube:

- Giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces/cube = 12 ounces
- Medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces
- Small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 4 ounces

Now, we add up the water used for all the cubes:

12 ounces (giant) + 14 ounces (medium) + 4 ounces (small) = 30 ounces

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:

32 ounces (initial) - 30 ounces (used) = 2 ounces

So, Peter has 2 ounces of water left.

"To solve the problem, let's start by defining the number of books each person has in terms of Steven's books.

Let \( S \) represent the number of books Steven has.

According to the problem:
- Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has \( S + 6 \) books.
- Clara has two times as many books as Steven, so Clara has \( 2S \) books.

We are given that Clara has 20 books, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S = 20 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{20}{2} \]
\[ S = 10 \]

Now we know that Steven has 10 books. We can find out how many books Alice has:
\[ S + 6 = 10 + 6 \]
\[ S + 6 = 16 \]

Alice has 16 books. We already know that Clara has 20 books. To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. We know that a gallon jar costs $5 and that it is $2 more than a half-gallon jar. So, the cost of a half-gallon jar is:

Cost of a half-gallon jar = Cost of a gallon jar - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Now that we know the cost of both a gallon jar and a half-gallon jar, we can calculate the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

Total cost of 10 gallon jars = 10 * Cost of a gallon jar
Total cost of 10 gallon jars = 10 * $5
Total cost of 10 gallon jars = $50

Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * Cost of a half-gallon jar
Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $48

Total amount spent = Total cost of 10 gallon jars + Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars
Total amount spent = $50 + $48
Total amount spent = $98

"To find out how many students like to play video games, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who like to play music.
2. Subtract the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music from the total number of students to find out how many like to play video games.

Step 1: The number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is:
2 * 5 = 10

Step 2: Now, we can subtract the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music from the total number of students to find out how many like to play video games:
50 (total students) - 10 (baking) - 5 (basketball) - 10 (music) = 25

So, the number of students who like to play video games is 25.

Next, we need to find out how many of those students are girls. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, we can calculate the number of girls in one class as follows:

40% of 40 students = 0.40 * 40 = 16 girls

Now, to find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in the class:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.
2. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 27, so she trades 27 small stickers.
3. Since a small sticker is worth one small button, 27 small stickers are worth 27 small buttons.
4. A large button is worth three small stickers, so 27 small buttons can be traded for 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.
5. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 20, so she trades 20 large stickers.
6. Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 20 large stickers are worth 20 large buttons.
7. She has 20 large stickers left (50% of 40) and trades them for small buttons. Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so 20 large stickers are worth 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.
8. Now, let's add up all the buttons she has:
   - 9 large buttons from trading small stickers
   - 20 large buttons from trading half of her large stickers
   - 60 small buttons from trading the rest of her large stickers
   - 3 small stickers that she didn't trade (10% of 30)

\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now that we know the number of votes against the regulation is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor:

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \). According to the problem:

- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs 1/2 of the second, the second needs twice the first).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since it needs double the first).

The total number of cases for all three houses is 250, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

The third house needs double the first house, so it will need:

\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

The third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To find out how many fruits George has in total, we first need to calculate the number of pears he has based on the information that he has 45% more pears than bananas.

If George has 200 bananas, and he has 45% more pears than bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

Number of pears = Number of bananas + (45% of Number of bananas)
Number of pears = 200 + (0.45 * 200)
Number of pears = 200 + 90
Number of pears = 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears:

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
Total number of fruits = 200 + 290
Total number of fruits = 490

"To calculate Tanya's earnings, we need to consider her hourly rate and the additional daily rate if she teaches more than 3 classes.

On Monday:
- She teaches 4 classes, which is more than 3, so she gets an additional $5 for the day.
- She works for 5 hours at $15 per hour, so her earnings for the hours worked are 5 * $15 = $75.
- Adding the additional daily rate, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday:
- She teaches 2 classes, which is not more than 3, so she does not get the additional $5 for the day.
- She works for 2 hours at $15 per hour, so her earnings for the hours worked are 2 * $15 = $30.
- Since she does not qualify for the additional daily rate, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Adding the earnings from both days:
- Total earnings = Monday's earnings + Wednesday's earnings = $80 + $30 = $110.

Therefore, Tanya earned $110 for these two days of teaching.

"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the total time spent driving to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, we calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum:
- Distance to the museum: 150 miles
- Speed: 75 mph

Time to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since the trip back is the same distance and speed, the time to drive back is also 2 hours.

Now, we add the time spent at the museum:
- Time at the museum: 6 hours

Total time gone from home = Time to drive to the museum + Time at the museum + Time to drive back
Total time gone from home = 2 hours + 6 hours + 2 hours = 10 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts:

1. Calculate the number of movies that are part of series.
2. Calculate the cost of the series movies.
3. Calculate the number of remaining movies after the series movies are accounted for.
4. Calculate the number of older movies from the remaining movies.
5. Calculate the cost of the older movies.
6. Calculate the number of normal movies from the remaining movies.
7. Calculate the cost of the normal movies.
8. Sum up the costs from steps 2, 5, and 7 to get the total cost.

Let's start with step 1:

1. Number of series movies: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of 600 movies = \( \frac{600}{3} \) = 200 movies

2. Cost of series movies: Since the series movies cost $6 each, the total cost for series movies is 200 movies * $6/movie = $1200

3. Number of remaining movies: 600 movies - 200 series movies = 400 movies

4. Number of older movies: 40% of the remaining 400 movies = \( 0.40 \times 400 \) = 160 movies

5. Cost of older movies: Since older movies cost $5 each, the total cost for older movies is 160 movies * $5/movie = $800

6. Number of normal movies: 400 movies - 160 older movies = 240 movies

7. Cost of normal movies: Since normal movies cost $10 each, the total cost for normal movies is 240 movies * $10/movie = $2400

8. Total cost: Cost of series movies + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies = $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance they covered while driving and the distance they covered while hiking.

First, let's calculate the distance they drove:
- They drove for 6 hours in total.
- They hiked for 1.5 hours, so they drove for 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours.
- They drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
- The distance they drove is 4.5 hours * 50 miles/hour = 225 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance they hiked:
- They hiked at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
- Half their driving speed is 50 miles per hour / 2 = 25 miles per hour.
- Their hiking speed is 25 miles per hour - 5 miles per hour = 20 miles per hour.
- The distance they hiked is 1.5 hours * 20 miles/hour = 30 miles.

Finally, we add the distances together to get the total distance to the vacation spot:
- Total distance = distance driven + distance hiked = 225 miles + 30 miles = 255 miles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Emma jumps on \( E \) enemies, collects \( B \) berries, and finishes the level with \( T \) seconds left on the timer.

Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies, collects \( B + 3 \) berries, and finishes the level with \( T - 4 \) seconds left on the timer.

The score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Emma's score} = 10E + 5B + 30T \]

The score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4) \]
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 \]
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \]

The difference between their scores is:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Ava's score} - \text{Emma's score} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = -25 \]

So, the difference between their two scores is -25, which means Emma's score is 25 points higher than Ava's.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

After buying more fish, he had a total of:
- 3 + (number of orange fish bought) orange fish
- 4 + (number of white fish bought) white fish

We know that after buying the fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of orange fish bought as O and the number of white fish bought as W. The total number of fish bought is 17, so we have:

O + W = 17

And we also know that the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish after the purchase:

3 + O = 2 * (4 + W)

Now we can solve these equations. First, we'll express O in terms of W from the first equation:

O = 17 - W

Now we substitute O in the second equation:

3 + (17 - W) = 2 * (4 + W)
20 - W = 8 + 2W
20 - 8 = 2W + W
12 = 3W
W = 4

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

- So, the total number of teachers is 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers.
- Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees.

Now, we add the number of trees planted by students and teachers to get the total number of trees planted:
- Total trees = Trees planted by students + Trees planted by teachers
- Total trees = 1000 trees + 240 trees = 1240 trees.

"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy to make them 30% of her collection, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14 stuffed animals.

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as \( g \). After buying the goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + g \), and the goats will make up 30% of this total. We can set up the following equation:

\[ g = 0.30 \times (14 + g) \]

Now we solve for \( g \):

\[ g = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times g \]
\[ g - 0.30 \times g = 0.30 \times 14 \]
\[ 0.70 \times g = 0.30 \times 14 \]
\[ g = \frac{0.30 \times 14}{0.70} \]
\[ g = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ g = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats to make them 30% of her collection.

"Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so for 2 weeks, that's 14 days. Half an hour is 0.5 hours, so:

0.5 hours/day * 14 days = 7 hours

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week, which is 7 days:

2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours

Adding the two amounts together gives the total hours played:

7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours

Kris is trying to earn an achievement for playing a total of 30 hours, so the number of hours she still needs to play is:

30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours

"To find out how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car will travel in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles

The difference in distance between the two cars after 2 hours will be:
140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

So, the two cars will be 20 miles apart after 2 hours.

"To find out how much James paid for the ring, we need to calculate the total cost of the materials and then add the 30% premium.

The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. So, the total cost of the materials is:

$600 (diamond) + $300 (gold) = $900

Next, we calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of the materials:

30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the materials to find out the final amount James paid:

$900 (materials) + $270 (premium) = $1170

So, James paid $1170 for the ring.

"To find the school's overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and divide it by the total number of students.

First, let's find the pass rate for each grade:

- Third graders: 340 out of 500 passed, so the pass rate is 340/500.
- Fourth graders: 40 out of 100 passed, so the pass rate is 40/100.
- Fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it's 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. Since there are 400 fifth graders, the number who passed is 400 * (80/100).

Now, let's calculate the number of fifth graders who passed:

400 * (80/100) = 400 * 0.8 = 320

Next, we'll calculate the total number of students and the total number who passed:

Total students = 500 (third graders) + 100 (fourth graders) + 400 (fifth graders)
Total students = 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Total passed = 340 (third graders) + 40 (fourth graders) + 320 (fifth graders)
Total passed = 340 + 40 + 320 = 700

Finally, we'll calculate the overall pass rate:

Overall pass rate = Total passed / Total students
Overall pass rate = 700 / 1000 = 0.7

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Overall pass rate = 0.7 * 100 = 70%

The school's overall pass rate is 70%.

"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made with the total number of glass chips.
3. Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, divide the total square inches by 3 to find the length in inches.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total number of glass chips:
   - Each bag holds 72 chips.
   - Milo has 2 bags.
   - Total chips = 72 chips/bag * 2 bags = 144 chips.

2. Total square inches of mosaic:
   - It takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch.
   - Total square inches = 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches.

3. Length of the mosaic:
   - The mosaic is 3 inches tall.
   - Length = Total square inches / Height = 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea that was consumed and then add the 10 quarts that were left over. After that, we convert the total quarts to gallons, knowing that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts.

First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students who each drank 1.5 quarts:
4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts

Next, we calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the 16 students who each drank 2 quarts:
16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts

Now, we add the tea consumed by all the students together:
6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts

Then, we add the 10 quarts that were left over to find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party:
38 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts

Finally, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
48 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 12 gallons

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of May and then subtract the initial number of students (10) to find out how many additional students have joined.

Let's break it down month by month:

- At the beginning of the year (January), there are 10 students.
- At the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

Now, to find the number of additional students that have joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students (10) from the total number of students at the end of May (320).

320 - 10 = 310

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to know how many days he worked during the week. A typical week has 7 days. We can then divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch to find out the total number of branches he climbed during the week. After that, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

Let's do the math:

1. Total money made: $105
2. Cost per branch: $0.25
3. Total branches climbed in the week: $105 / $0.25
4. Number of days in a week: 7
5. Average branches climbed per day: (Total branches climbed in the week) / 7

Now, let's calculate:

Total branches climbed in the week = $105 / $0.25 = 420 branches

Average branches climbed per day = 420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches per day

"To find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the number of petals on the flowers Rose picked and then subtract the petals from the flowers she dropped.

1. First, we calculate the total number of petals from the 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
   3 flowers * 5 petals/flower = 15 petals

2. Then, the total number of petals from the 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
   4 flowers * 6 petals/flower = 24 petals

3. Next, the total number of petals from the 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
   5 flowers * 4 petals/flower = 20 petals

4. Lastly, the total number of petals from the 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
   6 flowers * 7 petals/flower = 42 petals

Now, we add all the petals together to get the total before any are dropped:
15 petals + 24 petals + 20 petals + 42 petals = 101 petals

Since Rose drops 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract the petals from one of each type of flower:
1 flower * 5 petals/flower = 5 petals
1 flower * 6 petals/flower = 6 petals
1 flower * 4 petals/flower = 4 petals
1 flower * 7 petals/flower = 7 petals

The total number of petals from the dropped flowers is:
5 petals + 6 petals + 4 petals + 7 petals = 22 petals

Finally, we subtract the petals from the dropped flowers from the total number of petals:
101 petals - 22 petals = 79 petals

So, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money spent by Jack and his three friends playing the arcade games for 4 hours.

First, let's determine how long each person can play with one quarter:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
- Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, which is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter.
- One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter.

Next, we need to calculate how many quarters each person will use in 4 hours (240 minutes):
- Jack: 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters
- Two friends: 240 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters each
- One friend: 240 minutes / 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters

Now, we calculate the total number of quarters used:
- Jack: 12 quarters
- Two friends: 24 quarters each, so 24 * 2 = 48 quarters
- One friend: 8 quarters

Total quarters used = 12 (Jack) + 48 (two friends) + 8 (one friend) = 68 quarters

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is:
68 quarters * $0.25 per quarter = $17.00

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so \( s = 2z \).

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:

\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]

Simplifying the equation, we get:

\[ 2z + 2s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

Since \( s = 2z \), we can substitute \( 2z \) for \( s \) in the equation:

\[ 2z + 4(2z) = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 8z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now that we know \( z \), we can find \( s \):

\[ s = 2z = 2(1) = 2 \]

And the amount of oil is:

\[ 2s = 2(2) = 4 \]

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the terms with \( P \):

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( P \):

\[ P = 47 \]

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick has:

\[ 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and the amount she will be refunded by Amazon.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost:
- The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
- The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.

Shipping cost for weight = 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40
Shipping cost for distance = 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Next, let's calculate the refund amount:

"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then sum them up.

1. Time spent recording TikTok videos:
- Each video is 4 minutes long.
- She records 18 videos each week.
- In a month with four weeks, she records 18 videos/week * 4 weeks = 72 videos.
- The total time spent recording videos is 72 videos * 4 minutes/video = 288 minutes.

2. Time spent writing amateur songs:
- She spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
- In a month with four weeks, she spends 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then calculate the time it would take for the turtles to travel the same distance.

First, let's establish the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can assume that the total distance is the same for one kangaroo, as they are traveling at the same speed. Therefore, one kangaroo would also take 18 hours to travel the same distance.

Now, if a turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, it would take twice as long for a turtle to cover the same distance. So, one turtle would take 18 hours * 2 = 36 hours to travel across the highway.

Since we have four turtles, and they are all traveling at the same speed, the time it takes for them to travel the distance does not change with the number of turtles, as they are not helping each other to travel faster. Each turtle is independent and would take 36 hours to travel the distance.

Therefore, it will take four turtles 36 hours to travel across the highway.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Kora made 20 dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, to find out how many dishes they all made together, we add the number of dishes each person made:

Kora's dishes + Rory's dishes + Jada's dishes = Total dishes
20 + 40 + 80 = 140

So, together they made 140 clay dishes.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after the trade-in, her part-time job pay, and her mom's contribution, and then subtract the amount she still needs to buy the laptop.

The cost of the new laptop is $600, but with the trade-in, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is:

$600 - $200 = $400

Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom is giving her $80, so the total amount from these sources is:

$150 + $80 = $230

Erika still needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she is $50 short of the $400 needed. Therefore, the amount she has, including the money in her purse, is:

$400 - $50 = $350

Now, to find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we subtract the amount she received from her job and her mom from the total amount she has:

$350 - $230 = $120

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To find out how many apple slices are left, we need to calculate the total number of slices Adam gets from slicing the apples and then subtract the number of slices he eats.

First, we calculate the number of slices from the large apples:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

Next, we calculate the number of slices from the small apples:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Now, we add the slices from the large and small apples to get the total number of slices:
15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract that from the total number of slices:
30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices

The number of apple slices left is:

"The farmer currently has 3 cows, each producing 5 liters of milk a day, for a total of 15 liters of milk a day (3 cows * 5 liters/cow = 15 liters/day).

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can calculate the total number of cows needed by dividing the desired daily milk production by the amount of milk one cow can produce:

25 liters/day ÷ 5 liters/cow = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, he needs 5 cows - 3 cows = 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and then sum them up.

1. The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the remaining length is 12 * 1/6 = 2 millimeters.
2. The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the remaining length is 12 * 2/3 = 8 millimeters.
3. The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the remaining length is 12 * 1/2 = 6 millimeters.

Now, we add the remaining lengths together to get the total length of the glue that is not used:

2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

We know that:
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, we need to find out how many students are good at both subjects. We can do this by subtracting the number of students who are good at only one subject from the total number of students.

Total number of students = 20
Number of students good at math only = 5
Number of students good at English only = 8

Number of students good at both = Total number of students - (Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only)
Number of students good at both = 20 - (5 + 8)
Number of students good at both = 20 - 13
Number of students good at both = 7

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the number of students who are good at math only to the number of students who are good at both:

Total number of students good at math = Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at both
Total number of students good at math = 5 + 7
Total number of students good at math = 12

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group will take, including the time to get on stage, perform, and exit the stage. We also need to account for the intermission.

Each group will take:
2 minutes to get on stage
6 minutes to perform
2 minutes to exit the stage
This totals to 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes per group.

The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. If we subtract the 10-minute intermission, we have 120 - 10 = 110 minutes available for performances.

Now, we divide the available performance time by the time each group takes:
110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups.

Therefore, Vicki can have 11 groups perform in the concert.

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to use the formula for simple interest:

\[ A = P(1 + rt) \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

In this case, the interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which means \( r = \frac{3}{4} \) of \( P \) per year. However, the interest rate should be a fraction of the principal, not the principal itself. If the interest is three-quarters of the original amount per year, then the interest rate is \( \frac{3}{4} \) or 0.75 of the principal, but as a rate, it should be 0.75 (or 75%).

Let's calculate the total amount:

\[ P = 300 \]
\[ r = 0.75 \]
\[ t = 3 \]

\[ A = 300(1 + 0.75 \times 3) \]
\[ A = 300(1 + 2.25) \]
\[ A = 300 \times 3.25 \]
\[ A = 975 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $975.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the number of white shirts with collars:
   Half of the 40 white shirts have collars, so 40 / 2 = 20 white shirts have collars.

2. Calculate the number of white shirts with no collars:
   Since there are 40 white shirts in total and 20 have collars, the remaining 40 - 20 = 20 white shirts have no collars.

3. Calculate the number of floral shirts with buttons:
   We are given that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.

4. Calculate the number of floral shirts with no buttons:
   There are 50 floral shirts in total, so 50 - 20 = 30 floral shirts have no buttons.

5. Calculate how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars:
   There are 30 floral shirts with no buttons and 20 white shirts with no collars, so 30 - 20 = 10 more floral shirts with no buttons.

"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes in a year by the total number of pairs of shoes bought in a year.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, so in a year (which has 12 months), he buys:
2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the number of pairs bought:
$2640/year ÷ 24 pairs/year = $110/pair

So, James pays on average $110 for each pair of shoes.

"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of rooms that represent one-half of the total rooms.
2. Determine the total time in minutes to clean that number of rooms.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Step 1: Number of rooms to clean
One-half of 90 rooms is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Step 2: Total time in minutes to clean 45 rooms
It takes 20 minutes to clean each room, so for 45 rooms, it would take 45 * 20 = 900 minutes.

Step 3: Convert minutes to hours
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 900 minutes is 900 / 60 = 15 hours.

3. Add the two amounts together to get the total amount of tips they both received.

Step 1: Rafaela's total tips
Rafaela received a $20 tip from each of the forty customers.
Rafaela's total tips = 40 customers * $20/customer = $800

Step 2: Julieta's total tips
Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, so we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's total and subtract it from Rafaela's total.
10% of Rafaela's total tips = 10/100 * $800 = $80
Julieta's total tips = Rafaela's total tips - 10% of Rafaela's total tips
Julieta's total tips = $800 - $80 = $720

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Claire earns 1 badge every month.
2. Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months.
3. Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 badges every month.

Now, let's calculate the number of badges each person earns in a year (12 months):

- Claire earns 1 badge/month * 12 months/year = 12 badges/year.
- Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months, so she earns 1/2 badge/month * 12 months/year = 6 badges/year.
- Wendy earns 3 badges/month * 12 months/year = 36 badges/year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:

36 badges/year (Wendy) - 6 badges/year (Amber) = 30 badges/year.

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
2. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)
3. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)

We can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to find the value of \( F \).

First, we express \( S \) in terms of \( F \) using the second equation:

\( A = F - 12 \)

So,

\( S = (F - 12) + 25 \)
\( S = F + 13 \)

Now we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in the third equation:

\( (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \)

Combine like terms:

\( 3F + 1 = 85 \)

"To calculate Amy's total score, we need to determine how many points she earns from each type of question and then sum them up.

1. For the multiple-choice questions:
- There are 10 questions, and she answers 80% of them correctly.
- 80% of 10 is 0.80 * 10 = 8 questions.
- Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, she scores 8 * 1 = 8 points.

2. For the true/false questions:
- There are 20 questions, and she answers 90% of them correctly.
- 90% of 20 is 0.90 * 20 = 18 questions.
- Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, she scores 18 * 1 = 18 points.

3. For the long-answer questions:
- There are 5 questions, and she answers 60% of them correctly.
- 60% of 5 is 0.60 * 5 = 3 questions.
- Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points.

Now, we add up the points from all the questions to get her total score:
8 (multiple-choice) + 18 (true/false) + 15 (long-answer) = 41 points.

"To find out how much money Isaias spent to buy the chickens he took to the market for sale, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Subtract the profit from the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

Step 1: Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them.
Number of chickens to sell = 300 * (3/5) = 180 chickens

Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
Each chicken is sold for $50.
Total revenue = 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000

Step 3: Subtract the profit from the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.
Profit = $2000
Cost of the chickens = Total revenue - Profit
Cost of the chickens = $9000 - $2000 = $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000.

"To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we first need to determine how many glasses each of the boys sold. Since Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold a total of 32 glasses and Julie sold 14 glasses, we can subtract Julie's sales from the total to find out how many glasses the boys sold together.

32 glasses (total) - 14 glasses (Julie's sales) = 18 glasses (boys' sales combined)

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the boys' sales by 2 to find out how many each boy sold.

18 glasses (boys' sales combined) / 2 = 9 glasses (each boy's sales)

Now we know that Micah sold 9 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract Micah's sales from Julie's sales.

14 glasses (Julie's sales) - 9 glasses (Micah's sales) = 5 glasses

Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To find out how much money Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then sum them up.

1. The cost of doing her hair is $400.
2. The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the cost of doing her hair, which is 1/4 * $400 = $100.
3. The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, we add up the costs of all three services to find the total amount spent:

$400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575

So, Iris spent a total of $575 at the spa.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling her rope.
2. Determine the length of the new rope she can buy with the money from the sale.
3. Calculate the cost of the new rope.
4. Subtract the cost of the new rope from the total money received from the sale to find out how much money she will have left over.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Sarah's rope is 20 meters long, and she sells it for $2 a meter.
   Total money from sale = 20 meters * $2/meter = $40

2. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter. We need to find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy with $40.
   Length of new rope = Total money from sale / Cost per meter of new rope
   Length of new rope = $40 / $1.5/meter = 26.666... meters

   Since Sarah can't buy a fraction of a meter, we'll assume she buys 26 meters of the new rope.

3. Calculate the cost of 26 meters of the new rope.
   Cost of new rope = 26 meters * $1.5/meter = $39

4. Subtract the cost of the new rope from the total money received from the sale.
   Money left over = Total money from sale - Cost of new rope
   Money left over = $40 - $39 = $1

So, Sarah will have $1 left over after she buys the new rope.

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can calculate her current age by subtracting 10 from 18.

Current age of Melanie = 18 - 10 = 8 years old

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let's denote the number of years it will take for her age to be three times her current age as \( x \).

In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be \( 8 + x \). We want this to be three times her current age, which is \( 3 \times 8 \).

So we set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and then subtract that from her budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the bacon:
5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, so each pack costs $10 / 5 = $2.

Next, the cost of the chicken:
Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet costs $2 * 2 = $4.
The total cost for 6 packets of chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

Now, the cost of the strawberries:
Each pack of strawberries costs $4, so the total cost for 3 packs is 3 * $4 = $12.

Then, the cost of the apples:
Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack costs $4 / 2 = $2.
The total cost for 7 packs of apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
Total cost = cost of bacon + cost of chicken + cost of strawberries + cost of apples
Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14
Total cost = $60

Finally, we subtract the total cost from Kelly's budget to find out how much she has left:
Money left = Kelly’s budget - Total cost
Money left = $65 - $60
Money left = $5

"To find out how many chimichangas the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on each of these days.

On Tuesdays, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Fridays, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which is 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, we add the numbers together:

125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500 chimichangas

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many microphones are left without a pair and then subtract that number from the total to find out how many microphones were paired.

20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in, which means 20% of 50 microphones are left without a pair. Let's calculate that:

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 microphones

These 10 microphones are the ones that cannot be paired. So, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

50 - 10 = 40 microphones

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs is:

40 / 2 = 20 pairs

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we need to first determine the speed of a thingamabob, since the speed of a whirligig is based on the speed of a thingamabob.

We know that:
- A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.
- A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.

Let's denote the speed of a thingamabob as \( T \) meters per second. Then the speed of a whatchamacallit is \( 11T \) meters per second. Since we know the speed of a whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:

\[ 11T = 121 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ T = \frac{121}{11} \]
\[ T = 11 \]

So, a thingamabob spins at 11 meters per second.

Now, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whirligig \( W \) is:

\[ W = 5T \]
\[ W = 5 \times 11 \]
\[ W = 55 \]

The whirligig spins at 55 meters per second.

"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the cost of one carrot as \( c \).

The cost of the salad is $6.
The cost of the yogurt is half the price of the salad, so it is \( \frac{6}{2} = $3 \).

Ellen eats two carrots, so the cost for the carrots is \( 2c \).

The total cost for her daily food is the sum of the cost of the two carrots, the salad, and the yogurt, which is \( 2c + 6 + 3 \).

We know that the total cost is $11, so we can write the equation as:
\[ 2c + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Now we can solve for \( c \):
\[ 2c + 9 = 11 \]
\[ 2c = 11 - 9 \]
\[ 2c = 2 \]
\[ c = \frac{2}{2} \]
\[ c = 1 \]

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
2. We also know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work mowing his lawn.
3. We need to find out how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn to determine how much she made from mowing lawns in total.
4. Once we have the total amount made from mowing lawns, we can subtract it from the total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as J.

From the information given:
- The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3J times.
- The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn 5J times.

The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is the sum of the payments for mowing Joe's, Kamala's, and Alba's lawns. Since Joe paid $6, we can assume that the payment for mowing each lawn is the same. Therefore, the total amount made from mowing lawns is:

Total from mowing = (J + 3J + 5J) * $6
Total from mowing = 9J * $6

We know that the total earnings from all activities is $80, so the amount made from lemonade sales is:

Lemonade sales = Total earnings - Total from mowing
Lemonade sales = $80 - (9J * $6)

To find out the value of J, we need to know how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. However, the problem does not provide this information directly. We can infer that the total amount made from mowing lawns must be a multiple of $6, and it must be less than or equal to $80.

Since we don't have the exact number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, we can assume that the $6 paid by Joe is for one mowing. Therefore, J = 1.

Now we can calculate the total amount made from mowing lawns:

Total from mowing = 9 * 1 * $6
Total from mowing = $54

Now we can calculate the amount made from lemonade sales:

Lemonade sales = $80 - $54
Lemonade sales = $26

So, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

3. Christian’s weight is 8 kg more than Carl’s weight, so Christian's weight is 71 kg + 8 kg = 79 kg.
4. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian’s weight, so Harry's weight is 79 kg - 5 kg = 74 kg.

Harry's weight is 74 kg."
"To find out how much profit John makes on his car, we need to calculate his total earnings from renting out his car and then subtract his car payment from that amount.

First, we calculate the total earnings from renting the car:
- John rents his car 10 times a month.
- Each rental is for 3 hours.
- He gets paid $25 per hour.

Total hours rented in a month = 10 times * 3 hours/time = 30 hours
Total earnings from renting = 30 hours * $25/hour = $750

Now, we subtract the car payment from the total earnings to find the profit:
Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500 = $250

So, John's profit from renting out his car is $250.

4. We can solve for M: M = 7 - 5, which means M = 2.
5. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.
6. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks.
7. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's total from Martha's total: 7 - 6 = 1.

Dijana's distance: 50 miles
1/5 of Dijana's distance: 50 miles * 1/5 = 10 miles

Anis's distance: 50 miles + 10 miles = 60 miles

"Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since he is eating with his adult wife and their two children, we need to calculate how much soup will be left after they all have one bowl for dinner.

First, we calculate the total number of bowls that will be used for dinner:
- 2 adult bowls (Calvin and his wife)
- 2 child bowls (their two children)

So, 2 adult bowls + 2 child bowls = 2 adult bowls + 1 adult bowl (since 2 child bowls equal 1 adult bowl) = 3 adult bowls in total.

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls, so after dinner, there will be:
4 adult bowls - 3 adult bowls = 1 adult bowl left.

Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"To find out how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can calculate the material needed for each type of mask and then add them together.

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- To make 20 small masks, we need to find out how many sets of 4 masks are in 20 masks, which is 20 / 4 = 5 sets.
- Since each set requires 2 yards of material, 5 sets will require 5 * 2 = 10 yards of material.

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- To make 8 large masks, we need to find out how many sets of 3 masks are in 8 masks, which is 8 / 3 ≈ 2.67 sets (rounded to two decimal places).
- Since each set requires 2.25 yards of material, 2.67 sets will require 2.67 * 2.25 ≈ 6.0075 yards of material (rounded to four decimal places).

Now, we add the material needed for the small and large masks together:
- 10 yards (for small masks) + 6.0075 yards (for large masks) ≈ 16.0075 yards.

Rounded to the nearest hundredth, Jo would need 16.01 yards of material.

"To find the total number of acres that Farmer Brown's and Farmer Smith's farms have together, we first need to calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Since Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice that would be:

2 * 200 acres = 400 acres

Adding the additional 100 acres to this, we get:

400 acres + 100 acres = 500 acres

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:

200 acres + 500 acres = 700 acres

Therefore, the two farms together have 700 acres.

A normal Sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes, and an extreme Sudoku takes 4 times that long. So, the time for an extreme Sudoku is:

45 minutes * 4 = 180 minutes

John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, which is every 30 minutes. To find out how many bottles he drinks in 180 minutes, we divide the total time by the interval at which he drinks:

180 minutes / 30 minutes per bottle = 6 bottles

So, John drinks 6 bottles of water during the time it takes him to complete an extreme Sudoku puzzle.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( r \) as the number of red balloons,
- \( y \) as the number of yellow balloons.

From the problem, we know that:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon,
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon,
- Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna,
- There are 20 red balloons.

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown can be represented by the equation:
\[ 2r + 3y = 58 \]

We are given that \( r = 20 \), so we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[ 2(20) + 3y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3y = 58 \]

Now, we solve for \( y \):
\[ 3y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3y = 18 \]
\[ y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ y = 6 \]

So, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs in a 30-day month, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total miles driven in a month:
   100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

2. Determine how many 1000-mile intervals are in 3000 miles:
   3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups

So, Jon's car needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.
2. On Wednesday, he works twice the time he worked on Tuesday, which is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
3. On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than he worked on Wednesday, which is 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, to find the total number of hours Bruce works over these three days, we add the hours from each day together:

5 (Tuesday) + 10 (Wednesday) + 8 (Thursday) = 23 hours

So, the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days is:

"To find out how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide that amount by 2, since they both received the same amount of allowance.

The cost of the cake is $11.
The cost of 1 dozen (12) balloons at $0.5 for 2 balloons is \(12 \div 2 \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = $3\).
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each is \(2 \times 7 = $14\).

The total amount spent is \(11 + 3 + 14 = $28\).

Since this amount is the combined allowance of Julia and Nadine, we divide it by 2 to find out how much each received:
\(28 \div 2 = $14\).

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"To find out how much money the class was able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops and then subtract the total cost of buying them.

First, we calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class:
30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops:
300 lollipops * $0.8/lollypop = $240

Then, we calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops:
300 lollipops * $0.5/lollypop = $150

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
$240 - $150 = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(21 \div 3 = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:

- Cats: 3

- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets: \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\)

"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea.
2. Divide that number by 3 to find out how many cups are in each row.
3. Since the number of chamomile and mint tea cups are equal in each row, divide the number of cups in each row by 2 to find the number of mint tea cups.

First, we know that Lana has 27 cups in total and 15 of them are used for cinnamon tea. So, the number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea is:

27 cups (total) - 15 cups (cinnamon) = 12 cups (chamomile and mint)

Next, we divide the 12 cups of chamomile and mint tea by 3 rows:

12 cups / 3 rows = 4 cups per row

Since the number of chamomile and mint tea cups are equal in each row, we divide the 4 cups per row by 2:

4 cups per row / 2 = 2 cups of mint tea per row

So, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to calculate how many trips he can make in that time.

Since it takes the sloth 4 hours to make one trip (down, pick berries, and back up), in 8 hours, he can make:

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

To collect 24 berries in 2 trips, he must pick up:

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip to meet his goal is 12.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of water Anthony and his father fill into the tank, which is half the amount of water in the pool.
2. Calculate the total amount of water used after 6 days, given the rate of 500 gallons per day.
3. Subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find the remaining amount.

Let's do the calculations:

1. The pool has 10,000 gallons of water, so the tank is filled with half of that:
   \( \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \) gallons.

2. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so after 6 days:
   \( 500 \times 6 = 3,000 \) gallons will have been used.

3. The remaining amount of water in the tank after 6 days is:
   \( 5,000 - 3,000 = 2,000 \) gallons.

"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his total expenses for the month and subtract that from the $150 he was given.

First, let's calculate the cost of the movies he has already seen:
- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays at $10 each: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days at $7 each: 8 * $7 = $56

Next, let's calculate the cost of the popcorn and candy he has already bought:
- 2 tubs of popcorn at $8 each: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy at $2 each: 4 * $2 = $8

Now, let's add up all his expenses so far:
- Movies: $50 + $56 = $106
- Snacks: $16 + $8 = $24
- Total expenses: $106 + $24 = $130

Colby has $150 to spend, so let's see how much he has left:
- Remaining budget: $150 - $130 = $20

On the last day of the month, which is a Friday, he wants to see a movie, get a popcorn, and a box of candy. The cost for this will be:
- Movie ticket: $10
- Popcorn: $8
- Candy: $2
- Total for the night: $10 + $8 + $2 = $20

Since the cost for the night is exactly $20, which is the amount he has left, he can see 1 more movie.

"To find the total number of calories in the mini pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories for each type of pastry and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal one, so it has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.
- Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories for the mini cinnamon rolls are 200 rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories.

Next, we calculate the calories for the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal one, so it has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.
- Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories for the mini blueberry muffins are 300 muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories.

Finally, we add the calories from both types of pastries to get the total:
- Total calories = calories from mini cinnamon rolls + calories from mini blueberry muffins
- Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days and then divide by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, which is 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as Monday, which is again 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add up the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days:

39 (Monday) + 78 (Tuesday) + 78 (Wednesday) + 48 (Thursday) + 57 (Friday) = 300 Junebugs.

To find the average, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days:

300 Junebugs / 5 days = 60 Junebugs per day.

"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then subtract the car's distance from the bus's distance.

The formula to calculate distance is:
Distance = Speed × Time

For the bus:
Distance_bus = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
Distance_car = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, we subtract the car's distance from the bus's distance to find out how much farther the bus went:
Distance_bus - Distance_car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

The number of stuffed animals is 8.
The number of stacking rings is 9.

Let's add these numbers together:

31 (building blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, we subtract the total number of toys Sophie had before the bouncy balls from the new total:

62 (total toys after buying bouncy balls) - 48 (total toys before buying bouncy balls) = 14

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as P, Pa, and J, respectively.

According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   P + Pa + J = 100

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   Pa = J + 10

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   P = Pa + J

We can substitute the second equation into the third to express Peter's age in terms of Jean's age:

P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now we can substitute the expressions for P and Pa from the second and third equations into the first equation:

(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
4J + 20 = 100
4J = 80
J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:

Pa = J + 10
Pa = 20 + 10
Pa = 30

And finally, we can find Peter's age:

P = Pa + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

So, Peter is 50 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of boxes and then determine how many tables are needed to accommodate all the boxes, given that 2 boxes can fit per table. We then subtract the number of tables they already own to find out how many new tables they need.

First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated by the 10 people:
10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes

Now, let's add the 10 boxes they already have:
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all 60 boxes, with 2 boxes per table:
60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

They already own 15 tables, so we subtract that from the total number of tables needed:
30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

Therefore, they need 15 new tables.

"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total revenue generated by each machine over the course of a month and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month:

- The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour.
- The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour.

Both machines run 24 hours a day for 30 days, so the total number of hours each machine runs in a month is:

24 hours/day * 30 days = 720 hours

Now, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month:

- Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 720 hours = 43,200 widgets
- WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 720 hours = 32,400 widgets

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the widgets:

- Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
- WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Finally, we find the difference in revenue between the two machines:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

So, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. The first 12 hours are covered by the 1000 pesos charge. The additional 5 hours (17 hours - 12 hours) will be charged at 70 pesos per hour.

The cost for the additional 5 hours is:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:
1000 pesos (for the first 12 hours) + 350 pesos (for the additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos

If Cameron had chosen the 24-hour stay option, it would have cost him 1600 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron saves by choosing the 12-hour stay plus the additional hours is:

"To find out how many pounds of hay Nate needs, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the amount of hay needed for the goats.
2. Calculate the amount of hay needed for the sheep.
3. Add the two amounts together to get the total.

Step 1: Hay for the goats
Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. With 15 goats, the total hay needed for the goats is:
15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds

Step 2: Hay for the sheep
Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, each sheep needs:
(2 * 5 pounds) - 3 pounds = 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds

With 12 sheep, the total hay needed for the sheep is:
12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

Step 3: Total hay needed
Now, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep:
75 pounds (goats) + 84 pounds (sheep) = 159 pounds

So, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay in total.

"To determine how much money James was out, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs after the discount, then subtract the amount he received from selling the 5 CDs he didn't like.

1. Calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount:
   10 CDs * $15/CD = $150

2. Calculate the discount amount:
   40% of $150 = 0.40 * $150 = $60

3. Calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs after the discount:
   $150 - $60 = $90

4. Calculate the amount James received from selling 5 CDs:
   5 CDs * $40/CD = $200

5. Since the amount he received from selling the CDs is more than the total cost after the discount, he actually made a profit. However, the question asks how much money he was out, which in this case is negative (he gained money).

   $90 (total cost) - $200 (amount received from selling) = -$110

Since the question asks for the amount of money he was out, and he actually gained money, the answer is that he was not out any money, but rather gained $110. However, if we strictly follow the question and provide a positive value for the amount he was out, we would say he was out $0.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time for each part of James's journey.

1. **Swimming the first part:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - 60% of 20 miles is 0.60 * 20 = 12 miles.
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - The time to swim 12 miles is 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

2. **Resting on the island:**
   - James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   - The rest time is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

3. **Swimming the remaining part:**
   - The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.
   - The time to swim 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

4. **Total time:**
   - The total time is the sum of the time spent swimming the first part, resting, and swimming the remaining part.
   - Total time = 6 hours (first part) + 3 hours (rest) + 8 hours (remaining part) = 17 hours.

- The commission rate is 10%.
- The commission per copy is $5 * 10% = $0.50.
- For 6 copies, the total commission is 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Each copy costs $15.
- The commission rate is 8%.
- The commission per copy is $15 * 8% = $1.20.
- For 10 copies, the total commission is 10 * $1.20 = $12.00.

Adding the commissions from both newspapers:
- Total commission = $3.00 (New York Times) + $12.00 (Wall Street Journal) = $15.00.

The final numerical answer is:
15.00"
"To find Leo's age, we first need to determine Marcus's age. We know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, who is 26 years old.

So, Marcus's age is:
26 - 5 = 21 years old

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo’s age. Therefore, to find Leo's age, we multiply Marcus's age by 2:

21 * 2 = 42 years old

Leo is 42 years old.

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati as B, by Azibo as A, and by Dinar as D. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. B + A + D = 45 (the total points scored by the team)
2. B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
3. B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

From the second equation, we can express A in terms of B: A = B - 20.
From the third equation, we can express D in terms of B: D = B - 10.

Now we can substitute A and D in the first equation with their expressions in terms of B:

B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45
3B - 30 = 45
3B = 75
B = 25

Now that we know B (Bahati's score), we can find A (Azibo's score):

A = B - 20
A = 25 - 20
A = 5

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To find the total number of pages in the book, we can use the information that there are 100 pages per inch and the book is 1.5 inches thick.

First, we calculate the number of pages per inch and then multiply by the thickness of the book in inches:

100 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 150 pages

However, since each sheet of paper has printing on both sides, each sheet counts as two pages. The calculation above already takes this into account, as it is based on the number of pages, not sheets.

Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is 150.

"To determine how many reports Vince can staple from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Vince spends stapling reports.
2. Convert the total time into 15-minute intervals.
3. Multiply the number of 15-minute intervals by the number of reports Vince can staple in each interval.

First, let's calculate the total time Vince spends stapling:

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Now, convert 15 hours into minutes:

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Next, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:

900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals

Finally, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports Vince can staple in each interval:

60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports

So, Vince can staple 1800 reports altogether.

"Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours or 480 minutes. On the day in question, she was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes. She also woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so instead of waking up at 6 a.m., she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

To calculate the total sleep time, we need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early from her usual sleep time.

480 minutes (usual sleep time) - 23 minutes (sleepwalking) - 5 minutes (woke up early) = 452 minutes.

"First, let's determine how many measuring spoons Jonathan has. If he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen (24) measuring cups, then the number of measuring spoons is:

\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Now, if Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ \text{Measuring spoons remaining} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ \text{Total utensils remaining} = 24 \text{ (measuring cups)} + 10 \text{ (measuring spoons)} = 34 \]

"The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied. This means that:

1000 beds * 1/5 = 200 beds are occupied.

The number of unoccupied beds at the start is:

1000 beds - 200 beds = 800 beds.

If 50 patients are admitted each day, over the course of 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted will be:

50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients.

The total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks will be the initial unoccupied beds minus the number of patients admitted:

800 beds - 700 patients = 100 beds.

"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of non-work emails: Since Robyn sends 16 emails a day and 7 are work emails, the remainder is 16 - 7 = 9 emails.
2. Calculate the number of emails to family: Two-thirds of the 9 non-work emails are to family, so (2/3) * 9 = 6 emails.
3. Calculate the number of emails to her boyfriend: One-third of the remaining emails (after work and family) are to her boyfriend. There are 9 - 6 = 3 emails left, and one-third of these is (1/3) * 3 = 1 email.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"To find out how old Shawna's father is, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Shawna's age based on Aliya's age.
2. Calculate Shawna's father's age based on Shawna's age.

Given that Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years old

Now, since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we can calculate his age as follows:

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years old

So, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

"If Courtney reported that the audience was 48 in number but overstated this number by 20%, we can find the actual number of people who attended the concert by calculating what 100% (the actual number) would be.

Let's denote the actual number of people as \( x \). According to the information, Courtney's count of 48 is 120% of the actual number, because she overstated by 20%.

So we have the equation:

\[ 1.20 \times x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

The total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to first determine the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day, and then use the information that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day.

Let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:

- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes, but they filled in 2, so the net holes dug on the third day is 8 - 2 = 6 holes

Total holes by the end of the third day: 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes

Now, we know that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes, so four times that is:

4 * 10 = 40 holes

This means that by the end of the fourth day, there were 40 holes in total. Since there were 29 holes by the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:

40 (total holes by the end of the fourth day) - 29 (holes by the end of the third day) = 11 holes

So, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

"The cost of the travel tickets is 50% more than the cost of the supplies. If the supplies cost $400, then the additional cost for the tickets is 50% of $400, which is:

0.50 * $400 = $200

So, the total cost for the travel tickets is the cost of the supplies plus the additional 50%:

$400 + $200 = $600

The travel cost is $600."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

Let A represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught,
Let S represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught,
Let W represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. A + S + W = 339 (Together they have caught 339 Pokemon)
2. A = S + 5 (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)
3. S = 4W - 13 (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to eliminate A:

(S + 5) + S + W = 339
2S + W + 5 = 339
2S + W = 334  (Equation 4)

Now we can substitute the third equation into Equation 4 to eliminate S:

2(4W - 13) + W = 334
8W - 26 + W = 334
9W - 26 = 334
9W = 360
W = 40

Now that we have W, we can find S:

S = 4W - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to determine the total number of episodes and then multiply that by the length of each episode.

We know that each episode is 20 minutes long and that there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. This means that the number of episodes is 20 / 2, which is 10 episodes.

Now, to find the total time spent watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

10 episodes * 20 minutes/episode = 200 minutes

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode.

"To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance the bird traveled in each direction and then sum the distances traveled to the south, subtracting the distance traveled to the north.

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 30 mph * 10 hours = 300 miles

2. The bird then flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 18 mph * 2 hours = 36 miles

3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 22 mph * 5 hours = 110 miles

Now, we add the distances traveled to the south and subtract the distance traveled to the north to find the total distance between the two homes:

Total distance = (Distance south 1 + Distance south 2) - Distance north
Total distance = (300 miles + 110 miles) - 36 miles
Total distance = 410 miles - 36 miles
Total distance = 374 miles

"To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she had and then subtract the number of brownies that were eaten.

1. Greta made a batch of 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself.
2. She was sent home with 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office party.
3. Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies for the surprise party.
4. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.

First, we convert all the dozens to individual brownies:
- 1 dozen = 12 brownies
- 1/2 dozen = 6 brownies
- 4 dozen = 48 brownies
- 1 1/2 dozen = 18 brownies

Now, we add up all the brownies she had:
- 12 (from herself) + 6 (from the office) + 48 (from the surprise party) = 66 brownies

Then, we subtract the brownies that were eaten:
- 66 (total brownies) - 18 (eaten) = 48 brownies

So, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.

"Nani's age is 8 years. His brother is twice his age, which means his brother is 16 years old. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. To find her age, we calculate 75% of 8 years:

\[ \text{Sister's age} = 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \text{ years} \]

Now, to find the total age of all three family members, we add their ages together:

\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Nani's age} + \text{Brother's age} + \text{Sister's age} \]
\[ \text{Total age} = 8 + 16 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Total age} = 30 \]

For the polyester string racquets:
5 racquets * 22 minutes per racquet = 110 minutes

For the hybrid set racquets:
4 racquets * 18 minutes per racquet = 72 minutes

Number of players on Zeke's team = Number of players on Carlton's team + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

"To find out how many wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:

P = 2 * (length + width)

Given that the length (L) is 15 feet and the width (W) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2 * (15 + 10)
P = 2 * 25
P = 50 feet

Now that we know the perimeter is 50 feet, and Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we can calculate the total number of wood slats (S) he will need:

S = P * 2
S = 50 * 2
S = 100

Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the width of the flowers from inches to feet.
2. Calculate the total space each plant, including the space between them, will occupy.
3. Determine how many plants can fit in the flower bed.
4. Subtract the number of plants Pat already owns from the total number of plants needed.
5. Calculate the cost of the additional plants needed.

Let's start with step 1:
- Each flower grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot (since 12 inches = 1 foot).

Step 2:
- Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between them, so the total space each plant will occupy is 1 foot (the plant itself) + 1.5 feet (the space between plants) = 2.5 feet.

Step 3:
- The flower bed is 111 feet long. To find out how many plants can fit, we divide the length of the flower bed by the total space each plant occupies: 111 feet / 2.5 feet per plant = 44.4 plants.
- Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

Step 4:
- Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional plants needed is 44 - 17 = 27 plants.

Step 5:
- Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for 27 plants is 27 plants * $6 per plant = $162.

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

$9.00 (petunias) + $5.00 (sweet potato vines) = $14.00

Now, to find the total cost for all 5 baskets, we multiply the cost of one basket by the number of baskets:
$14.00 per basket * 5 baskets = $70.00

So, the total amount Katherine will spend is:
$70.00

"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations, and then see how much soil is left for the roses.

First, let's calculate the soil used for the sunflowers:
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

Next, the soil used for the carnations:
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, let's add the soil used for sunflowers and carnations:
12 pounds (sunflowers) + 15 pounds (carnations) = 27 pounds

The total amount of soil they started with is 30 pounds, so the remaining soil for the roses is:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"Jessica sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck, which is:

$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00

She saves this amount each month, so in a year (12 months), she will have saved:

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of pairs she can buy with her savings is:

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

"To find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to calculate the time it takes for each task and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we divide the total number of shrimp by the rate at which she can peel them:

90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes to saute 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can find out how many minutes it takes to saute 90 shrimp by dividing the total number of shrimp by the number of shrimp she can saute in 10 minutes and then multiplying by 10:

(90 shrimp / 30 shrimp) * 10 minutes = 3 * 10 minutes = 30 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the shrimp and the time it takes to saute them:

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (sauteing) = 45 minutes

So, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature change for each period the air conditioner was running and when it was off.

1. On low for 3 hours: The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees per hour, so over 3 hours it will cool the room by 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.
2. On high for 4 hours: The air conditioner cools the room 3 degrees per hour, so over 4 hours it will cool the room by 3 * 4 = 12 degrees.
3. Off for 2 hours: The room will warm up 2 degrees per hour, so over 2 hours it will warm up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

Now, we can calculate the total temperature change by adding the cooling and subtracting the warming:

Total cooling = 6 degrees (low) + 12 degrees (high) = 18 degrees
Total warming = 4 degrees

Net temperature change = Total cooling - Total warming = 18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Bill's dad saw Comet Halley when he was 30 years old.
2. Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the next time the comet would be visible would be 75 years after the dad saw it.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. So, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet the second time.
4. Since the comet appears every 75 years, and Bill saw it when he was 90, the first time he saw the comet would have been 75 years earlier, when he was 90 - 75 = 15 years old.

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to add up the checks he writes for each of his expenses:

- Electric bill: 1 check per month × 12 months = 12 checks per year
- Gas bill: 1 check per month × 12 months = 12 checks per year
- Church: 2 checks per month × 12 months = 24 checks per year
- Pest and lawn service: 1 check per quarter × 4 quarters = 4 checks per year

Now, we add them all up:

12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks per year

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day be \( F \).
2. The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).
3. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France and the number of flights to Germany are each \( \frac{1}{8}F \) (since \( 1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \) and \( \frac{1}{4} \) is split equally between two destinations, so \( \frac{1}{4} \div 2 = \frac{1}{8} \)).

4. The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes is twice the number of flights the second plane makes:
   \[ F = 2 \times 44 \]
   \[ F = 88 \]

5. Now we can calculate the number of flights to France:
   \[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8}F \]
   \[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 \]
   \[ \text{Flights to France} = 11 \]

So, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day.

"To find the combined length of time the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum them up.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add up the durations of their howls:
20 (Tobias) + 40 (Chikote) + 60 (Igneous) = 120 seconds.

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert the total seconds to minutes:
120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.

"Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: \( A = 3 \) years
- Alessandro: \( L = 4 \) years
- Helene: \( H \) years
- Wilfred: \( W \) years

The total age of the children is given as 20 years, so we can write the equation:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known ages of Akbar and Alessandro, we get:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

We are also told that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So the average age is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we have:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 \]
\[ H = 10 \]

Now we can substitute Helene's age into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 13 - 10 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

So, Wilfred is 3 years old.

"To find out how many people were in the church next door, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests.
2. Determine how many cookies were given to the church.
3. Calculate how many people in the church received 15 cookies each.

Step 1: Total number of cookies brought by the guests
There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies.
Total cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

Step 2: Number of cookies given to the church
The bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church.
Cookies given to the church = 1/2 * 1500 cookies = 750 cookies

Step 3: Number of people in the church who received 15 cookies each
Each person in the church received 15 cookies.
Number of people = 750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

So, 50 people were in the church next door.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a ratio to represent the distribution of the watermelon slices. Let's say each kid's slice is represented by 1 unit. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be 2 units.

There are 4 kids and 2 adults, so the total number of units is:
4 kids * 1 unit/kid + 2 adults * 2 units/adult = 4 units + 4 units = 8 units

The watermelon is divided into 8 units in total. Each adult gets 2 units out of these 8 units. To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we can use the following formula:

(Units per adult / Total units) * 100%

So for each adult, the percentage is:
(2 units / 8 units) * 100% = 0.25 * 100% = 25%

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he will spend on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from his total available time at the clinic.

First, let's calculate the time spent on rounds:
- Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients.
- Each inpatient check takes 20 minutes.
- Total time for rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on appointments:
- Doctor Jones has 10 appointments.
- Each appointment takes 30 minutes.
- Total time for appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.

Now, let's convert the total time for rounds and appointments into hours:
- Total time for rounds in hours = 180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours.
- Total time for appointments in hours = 300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours.

Now, let's add the time spent on rounds and appointments to find the total time spent:
- Total time spent = 3 hours (rounds) + 5 hours (appointments) = 8 hours.

Finally, let's subtract the total time spent from the total available time to find the time left for updating records:
- Time left for updating records = 9 hours (total available) - 8 hours (spent) = 1 hour.

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up all the time required for each step and then subtract that total from the time she wants to serve the cake.

The total time required is:
- 20 minutes to make the cake batter
- 30 minutes to bake the cake
- 2 hours to cool the cake
- 10 minutes to frost the cake

Let's convert all the times to minutes for easier calculation:
- 20 minutes (batter)
- 30 minutes (baking)
- 2 hours = 120 minutes (cooling)
- 10 minutes (frosting)

Now, let's add up the total time in minutes:
20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours.

Jordan wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm. To find the latest time she can start, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as \( x \).

Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold \( 64 \) chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:

\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by \( 8 \):

\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]

\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the following:

1. The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
2. The cost per student per session is $1.50.
3. There are 10 students.
4. The studio is rented 3 days a week.

First, we calculate the total cost per session:
- Studio rental cost per session: $25
- Cost per student per session: $1.50 * 10 students = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40

Next, we calculate the total cost per week:
- Total cost per session * 3 sessions per week = $40 * 3 = $120

Now, we need to determine the number of weeks in a month. For simplicity, we'll assume an average month has about 4 weeks.

Finally, we calculate the total cost per month:
- Total cost per week * 4 weeks = $120 * 4 = $480

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month would be the total cost, which is the amount the studio would need to cover. However, if you are asking for the revenue (which is the amount the studio would collect from the students), we need to calculate the total revenue from the students and then subtract the studio rental costs.

Revenue from students per session:
- $1.50 * 10 students = $15

Total revenue from students per week:
- $15 * 3 sessions = $45

Total revenue from students per month:
- $45 * 4 weeks = $180

Total revenue (earnings) per month:
- Revenue from students - Studio rental costs = $180 - $480 = -$300

However, since the question asks for the expected earnings, and typically earnings refer to the total amount of money coming in (revenue), the expected earnings (revenue) of the dance studio in a month would be the total amount collected from the students, which is $180.

If the question is asking for the profit, which is the earnings after costs, then the studio would be at a loss of $300.

Since the question is not specific about whether it's asking for revenue or profit, I'll provide the revenue as the expected earnings:

"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we need to first determine how many chocolate bars are in each of their boxes.

Let's start with Peter. If Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars, we can find the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:

Number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes = Total chocolate bars / Number of boxes
Number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes = 64 / 4
Number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes = 16

Now, let's do the same for Martha. If Martha has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars, we can find the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes by dividing her total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:

Number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes = Total chocolate bars / Number of boxes
Number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes = 56 / 7
Number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes = 8

Now we can find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha by subtracting the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes:

More chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes = Number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes - Number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes
More chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes = 16 - 8
More chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes = 8

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"To find out how many porcupines will be in the park after a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of female porcupines.
2. Determine the number of babies born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of babies born in a year.
4. Add the total number of babies born in a year to the initial population to get the final population.

Step 1: Calculate the number of female porcupines.
The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population.
Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Step 2: Determine the number of babies born each month.
Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
Babies born each month = Number of female porcupines * 4 = 30 * 4 = 120

Step 3: Calculate the total number of babies born in a year.
There are 12 months in a year.
Total babies born in a year = Babies born each month * 12 = 120 * 12 = 1440

Step 4: Add the total number of babies born in a year to the initial population.
Final population = Initial population + Total babies born in a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons using the given conversion factor.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons and the cost per gallon.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.
The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume (V) can be calculated using the formula:
V = length × width × depth

V = 25 feet × 14 feet × 4 feet
V = 1400 cubic feet

Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.
We are given that the volume in cubic feet should be multiplied by 5.9 to get the volume in gallons.

Gallons = 1400 cubic feet × 5.9 gallons/cubic foot
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Step 3: Calculate the cost.
The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon.

Cost = 8260 gallons × $0.10/gallon
Cost = $826

The cost to fill the pool is $826.

"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each of them traveled and then subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance.

The formula to calculate distance is:
Distance = Speed × Time

For Matteo:
Distance_Matteo = Speed_Matteo × Time_Matteo
Distance_Matteo = 55 mph × 4 hours
Distance_Matteo = 220 miles

For Shandy:
Distance_Shandy = Speed_Shandy × Time_Shandy
Distance_Shandy = 45 mph × 10 hours
Distance_Shandy = 450 miles

Now, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove:
Distance_Shandy - Distance_Matteo = 450 miles - 220 miles
Distance_Shandy - Distance_Matteo = 230 miles

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps in one hour.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps in one hour.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps in one hour.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

10 (Bethany's laps) - 5 (Quinn's laps) = 5

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water pumped into the tank on both days and then subtract that from the tank's total capacity to find out how much water is remaining.

First, let's calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:

- Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity on the first day:
  \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons

- Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda on the first day:
  \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons

Now, let's calculate the amount of water they pumped on the second day:

- Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day:
  \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons

- Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day:
  \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons

Now, let's add up all the water pumped into the tank over the two days:

- Total water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on the first day:
  \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons

- Total water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on the second day:
  \( 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \) gallons

- Total water pumped into the tank over the two days:
  \( 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \) gallons

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity to find out how much water is remaining:

- Water remaining to fill the tank:
  \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons

So, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is:

"To find out the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

First, we need to account for the 3 hours where the power bank was losing 7% of its total capacity each hour. If the power bank lost 7% per hour, then each hour it retained 93% (100% - 7%) of its charge. To find the charge before these 3 hours, we can divide the final charge by 0.93 three times (once for each hour).

Let's calculate the charge before the last 3 hours:

28% / 0.93 = 30.11% (after 2 hours of 7% loss)
30.11% / 0.93 = 32.37% (after 1 hour of 7% loss)
32.37% / 0.93 = 34.80% (initial charge before 7% loss started)

Next, we need to account for the 5 hours where the power bank was losing 9% of its total capacity each hour. If the power bank lost 9% per hour, then each hour it retained 91% (100% - 9%) of its charge. To find the charge before these 5 hours, we can divide the charge we just calculated by 0.91 five times (once for each hour).

Let's calculate the charge before the first 5 hours:

34.80% / 0.91 = 38.24% (after 4 hours of 9% loss)
38.24% / 0.91 = 42.02% (after 3 hours of 9% loss)
42.02% / 0.91 = 46.18% (after 2 hours of 9% loss)
46.18% / 0.91 = 50.75% (after 1 hour of 9% loss)
50.75% / 0.91 = 55.77% (initial charge before 9% loss started)

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 55.77%.

"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to save, which is 20% of $10,000.

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Next, we need to determine how much Janet earns in a week. She makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, which totals to $25 an hour.

$10 (wages) + $15 (tips) = $25 per hour

Since she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

$25 per hour * 40 hours = $1,000 per week

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for her to save $2,000, which is the amount needed for the down payment.

$2,000 (total needed) / $1,000 (weekly earnings) = 2 weeks

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save up the down payment for the car.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: 3 * $0.50 = $1.50
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: 4 * $0.50 = $2.00
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up these costs to find the total amount spent so far:

Total spent = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he has to spend on plums is:

Remaining money = $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can calculate how many plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining money:

Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, each friend will receive 1.3 * 60 = 78 pieces of sweets.

"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

Final Price = Initial Price * (1 + Rate of Increase) ^ Number of Years

In this case:
- Initial Price = $120
- Rate of Increase = 5% = 0.05
- Number of Years = 3

Let's calculate the final price:

Final Price = 120 * (1 + 0.05) ^ 3
Final Price = 120 * (1.05) ^ 3
Final Price = 120 * 1.157625
Final Price = 138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the final price is:

"To find out how many portraits and selfies Olivia had, we need to determine how many pictures were in each album and then multiply that number by the number of albums for selfies and portraits.

First, we find out how many pictures are in each album:
72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Next, we calculate the number of selfies:
3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies

Then, we calculate the number of portraits:
2 albums * 9 pictures per album = 18 portraits

Finally, we add the number of selfies and portraits together to get the total:
27 selfies + 18 portraits = 45 pictures

"To find out how many guests the hotel now has, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform the necessary calculations.

1. The hotel started with 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so we subtract 24 from 100:
   100 - 24 = 76 guests remaining.
3. 15 guests checked out late, so we subtract 15 from the remaining 76:
   76 - 15 = 61 guests remaining.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice that number checked in:
   2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in.
5. We add the 30 guests who checked in to the 61 guests remaining:
   61 + 30 = 91 guests.
6. After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so we add 7 to the 91 guests:
   91 + 7 = 98 guests.

The hotel now has 98 guests.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions.
2. Calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get right in each category.
3. Sum the number of questions Aries is sure to get right to find the total points.

Step 1: Calculate the number of questions in each category.
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24 questions
- The remaining 60% of the questions are divided equally between average and difficult questions.
- Average questions: 30% of 60 = 0.30 * 60 = 18 questions
- Difficult questions: 30% of 60 = 0.30 * 60 = 18 questions

Step 2: Calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get right.
- Easy questions: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions
- Average questions: 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9 questions
- Difficult questions: 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9 questions

Step 3: Sum the number of questions Aries is sure to get right.

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( x \). Then the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \) because she sold twice as many small ones as large ones.

The total earnings from the sales of the small stuffed animals is \( 2x \times S \) and from the large stuffed animals is \( x \times L \). The total earnings are given as $120.

So we can write the equation for the total earnings as:
\[ 2x \times S + x \times L = 120 \]

Substituting the values of \( S \) and \( L \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 2x \times 4 + x \times 12 = 120 \]
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \), which is:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in a day, and then multiply that by the number of dwarves and the number of days in the month.

1. First, we find out how much a dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe:
   - A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so:
     12 pounds/day * 2 = 24 pounds/day

2. Next, we calculate how much a dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe:
   - A steel pickaxe allows a dwarf to mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so:
     24 pounds/day * 1.5 = 36 pounds/day

3. Now, we calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves in one day with steel pickaxes:
   - 40 dwarves * 36 pounds/day = 1440 pounds/day

4. Finally, we find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days:
   - 1440 pounds/day * 30 days = 43200 pounds

"To find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can use the information that the prices are proportional. This means that the cost per sandwich is the same for all package sizes.

First, we calculate the cost per sandwich for the first two packages:

- For the first package, the cost per sandwich is $3 / 2 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich.
- For the second package, the cost per sandwich is $6 / 4 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich.

Since the cost per sandwich is the same for both packages, we can use this cost to find the price of the third package:

- For the third package, the cost would be 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12.

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sally starts with 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons.
2. 40% of the red balloons burst, so she loses 40% of 25, which is 10 red balloons. She now has 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.
3. She accidentally releases half of the yellow balloons, so she loses 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. She now has 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.
4. She finds 8 blue balloons and adds 75% of them to her clutch. 75% of 8 is 6, so she adds 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's add up the remaining balloons:

- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7 (none were lost or added)
- Yellow balloons: 6
- Blue balloons: 6 (added to her clutch)

Total balloons Sally carries into the school:

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios where he would not have to turn it in and then subtract that from 100%.

1. There's a 50% chance that Marcus will have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework.
2. If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. This means there's a 50% * 40% = 20% chance that the normal teacher will give an extension.
3. If the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension (50% * 60% = 30% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. This means there's a 30% * 20% = 6% chance that Marcus will get a personal extension.

Now, we add up all the probabilities where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
- 50% (substitute teacher)
- 20% (normal teacher gives an extension)
- 6% (Marcus gets a personal extension)

The total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework is 50% + 20% + 6% = 76%.

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is 100% - 76% = 24%.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats available for friends and family by subtracting the seats for graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.
2. Divide the number of seats available for friends and family by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.

Let's do the math:

Total seats available for friends and family = Total seats - (Seats for graduates + Seats for faculty)
Total seats available for friends and family = 6000 - (950 + 300)
Total seats available for friends and family = 6000 - 1250
Total seats available for friends and family = 4750

Now, we divide the number of seats available for friends and family by the number of graduates:

Tickets per graduate = Total seats available for friends and family / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

Each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to calculate her total earnings and subtract her total expenses, then divide that by the total number of hours she spent on jury duty.

First, let's calculate her total earnings:
Earnings per day = $15
Total earnings for 3 days = $15 * 3 = $45

Next, let's calculate her total expenses:
Parking cost per day = $3
Total parking cost for 3 days = $3 * 3 = $9

Now, we subtract her total expenses from her total earnings to find her net earnings:
Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = $45 - $9 = $36

Finally, we divide her net earnings by the total number of hours she spent on jury duty to find her pay per hour:
Total hours spent = 6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours
Pay per hour after expenses = Net earnings / Total hours spent
Pay per hour after expenses = $36 / 18 hours = $2

So, Melissa makes $2 per hour after expenses.

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the number of soda bottles he will place and the time it will take to move between them.

First, we calculate the number of soda bottles. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of bottles is:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

However, since he starts at the first bottle, he will only need to move between the bottles, which means he will move 7 times (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, until the 7th to the 8th).

It takes Richard 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. Therefore, the total time to move between all the bottles is:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Since the question asks for the total time to set off all the soda fountains, and we assume that the time to drop the candy into the bottle is negligible or included in the 5 seconds of movement, the total time is 35 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Jim's education, including the loans and the income he did not earn while in college. Then we need to determine how long it will take for him to earn that amount with his new, higher salary.

1. Calculate the total amount of loans:
   $50,000 per year * 4 years = $200,000

2. Calculate the income not earned while in college:
   $25,000 per year * 4 years = $100,000

3. Calculate the total cost of college:
   $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000

4. Calculate Jim's new income after college:
   $25,000 (old income) * 3 = $75,000 (new income)

5. Calculate the additional income per year after college:
   $75,000 (new income) - $25,000 (old income) = $50,000 (additional income per year)

6. Calculate how long it will take to earn the equivalent of the total cost of college:
   $300,000 (total cost) / $50,000 (additional income per year) = 6 years

So, it will take Jim 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To find out how much fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he will be using. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet, and Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of the fabric piece will be:
6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of the fabric piece will be:
8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we can calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
8 feet (length) * 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. On the first race, he lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 on the first race, twice that amount is $10, and $1 more than that is $11. So, he won $11 on the second race.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 on the second race, 1.5 times that amount is $16.50. So, he lost $16.50 on the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost and the average loss per race.

Total amount lost = Amount lost in the first race + Amount lost in the third race
Total amount lost = $5 + $16.50
Total amount lost = $21.50

Since he won $11 on the second race, we need to subtract that from the total amount lost to get the net loss for the day.
Net loss for the day = Total amount lost - Amount won in the second race
Net loss for the day = $21.50 - $11
Net loss for the day = $10.50

Now, to find the average loss per race, we divide the net loss by the number of races.
Average loss per race = Net loss for the day / Number of races
Average loss per race = $10.50 / 3
Average loss per race = $3.50

The average loss per race is $3.50.

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:

"To find out how many hours of work each painter put in, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide that by the number of painters.

First, we need to determine how many days the painters worked. Since they worked for 3 weeks and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days is:

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Next, we calculate the fraction of a day they worked each day, which is 3/8 of a day. To find out the total fraction of days worked over the 3 weeks, we multiply the number of days by the fraction of the day they worked:

21 days * 3/8 = 63/8 days

Since a full day is 24 hours, we convert the total fraction of days worked into hours:

63/8 days * 24 hours/day = 189 hours

This is the total number of hours worked by the entire team. To find out how many hours each painter worked, we divide the total hours by the number of painters, which is 4:

189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours

Each painter put in 47.25 hours of work.

"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \). According to the problem:

- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the second set, Rory retrieved \( x \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19, so we can write the equation:

\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms and solve the equation:

\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:

\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we have \( x \), the number of balls retrieved in the second set, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set of the match.

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train, so the new total is:
   120 + 20 = 140 people.
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend and twice that number (100 people) board the train, so the new total is:
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190 people.
4. At the third stop, 80 people descend, so the new total is:
   190 - 80 = 110 people.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."

"To calculate the cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to determine how many tiles are required to cover the entire area and then multiply that by the cost per tile.

1. First, we find out how many tiles are needed. Since each tile is 1 square foot (1ft x 1ft), and the kitchen floor is 200 square feet, we need 200 tiles to cover the entire floor.

2. Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost per tile. If each tile costs $12, then the total cost is 200 tiles * $12/tile.

200 * 12 = $2400

So, the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400.

"James pays 60% more than the normal cost of $120 a month due to his accident. First, we calculate the additional cost per month:

60% of $120 = 0.60 * $120 = $72

So, the new monthly cost is:

$120 + $72 = $192

To find out how much he pays a year, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):

$192 * 12 = $2304

"To determine the number of laundry loads Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the weekly loads and then multiply by the number of weeks in a year.

Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed. The laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time.

For the twin beds:
- He has 4 twin beds, and the machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, so he needs 4 / 2 = 2 loads for the twin beds.

For the king size bed:
- He has 1 king size bed, and the machine can wash 1 king set at a time, so he needs 1 load for the king size bed.

In total, each week he does 2 (for twin beds) + 1 (for the king bed) = 3 loads of laundry.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads in a year is 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

"To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to calculate the total amount of food the cats consume in one day and then divide the total amount of food Imma has by the daily consumption.

Each feeding, the 3 cats together consume 60 grams of cat food. Since they are fed twice a day, the total daily consumption is:

60 grams/feeding * 2 feedings/day = 120 grams/day

Now, we divide the total amount of food Imma has by the daily consumption to find out how many days it will last:

720 grams / 120 grams/day = 6 days

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 6 days.

"Let's denote the time Donovan took to make his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's time as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal is the sum of the time Betsy and Donovan each took, which is 98 minutes. So we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Solving for \( D \):

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]
\[ 2D = 98 - 18 \]
\[ 2D = 80 \]
\[ D = 40 \]

Now that we know Donovan's part took 40 minutes, we can find out how long Betsy's part took:

\[ Betsy's\ part = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

So, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pizzas each group ate and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas they ordered to find out how many are left.

First, let's calculate the number of pizzas the glee club ate:
- The glee club ordered 20 pizzas.
- They ate 70% of them, which is 0.70 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

Now, let's find out how many pizzas the glee club has left:
- They started with 20 pizzas and ate 14, so 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas are left.

Next, we'll calculate the number of pizzas the football team ate:
- The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.
- They ate 80% of them, which is 0.80 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

Now, let's find out how many pizzas the football team has left:
- They started with 40 pizzas and ate 32, so 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas are left.

Finally, we'll add the remaining pizzas from both groups to find the total number of pizzas left:

"To find out how much Anthony spends on postage, we need to calculate the cost for both the small and big coupons and then add them together.

First, we calculate the number of big coupons:
- Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, so he will send out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons.

Next, we calculate the cost for the small coupons:
- Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

Then, we calculate the cost for the big coupons:
- Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

Finally, we add the costs together to get the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of small coupons + cost of big coupons = 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:
- Total cost in dollars = 24500 cents / 100 = $245.

2. Next, we find out how many trucks were able to deliver the fertiliser:
   \[ \text{Number of trucks that delivered} = 20 - 5 = 15 \]

3. Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, so the total amount of fertiliser delivered is:

The promotion at the grocery store is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter Dennis buys at full price, he gets the next pound at half price.

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. For the first pound, he pays $4.00, and for the second pound, he pays $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00. Therefore, for every two pounds, he pays $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds, he will have 3 sets of two pounds. The total cost for 6 pounds of butter will be 3 sets * $6.00 per set = $18.00.

Additional guests = Total attending - 20 = 41 - 20 = 21 people

The cost for each additional guest is $6, so the additional cost will be:
Additional cost = 21 * 6 = $126

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the party:
Total cost = Base fee + Additional cost = $125 + $126 = $251

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bananas eaten by the first monkey in a week.
2. Calculate the total number of bananas eaten by the second monkey in a week.
3. Subtract the total eaten by the first and second monkeys from the total number of bananas to find out how many the third monkey eats in a week.
4. Divide the weekly amount eaten by the third monkey by 7 to find the daily amount.

Let's do the calculations:

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day, so in a week (7 days), the first monkey eats:
   10 bananas/day * 7 days/week = 70 bananas/week

2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day, so the second monkey eats:
   (10 bananas/day + 4 bananas/day) * 7 days/week = 14 bananas/day * 7 days/week = 98 bananas/week

3. The total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week is:
   70 bananas/week + 98 bananas/week = 168 bananas/week

4. The total number of bananas Mr. Robles buys is 315, so the third monkey eats the rest:
   315 bananas - 168 bananas = 147 bananas/week

5. To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the weekly amount by 7:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses Jenny bought and then determine how much change she should receive in quarters.

First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since a dozen (12) roses cost $15, we can find the cost of 15 roses by calculating the cost of 12 roses and the cost of the remaining 3 roses.

Cost of 12 roses: $15
Cost of 3 roses: 3 * $2 = $6

Total cost of 15 roses: $15 + $6 = $21

Jenny arrived with five 5 dollar bills, which means she had a total of:

5 * $5 = $25

Now, we subtract the total cost of the roses from the amount of money Jenny had:

$25 - $21 = $4

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:

$4 * 4 quarters/dollar = 16 quarters

Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend paid for the watch.
3. Determine the discount Mr. Rogers' friend received from the original price.
4. Calculate the percentage discount based on the original price.

Step 1: Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price.
Original price of the watch = $2000
Price Mr. Rogers paid = 75% of $2000 = 0.75 * $2000 = $1500

Step 2: Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he paid.
Price Mr. Rogers' friend paid = 120% of $1500 = 1.20 * $1500 = $1800

"To find out how much Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the cost of the bananas both ways and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Each banana costs $0.80.
- Jenny bought 10 bunches, with each bunch averaging 4 bananas.
- So, the total number of bananas is 10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas.
- The cost of 40 bananas at $0.80 each is 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Each bunch costs $3.00.
- Jenny bought 10 bunches, so the total cost is 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00.

Finally, we find the savings by subtracting the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

According to the problem, we have two equations:

1. \( S + H = 100 \) (the total amount of fence)
2. \( H = S + 60 \) (Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( S \):

\( S + (S + 60) = 100 \)

Combine like terms:

\( 2S + 60 = 100 \)

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\( 2S = 40 \)

Divide by 2:

\( S = 20 \)

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply by their respective prices.

First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes sold: 50% of 300 = 0.5 * 300 = 150
- BMX bikes sold: 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
- MTB bikes sold: The rest of the bikes, so 300 - (150 + 45) = 300 - 195 = 105

Now, let's calculate the earnings from each type of bike:

- Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * ($500 / 2) = 45 * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

Finally, we add up the earnings from all types of bikes to get the total earnings:

"First, let's calculate the total number of periods John has in a day, including the extra classes:

6 normal periods + 2 extra classes = 8 periods per day

Each period is 40 minutes long, so the total minutes spent in class each day is:

8 periods/day * 40 minutes/period = 320 minutes/day

John goes to class for 5 days a week, so the total minutes spent in class each week is:

320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes/week

John also spends 1/16 of his weekly class time on Saturday and Sunday. So, the extra learning time for each of these days is:

1600 minutes/week * 1/16 = 100 minutes/day

Since he does this on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:

100 minutes/day * 2 days = 200 minutes

Now, let's add the extra learning time to the weekly class time to get the total weekly learning time:

1600 minutes/week + 200 minutes = 1800 minutes/week

To convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

1800 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 30 hours/week

So, John spends 30 hours a week learning.

"To find the height of the fourth child in inches, we need to follow the information given step by step:

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.
2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.
3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.
4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The height of the fourth child is 72 inches.

"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to calculate the number of bags sold and then multiply that by the price per bag.

First, we determine the number of bags sold:
2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Next, we calculate the earnings:
200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

So, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat left, because the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex.

2. The 540 kilograms is what was left after the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. So, before the T-Rex ate, there were 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops.

Therefore, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

"To calculate the cost to paint the room, we need to determine the total area of the walls and then figure out how many gallons of paint are required.

First, let's calculate the area of each pair of walls:

- The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide by 8 feet high, so the area of one wall is 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the north and south walls is 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.
- The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide by 8 feet high, so the area of one wall is 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the east and west walls is 40 * 2 = 80 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all four walls to get the total area to be painted:

Total area = 160 + 80 = 240 square feet

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, we divide the total area by the coverage per gallon:

Gallons needed = Total area / Coverage per gallon = 240 / 20 = 12 gallons

Finally, we calculate the cost by multiplying the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:

Cost = Gallons needed * Cost per gallon = 12 * 12 = $144

The cost to paint the room is $144.

"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of picking a shaken soda from the remaining sodas.

Initially, there are 12 sodas in total, with 3 of them being shaken. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda, leaving 11 sodas (3 shaken and 8 unshaken). Ellen's brother then takes 1 shaken and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 10 sodas in total (2 shaken and 8 unshaken - 2 = 6 unshaken).

Now, there are 10 sodas left, with 2 of them being shaken. The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left:

Probability = Number of shaken sodas / Total number of sodas left
Probability = 2 / 10
Probability = 1 / 5

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Percentage = (1 / 5) * 100
Percentage = 20%

"The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the second train is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour. Since they are traveling in opposite directions, their speeds add up when calculating the distance between them.

The distance the first train travels in 3 hours is:
60 miles/hour * 3 hours = 180 miles

The distance the second train travels in 3 hours is:
30 miles/hour * 3 hours = 90 miles

The total distance between the two trains after 3 hours is the sum of the distances they have each traveled:
180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy takes off (20% of the total days).
3. Calculate the number of days Billy works.
4. Calculate the number of people Billy helps per day.
5. Multiply the number of people helped per day by the number of days he works to get the total number of people helped.

Let's start with step 1:

- March has 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.
- Total days between March 1st and April 19th = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

Step 2:

- Billy takes 20% of the days off.
- 20% of 50 days = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.

Step 3:

- Total days Billy works = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Step 4:

- Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day.
- People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.

Step 5:

- Total people helped = People helped per day * Number of days worked = 6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many people were inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the cars and buses could carry.

First, we calculate the number of people the buses could carry:
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, we calculate the number of people the cars could carry:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, we add the two numbers together to get the total number of people:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Therefore, the total number of people who could have been inside the church is 480.

"To find out how old Jeff is, we can start by determining Martha's age. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4 years
Martha's age = 24 years - 4 years
Martha's age = 20 years

Now that we know Martha is 20 years old, we can find out Jeff's age. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10 years
Jeff's age = 20 years + 10 years
Jeff's age = 30 years

Jeff is 30 years old.

"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
Length = 300 feet
Speed = 60 feet/minute
Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
Length = 240 feet
Speed = 80 feet/minute
Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

The difference in time:
Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

We are told that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on, so we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 15:

\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

"To find Caroline's age, we first need to determine Ben's age based on Chris's age, and then use Ben's age to find Caroline's age.

Given that Chris is 4 years old and Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age as follows:
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben is 8 years old, and Caroline is three times older than Ben, we can calculate Caroline's age:
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

So, Caroline is 24 years old.

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work to save for a 20-year retirement, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount given her current savings rate.

1. Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs for retirement:
   40% of her current annual salary is $100,000 * 0.40 = $40,000 per year.

2. Calculate the total amount needed for 20 years of retirement:
   $40,000 per year * 20 years = $800,000.

3. Calculate the amount Lauren saves from each paycheck:
   She saves 20% of her current annual salary, which is $100,000 * 0.20 = $20,000 per year.

4. Determine how many years it will take to save the total amount needed:
   Total amount needed / Amount saved per year = $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for a 20-year retirement at 40% of her current annual salary.

"To find the length of each final cut, we first need to determine the length of each of the 4 equal parts Marty cuts from the 100 centimeters of ribbon. We do this by dividing the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts:

100 centimeters / 4 parts = 25 centimeters per part

Next, we need to divide each of these 25 centimeter parts into 5 equal parts. We do this by dividing the length of each part by 5:

25 centimeters / 5 parts = 5 centimeters per final cut

So, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the information that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. We can set up the equation:

40% * Total Students = 240 boys

To find the total number of students, we divide the number of boys by 40% (or 0.40):

Total Students = 240 boys / 0.40

Now we can calculate the total number of students:

Total Students = 240 / 0.40
Total Students = 600

Since 40% of the school population are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. We can now calculate the number of girls:

Number of Girls = 60% * Total Students
Number of Girls = 0.60 * 600
Number of Girls = 360

So, there are 360 girls in the school.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her 9,300-mile journey in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days in June.
2. Calculate the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike each day.
3. Calculate the total number of miles Soledad will hike in June based on her current plan.
4. Determine the difference between her goal and the total miles she will hike based on her current plan.
5. Calculate how many more miles per day she needs to hike to make up the difference.

Let's go through these steps:

1. June has 30 days.
2. Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.
3. Based on her current plan, she will hike 250 miles/day * 30 days = 7,500 miles in June.
4. The difference between her goal and her current plan is 9,300 miles - 7,500 miles = 1,800 miles.
5. To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we divide the difference by the number of days in June: 1,800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles per day.

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her 9,300-mile journey on time.

"To find out how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we need to calculate the distance for one round trip and then multiply it by the number of visits he makes in a month.

First, we calculate the distance for one way:
- Speed = 70 mph
- Time = 2 hours

Distance (one way) = Speed * Time
Distance (one way) = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance (one way) = 140 miles

Since this is a round trip, we need to double the distance for one way to get the total distance for a round trip:
Distance (round trip) = Distance (one way) * 2
Distance (round trip) = 140 miles * 2
Distance (round trip) = 280 miles

John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the round trip distance by the number of visits:
Distance (monthly) = Distance (round trip) * Number of visits
Distance (monthly) = 280 miles * 2
Distance (monthly) = 560 miles

So, the total distance John drives in a month when visiting his parents is 560 miles.

"To find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we can start by calculating the total number of toys produced by the other four workers during their 10-hour shift.

The two workers who produce 6 toys an hour will each produce:
6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 60 toys

Since there are two of them, together they produce:
60 toys * 2 = 120 toys

The other two workers who produce 4 toys an hour will each produce:
4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 40 toys

Since there are two of them, together they produce:
40 toys * 2 = 80 toys

The total number of toys produced by the four workers is:
120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys

The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to complete the order of 400 toys, which means that the four workers and the fifth worker together produced:
400 toys - 20 toys = 380 toys

Since the four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
380 toys - 200 toys = 180 toys

The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys/hour

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as V.

According to the problem, two years ago Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so we can write the equation:

14 = 2 * V

Now we solve for V:

V = 14 / 2
V = 7

This means that Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find out how old Vince is now, we add 2 years to his age at that time:

Vince's current age = V + 2
Vince's current age = 7 + 2
Vince's current age = 9

So, Vince is 9 years old now.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's call the number of eggs each of them painted ""A"".
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's call the number of eggs Camden painted ""C"" and the number of eggs Sarah painted ""S"".
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so we can write that as C = S + 12.
4. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56, so we can write that as A + A + C + S = 56, or 2A + C + S = 56.

Now we can substitute the value of C from step 3 into the equation from step 4:

2A + (S + 12) + S = 56
2A + 2S + 12 = 56
2A + 2S = 56 - 12
2A + 2S = 44
A + S = 22

Since we know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we can use the equation C + S = 30 and substitute C with S + 12:

(S + 12) + S = 30
2S + 12 = 30
2S = 30 - 12
2S = 18
S = 9

Now that we know Sarah painted 9 eggs, we can find out how many Camden painted:

C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Now we can find out how many eggs Arnold painted by using the equation A + S = 22:

A + 9 = 22
A = 22 - 9
A = 13

Finally, we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:

C - A = 21 - 13
C - A = 8

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes in ounces and then convert that weight to pounds.

First, we determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make with 200 crayons:
200 crayons / 8 crayons per group = 25 groups

Since each group goes into a box, there will be 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the weight of the crayons:
200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces

Then, we calculate the weight of the boxes:
25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

Now, we add the weight of the crayons and the boxes to get the total weight in ounces:
200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:
400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds.

"First, we need to determine how much of the tree can be used for logs. Since John can use 80% of the 80-foot tree, we calculate:

80 feet * 80% = 80 feet * 0.8 = 64 feet

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs can be cut from the 64 feet of usable tree:

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each of those logs, John cuts 5 planks:

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, we calculate the total amount John makes by selling each plank for $1.2:

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

So, John makes $96.

"To find the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the brother's salary:
   Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is 1/2 of what her brother earns, her brother earns:
   \( 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \) dollars per month.

2. Calculate their combined salary:
   Valerie's salary + Brother's salary = \( 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \) dollars per month.

3. Calculate the mother's salary:
   Since their mother earns twice their combined salary, the mother earns:
   \( 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \) dollars per month.

4. Calculate the total amount of money they all have together:
   Valerie's salary + Brother's salary + Mother's salary = \( 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \) dollars per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Grandma to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk and add that to the 40 minutes she spends on the beach.

First, let's find Grandma's walking speed on the beach. We know that she walks 2 miles in 40 minutes. To find her speed, we divide the distance by the time:

Speed on the beach = Distance / Time
Speed on the beach = 2 miles / 40 minutes
Speed on the beach = 1 mile / 20 minutes

This means Grandma takes 20 minutes to walk 1 mile on the beach.

Since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:

Speed on the sidewalk = 2 * (1 mile / 20 minutes)
Speed on the sidewalk = 1 mile / 10 minutes

Now we can calculate the time it takes for her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk:

Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed
Time on the sidewalk = 1 mile / (1 mile / 10 minutes)
Time on the sidewalk = 10 minutes

Finally, we add the time spent on the beach to the time spent on the sidewalk to get the total time for the 3-mile walk:

Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk
Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes
Total time = 50 minutes

"To find out how many marbles Bob has initially, we can set up an equation based on the information that if he receives 2 dozen (24) more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.

Let's denote the initial number of marbles Bob has as \( x \).

The equation will be:
\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles.

Now, if Bob loses 10 marbles, we can find out how many he will have left by subtracting 10 from his initial amount:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles left.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water. The resulting temperature \( T_{\text{result}} \) of the mixture can be calculated using the weighted average of the temperatures, where the weights are the volumes of water:

\[ T_{\text{result}} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{4 + 1} \]

We know that \( T_{\text{result}} \) must be at least 40 degrees:

\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40 \]

Now we solve for \( T \):

\[ 4 \times 33 + T \geq 40 \times 5 \]
\[ 132 + T \geq 200 \]
\[ T \geq 200 - 132 \]
\[ T \geq 68 \]

So, the water in the second mug must be at least 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the increase in the number of cows and chickens and then add these to the initial numbers.

First, let's calculate the increase in the number of cows:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in three weeks, there are 3 * 7 = 21 days.
- The total number of cows added in three weeks is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.

Next, let's calculate the increase in the number of chickens:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- In three weeks, the total number of chickens added is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add the initial number of animals to the increases:
- Initial cows: 50
- Initial chickens: 20
- Total cows after three weeks: 50 + 420 = 470
- Total chickens after three weeks: 20 + 210 = 230

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals:
- Total animals: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

"To find the cost per bagel after the discount, we first need to calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels with the discount applied, and then divide that total cost by the total number of bagels.

1. Calculate the total cost without the discount:
   4 packs * $10.00/pack = $40.00

2. Calculate the discount amount:
   10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

3. Subtract the discount from the total cost to get the discounted total:
   $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

4. Calculate the total number of bagels:
   4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels

5. Calculate the cost per bagel:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So we calculate:

23 scoops - 5 scoops = 18 scoops

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are used to make a certain number of scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So we calculate:

6 potatoes - 3 potatoes = 3 potatoes
3 scoops - 1 scoop = 2 scoops

This means that 3 potatoes are used to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are used per scoop, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops:

3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop

Now, we can calculate how many potatoes Gomer ate by multiplying the number of scoops he ate by the number of potatoes per scoop:

18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes per scoop = 27 potatoes

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of eggs he eats and then convert that number into dozens.

First, we calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

Next, we calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the following 30 days:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the two amounts to get the total number of eggs for 60 days:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens Chester will need:
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

So, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

Now, we can add the green and red jellybeans together to find out how many are not blue:
17 (green) + 34 (red) = 51 jellybeans.

Since there are 60 jellybeans in total, we can subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans:
60 (total) - 51 (green and red) = 9 blue jellybeans.

So, the number of blue jellybeans is 9.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus before any women alight.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total ratio parts are 5 + 9 = 14 parts.

The total number of passengers is 84, so each part of the ratio represents 84 / 14 = 6 passengers.

The number of women on the bus is 9 parts, so there are 9 * 6 = 54 women.

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is 54 - 20 = 34 women.

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold and the number of sunflowers sold as part of bouquets, and then add these two quantities together.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold:
- Faraday earns $2 for each individual sunflower.
- He earns $26 from individual sunflowers per day.
- Therefore, the number of individual sunflowers sold per day is $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers.

Now, let's calculate the number of sunflowers sold as part of bouquets:
- Each bouquet costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earns $56 from bouquets per day.
- Therefore, the number of bouquets sold per day is $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets.
- Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold as part of bouquets per day is 7 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers.

Now, let's add the individual sunflowers and the sunflowers from bouquets to get the total number of sunflowers sold per day:
- Total sunflowers sold per day = 13 individual sunflowers + 84 sunflowers from bouquets = 97 sunflowers.

Finally, to find out how many sunflowers were sold after 3 days, we multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by 3:
- Total sunflowers sold after 3 days = 97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers.

"To find the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probability of winning with the first ticket by the probability of winning with the second ticket.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket, so its probability of winning is 3 times 0.20, which is 0.60.

Now, we multiply the two probabilities together to find the probability that both tickets win:

0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.12 * 100 = 12%

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

So, the total number of fruits produced over 10 years is:

0 (1st year) + 0 (2nd year) + 0 (3rd year) + 0 (4th year) + 50 (5th year) + 150 (6th year) + 350 (7th year) + 800 (8th year) + 0 (9th year) + 1000 (10th year) = 2350 fruits.

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \), the length of the red rope as \( R \), and the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \).

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope:
   \( R = 4B \)

2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
   \( B = Y - 7 \)

3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
   \( R + B + Y = 37 \)

We can substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the third equation:

\( 4B + B + Y = 37 \)

Since \( B = Y - 7 \), we can substitute \( B \) in the equation:

\( 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \)

Now, let's solve for \( Y \):

\( 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \)
\( 6Y - 35 = 37 \)
\( 6Y = 72 \)
\( Y = 12 \)

Now that we have \( Y \), we can find \( B \):

\( B = Y - 7 \)
\( B = 12 - 7 \)
\( B = 5 \)

Finally, we can find \( R \):

\( R = 4B \)
\( R = 4 \times 5 \)
\( R = 20 \)

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Ronnie was given $5.
2. Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, which means Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, let's say each of them gave their little sister $x.

3. After giving $x to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money. This means that Rissa's remaining money is 4/5 * $15.

We can set up the equation for Rissa's remaining money after giving $x to her sister:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Solving for x:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, each of them gave $3 to their little sister.

4. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left after giving $3 to his sister. Ronnie originally had $5, so:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Ronnie is left with $2.

"The mural is divided into two main parts: half is yellow, and the other half is divided equally among red, white, and purple. 

Since the mural used 12 pints of paint in all, and half of it is yellow, that means 6 pints of paint are yellow.

The remaining 6 pints of paint are divided equally among the red, white, and purple colors. Since there are three colors and they are in equal amounts, each color (red, white, and purple) would use:

6 pints / 3 colors = 2 pints per color

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, and then add them together.

First, we calculate the area of one bedroom:
20 feet * 12 feet = 240 square feet

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area for the bedrooms is:
240 square feet/bedroom * 4 bedrooms = 960 square feet

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is:
240 square feet * 5 = 1200 square feet

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, we add the areas together to get the total area of the house:
960 square feet (bedrooms) + 1200 square feet (living room) + 1000 square feet (rest of the house) = 3160 square feet

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

"To find out how many clouds Alice counted in total from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of clouds she saw each day and then sum them up.

On Monday, she counts 3 clouds.
On Tuesday, she counts double the number from Monday, which is 3 * 2 = 6 clouds.
On Wednesday, she counts double the number from Tuesday, which is 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she counts double the number from Wednesday, which is 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she counts double the number from Thursday, which is 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.

Now, we add up all the clouds from each day to get the total:

3 (Monday) + 6 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 24 (Thursday) + 48 (Friday) = 93

So, the total number of clouds Alice counted from Monday to Friday is 93.

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pods in the special size box.
2. Determine the cost per pod in the special size box.
3. Calculate how many pods you can get for $1.
4. Since 1 pod is used per cycle, the number of pods you can get for $1 is the number of cycles you can run.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pods in the special size box.
The special size box has 20% more pods than the regular box of 100 pods.
20% of 100 pods is 20 pods.
So, the special size box has 100 pods + 20 pods = 120 pods.

Step 2: Determine the cost per pod in the special size box.
The special size box costs $12 for 120 pods.
The cost per pod is $12 / 120 pods = $0.10 per pod.

Step 3: Calculate how many pods you can get for $1.
Since each pod costs $0.10, for $1 you can get $1 / $0.10 per pod = 10 pods.

Step 4: Since 1 pod is used per cycle, the number of pods you can get for $1 is the number of cycles you can run.
You can run 10 cycles for $1.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills. To find out how many $20 bills he has, we divide $1000 by $20:
   \( \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \) bills.

2. He loses 10 of these $20 bills, so he has:
   \( 50 - 10 = 40 \) bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill, so he uses:
   \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) bills, and he has 20 bills left.

4. The value of the 20 $20 bills he has left is:
   \( 20 \times 20 = 400 \) dollars.

5. Thomas then triples his money, so he has:
   \( 400 \times 3 = 1200 \) dollars.

6. He then converts all his money to $5 bills. To find out how many $5 bills he has, we divide $1200 by $5:
   \( \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \) bills.

So, Thomas has 240 $5 bills.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First half:
- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

Second half:
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals.
- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, so team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Total goals:
- Team A's total goals = 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals.
- Team B's total goals = 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of both teams' goals:
- Total goals = Team A's total goals + Team B's total goals = 6 + 10 = 16 goals.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then determine how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk before it gets smaller than 2 inches, using only 20% of the remaining chalk each day.

1. Start with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
2. On Monday, the teacher uses 45% of the chalk, so he uses 5 * 0.45 = 2.25 inches of chalk.
3. After Monday, the remaining chalk is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.
4. Each subsequent day, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk.

We need to find out how many days it will take for the remaining chalk to be less than 2 inches. We can calculate this by repeatedly subtracting 20% of the remaining chalk each day until the length is less than 2 inches.

Let's calculate the remaining chalk for each day:

- Day 1 (Tuesday): 2.75 - (2.75 * 0.20) = 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 inches
- Day 2 (Wednesday): 2.20 - (2.20 * 0.20) = 2.20 - 0.44 = 1.76 inches

After Wednesday, the chalk is less than 2 inches, so the teacher will have to recycle it.

Therefore, the teacher can use the chalk for 2 more days (Tuesday and Wednesday) before he has to recycle it.

"To find out how many students are not on varsity, we first need to calculate how many boys and girls are on varsity.

One-third of the girls are on varsity:
12 girls * (1/3) = 4 girls

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity:
12 boys * (1/4) = 3 boys

Now, we add the number of boys and girls on varsity to get the total number of students on varsity:
4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students

The total number of students in the class is:
12 boys + 12 girls = 24 students

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:
24 students - 7 students = 17 students

So, the number of students not on varsity is 17.

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to calculate the total number of teeth the dentist works on and then divide that by the total number of teeth James has, and finally multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, which means the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped, which is 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.

James has 30 teeth in total, so the percentage of teeth the dentist fixes is (15 / 30) * 100.

Let's calculate that:

(15 / 30) * 100 = 0.5 * 100 = 50%

So, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the first statement, we have:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
This is because Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.

From the second statement, we have:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]
This is because in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

We can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"Let's break down the sequence of events to determine how many apples Newton brought home:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up both apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other one into the tree.
3. Throwing the apple into the tree caused 5 more apples to fall out.
4. Newton picked up these 5 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree.
5. Throwing this apple caused another 6 apples to fall out.
6. Newton picked up all the remaining apples and went home.

Now, let's count the apples:

- After the first event, Newton has 1 apple in his pocket.
- After the second event, he has 1 (from the first event) + 4 (from the 5 that fell, minus the one he threw) = 5 apples in his pocket.
- After the third event, he has 5 (from the previous total) + 6 (from the 6 that fell) = 11 apples in his pocket.

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices her friends will eat and then convert that into the number of whole pizzas.

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices her friends will eat:
6 friends * 6 slices each = 36 slices of cheese pizza

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we can find out how many cheese pizzas are needed by dividing the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 cheese pizzas

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices her friends will eat:
6 friends * 4 slices each = 24 slices of pepperoni pizza

Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we can find out how many pepperoni pizzas are needed by dividing the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pepperoni pizzas

Now, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas to find the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy:
3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 6 pizza pies in total.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs Jay can make per hour and then determine how long it will take him to reach 60 snowballs.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour. However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 sets of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs will melt 4 times in an hour, which is a total of 8 snowballs melted in an hour.

So, the net number of snowballs Jay can make in an hour is:
20 (built) - 8 (melted) = 12 snowballs per hour.

To find out how long it will take him to make 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs he wants to make by the net number of snowballs he can make in an hour:

60 snowballs / 12 snowballs per hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to make 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age difference between John and Jim and then use that to find Jim's current age.

1. First, we need to find out how old John was when Digimon came out. Since Digimon had its 20th anniversary, we can subtract 20 years from John's current age to find his age at that time.
   - John's age when Digimon came out: 28 - 20 = 8 years old

2. We know that when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. So, if John was 8 years old, Jim must have been half of John's age.
   - Jim's age when Digimon came out: 8 / 2 = 4 years old

3. Now, to find Jim's current age, we add 20 years to his age when Digimon came out.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
2. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages, and used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.

Now, let's calculate the total number of bandages used and received over the three days:

- Total bandages used: 38 (first day) + 28 (second day) + 25 (third day) = 91 bandages.
- Total bandages received: 50 (first day) + 100 (third day) = 150 bandages.

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. This means that the number of bandages they started with plus the bandages they received minus the bandages they used should equal 78.

Let's denote the number of bandages they started with as X. Then we can set up the following equation:

X (starting bandages) + 150 (received) - 91 (used) = 78 (left)

Now we solve for X:

X + 150 - 91 = 78
X + 59 = 78
X = 78 - 59
X = 19

So, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider both her regular earnings and the additional attendance bonus.

First, we calculate her regular earnings:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her weekly earnings are:
7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * $1.5/hour = 67.5 hours/week * $1.5/hour = $101.25/week

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her monthly earnings from her hourly rate are:
$101.25/week * 4 weeks = $405

Additionally, Jen receives a $10 bonus for each week of complete attendance. Since she did not incur any absences for the entire month, she receives this bonus for all 4 weeks:
$10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Now, we add her regular earnings to her attendance bonus to find her total earnings for April:
$405 + $40 = $445

Jen will receive $445 in April.

First, we calculate the number of red pens:
- Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
- Each pack has 5 pens.
- So, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 pens.

Next, we calculate the number of black pens:
- She bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens.
- Since she bought 5 packs of red pens, she bought 2 * 5 = 10 packs of black pens.
- Each pack has 5 pens, so the total number of black pens is 10 packs * 5 pens/pack = 50 pens.

Now, we add the number of red and black pens to find the total:
- Total pens = number of red pens + number of black pens
- Total pens = 25 pens + 50 pens = 75 pens.

So, Alain has 75 pens in total.

Next, we'll determine the number of bottles of cognac John buys:

Number of bottles of cognac = 2 * Number of bottles of scotch
Number of bottles of cognac = 2 * 10
Number of bottles of cognac = 20

Now, let's find the cost per bottle of cognac, which is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch:

Cost per bottle of cognac = Cost per bottle of scotch + (50% of Cost per bottle of scotch)
Cost per bottle of cognac = $60 + (0.5 * $60)
Cost per bottle of cognac = $60 + $30
Cost per bottle of cognac = $90

Now we can calculate the total cost of the cognac:

Total cost of cognac = Number of bottles of cognac * Cost per bottle of cognac
Total cost of cognac = 20 * $90
Total cost of cognac = $1800

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find the total amount spent:

Total amount spent = Total cost of scotch + Total cost of cognac
Total amount spent = $600 + $1800
Total amount spent = $2400

On the first day:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which means he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day:
- He planted 10 more White Oak trees, so he planted 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees in total over the two days.
- He planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day. 1/4 of 40 is 10, so he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

Now, let's add up all the trees he planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 30 trees.

"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge as \( m \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as an equation:

\[ 4m + 8 = 40 \]

To find the value of \( m \), we need to solve the equation:

\[ 4m + 8 = 40 \]
\[ 4m = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4m = 32 \]
\[ m = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ m = 8 \]

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge.

"To find out how many fish have red stripes and blue stripes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of fish with red stripes.
2. Subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total to find the number of remaining fish.
3. Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish.
4. Add the number of fish with red stripes to the number of fish with blue stripes to get the total number of fish with either red or blue stripes.

Let's start with step 1:

1. One-third of the fish have red stripes, so we calculate:
   \( \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \) fish have red stripes.

Now, step 2:

2. Subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total:
   \( 66 - 22 = 44 \) fish remain.

For step 3:

3. Five-elevenths of the remaining fish have blue stripes, so we calculate:
   \( \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \) fish have blue stripes.

Finally, step 4:

4. Add the number of fish with red stripes to the number of fish with blue stripes:
   \( 22 + 20 = 42 \) fish have either red or blue stripes.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Amy originally had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes.
2. She also had three makeup sets with six eyeshadow colors each, so that's 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.
3. Her sister steals one of the palettes, so Amy loses 4 colors, leaving her with 8 - 4 = 4 colors from the remaining palette.
4. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, so she uses 6 / 2 = 3 colors from that set.
5. After using up 3 colors from one makeup set, she has 6 - 3 = 3 colors left from that set.
6. The other two makeup sets are untouched, so she still has 2 * 6 = 12 colors from those sets.

Now, let's add up all the colors Amy has left:

- 4 colors from the remaining palette
- 3 colors from the partially used makeup set
- 12 colors from the two untouched makeup sets

So, Amy has 4 + 3 + 12 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To find out how high the roof is from the second floor's floor, we need to calculate the height of the house and the height of the first floor, then subtract the first floor's height from the total height of the house.

1. Mattison's height is 60 inches.
2. The house is 7 times as high as Mattison, so the house's height is 60 inches * 7 = 420 inches.
3. The first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so the first floor's height is 60 inches * 3 = 180 inches.

The height from the second floor's floor to the roof is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor:

420 inches (total height) - 180 inches (first floor height) = 240 inches.

"To find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas.
2. Subtract the shells found by team Alphas from the total to find the remaining shells.
3. Calculate the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells.
4. Subtract the shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters.

Let's do the math:

1. Team Alphas found 40% of 700 shells:
   \( 700 \times 0.40 = 280 \) shells

2. Subtract the shells found by team Alphas from the total:
   \( 700 - 280 = 420 \) shells remaining

3. Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:
   \( 420 \times 0.60 = 252 \) shells

4. Subtract the shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters:
   \( 420 - 252 = 168 \) shells

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information about the average distance walked by the dogs. The average distance is the total distance walked by all dogs divided by the number of dogs.

Let's denote the distance the last dog needs to walk as \( x \) miles.

The total distance walked by all dogs is the sum of the distances walked by each dog, which is:
1 mile (first dog) + 4 miles (second dog) + 3 miles (third dog) + \( x \) miles (last dog).

The average distance walked per dog is 3 miles, and there are 4 dogs, so the total distance walked by all dogs is:
3 miles/dog * 4 dogs = 12 miles.

Now we can set up the equation:
1 + 4 + 3 + \( x \) = 12.

Solving for \( x \):
8 + \( x \) = 12,
\( x \) = 12 - 8,
\( x \) = 4.

The last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

First, we calculate the loan amount:
\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we calculate the amount he uses to pay off his debts, which is 60% of the loan amount:
\[ \text{Amount used to pay off debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we calculate the leftover amount after paying off his debts:
\[ \text{Leftover amount} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

"To find Trinity's profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

The selling price is 11/8 of the buying price. If the buying price is $72, then the selling price is:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

Let's calculate the selling price:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = 11 \times 9 = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

So, Trinity's profit is $27.

"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. On the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day. Over 3 days, it would remove:
   1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters

2. On the medium setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much as the low setting, which is 2 liters per day. Over 3 days, it would remove:
   2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters

3. On the high setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much as the medium setting, which is 4 liters per day. Over 5 days, it would remove:
   4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters

Now, we add up the water removed at each setting to get the total amount of water removed:
3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 29 liters

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we need to calculate the total capacity of the classes in each school and then add them together.

First, let's find the capacity of each of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

120 students / 8 = 15 students

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

15 students/class * 2 classes = 30 students

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's school, which is just the capacity of his one class:

120 students

Finally, we add the capacities of both schools together to get the combined capacity:

"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the total amount he owes including the interest, and then subtract the amount he has already paid over the 11 months.

First, let's calculate the interest on the $300 that Stephen borrowed. The interest is 2% of $300.

Interest = 2% of $300
Interest = 0.02 * $300
Interest = $6

So, the total amount Stephen owes is the original $300 plus the $6 interest, which is $306.

Next, we need to calculate how much Stephen has paid over the 11 months. He pays $25 per month.

Total paid over 11 months = 11 * $25
Total paid over 11 months = $275

Now, we subtract the amount Stephen has already paid from the total amount he owes to find out how much he will pay in the twelfth month.

Amount to pay in the twelfth month = Total amount owed - Total paid over 11 months
Amount to pay in the twelfth month = $306 - $275
Amount to pay in the twelfth month = $31

So, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month.

"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of diaper changes per day for both children.
2. Determine how many of those diaper changes Jordan's wife handles.
3. Subtract the number of diaper changes Jordan's wife handles from the total to find out how many Jordan changes.

Step 1: Total number of diaper changes per day
Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, so:
5 diaper changes/child/day * 2 children = 10 diaper changes/day

Step 2: Number of diaper changes Jordan's wife handles
Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so:
10 diaper changes/day * 1/2 = 5 diaper changes/day

Step 3: Number of diaper changes Jordan handles
Subtract the number of diaper changes Jordan's wife handles from the total:
10 diaper changes/day - 5 diaper changes/day = 5 diaper changes/day

Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to calculate the total number of jelly beans he estimated to be in the jar and then find out how many of those he estimated to be red. We can then compare his estimate of the number of red jelly beans to the true number, which is 900.

First, we calculate the volume of the jar:
Volume of the jar = base area * height
Volume of the jar = 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches
Volume of the jar = 36 * 15
Volume of the jar = 540 cubic inches

Next, we calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans, taking into account the 80% packing efficiency:
Effective volume = volume of the jar * packing efficiency
Effective volume = 540 cubic inches * 0.80
Effective volume = 432 cubic inches

Now, we calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar based on the effective volume and the volume of a single jelly bean:
Total number of jelly beans = effective volume / volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red:
Estimated number of red jelly beans = total number of jelly beans * 30%
Estimated number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.30
Estimated number of red jelly beans = 864

The true number of red jelly beans is 900, so we can now calculate how far off Tim's guess was:
Difference = true number of red jelly beans - estimated number of red jelly beans
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The bus departed Chengli city with 20 people.
2. On the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, so the total number of people on the bus is now 20 + 40 = 60 people.
3. On the second stop, 3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered the bus. That's 3/4 * 40 = 30 people.
4. After the second stop, the total number of people on the bus is 60 + 30 = 90 people.
5. At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus is now 90 * 2 = 180 people.
6. The bus has a capacity of 200 people, so the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 200 - 180 = 20 people.

"To calculate the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost of visits for the first 5 years and the cost of visits for the next 3 years after the price increase.

1. For the first 5 years:
- Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
- The cost of one visit is $2.
- The total cost for one year is 3 visits * $2/visit = $6/year.
- The total cost for 5 years is 5 years * $6/year = $30.

2. For the next 3 years after the price increase:
- The cost of one visit has increased by 150%.
- 150% of $2 is 1.5 * $2 = $3.
- The new cost of one visit is $2 + $3 = $5.
- The total cost for one year after the increase is 3 visits * $5/visit = $15/year.
- The total cost for 3 years after the increase is 3 years * $15/year = $45.

3. The total amount spent over the 8 years is the sum of the costs for the first 5 years and the next 3 years:
- Total amount spent = $30 (first 5 years) + $45 (next 3 years) = $75.

Therefore, Pauline spent a total of $75 on all visits to the museum.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed from the 10 students in each grade, and then calculate the total time required for all groups to complete the escape room challenge.

Since there are 10 students in each grade and only 8 can try the escape room at a time, we can form one group of 8 and one group of 2 (which will need to be paired with other students to form a full group of 8). However, since the question specifies that only the top 10 students in each grade get to try the escape room, and only 8 can go at a time, we will have to form two groups of 8 by combining the top 10 from each grade.

There are 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th), so we have:

- 4 grades * 10 students = 40 students in total.
- 40 students / 8 students per group = 5 groups.

Each group takes 45 minutes to complete the escape room, so the total time required for all groups is:

- 5 groups * 45 minutes per group = 225 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 5x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

The length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The longer piece is 4 times this length:

"To find out how much of his secret seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of ground beef are needed for 80 meatballs.
2. Calculate the amount of seasoning needed based on the number of pounds of ground beef.

Step 1: Since Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs he wants to make by the number of meatballs per pound to find out how many pounds of meat he needs.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of ground beef

Step 2: Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef. So, we multiply the number of pounds of ground beef by the amount of seasoning per pound.

5 pounds of ground beef * 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning

Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( c \).
2. According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. So the number of brownies \( b \) can be expressed as \( b = 3c - 2 \).
3. Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats. Therefore, the total number of treats needed is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).
4. The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and brownies, so \( c + b = 10 \).

Now we can substitute the expression for \( b \) into the equation for the total number of treats:

\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Solving for \( c \):

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after the 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after the 50% decrease.

Step 1: December price increase
The price in November was $40. An 80% increase means the price in December is:
\[ \text{December Price} = \text{November Price} + (\text{November Price} \times 80\%) \]
\[ \text{December Price} = 40 + (40 \times 0.80) \]
\[ \text{December Price} = 40 + 32 \]

Step 2: January price decrease
The price in January is 50% less than the December price:
\[ \text{January Price} = \text{December Price} - (\text{December Price} \times 50\%) \]
\[ \text{January Price} = 72 - (72 \times 0.50) \]
\[ \text{January Price} = 72 - 36 \]
\[ \text{January Price} = 36 \]

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36.

"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of teachers who were sick from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers who were called in.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of teachers who were sick = 13
Number of substitute teachers = 9

Number of teachers at school = Total number of teachers - Number of teachers who were sick + Number of substitute teachers
Number of teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9
Number of teachers at school = 69 + 9
Number of teachers at school = 78

"To find out how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

The weekly cost is the sum of the cost of the pasta, the cheddar cheese, and the gruyere cheese.

- Pasta cost: $1.00
- Cheddar cheese cost: $3.00
- Gruyere cheese cost: 2 * $3.00 = $6.00

Now, let's add these costs to find the total weekly cost:

$1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar) + $6.00 (gruyere) = $10.00

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the yearly cost is:

$10.00 (weekly cost) * 52 (weeks) = $520.00

So, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year.

"To find the percentage of the day the custodian spends cleaning classrooms, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time the custodian has to clean in minutes over 5 days.
2. Calculate the total time the custodian spends cleaning per day.
3. Calculate the total time the custodian works in a day in minutes.
4. Calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning.

Step 1: Total time to clean all classrooms
- There are 80 classrooms and it takes 15 minutes to clean each one.
- Total cleaning time = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Step 2: Total time spent cleaning per day
- The custodian has 5 days to clean all the classrooms.
- Cleaning time per day = Total cleaning time / 5 days = 1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes/day

Step 3: Total work time in a day
- The custodian works an 8-hour day.
- Work time in minutes = 8 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day

Step 4: Percentage of the day spent cleaning
- Percentage of day spent cleaning = (Cleaning time per day / Work time in a day) * 100
- Percentage of day spent cleaning = (240 minutes/day / 480 minutes/day) * 100 = 0.5 * 100 = 50%

The custodian spends 50% of their day cleaning classrooms.

"To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the total number of books that one bookcase can hold.

1. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books, so together they can hold:
   2 shelves * 10 books/shelf = 20 books

2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold:
   2 * 10 books = 20 books

3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold:
   20 books - 5 books = 15 books

4. The total number of books one bookcase can hold is the sum of the books on all the shelves:
   20 books (middle shelves) + 20 books (bottom shelf) + 15 books (top shelf) = 55 books

5. To find out how many bookcases Elly needs for her 110 books, we divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold:
   110 books / 55 books/bookcase = 2 bookcases

Since we cannot have a fraction of a bookcase, and 110 is exactly divisible by 55, Elly will need 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To calculate Rose's profit, we need to determine her total cost and her total revenue, then subtract the cost from the revenue.

First, we calculate the total cost of the eggs:
- Rose bought five dozens of eggs.
- Each dozen costs $2.40.
- Total cost = 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00.

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs:
- There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so five dozens contain 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.
- Rose sells the eggs at a rate of $1 for 3 eggs.
- To find out how many sets of 3 eggs there are in 60 eggs, we divide 60 by 3, which gives us 20 sets.
- Total revenue = 20 sets * $1/set = $20.00.

Finally, we calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00.

Rose's profit is $8.00.

2. Subtract the number of red hats from the total to find out how many hats are not red.
3. Calculate the number of blue hats, which is 3/5 of the remaining hats after the red ones are taken out.
4. Subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats to find out how many are white.

Let's do the math:

1. Number of red hats: \(100 \times \frac{1}{2} = 50\)
2. Remaining hats after red: \(100 - 50 = 50\)
3. Number of blue hats: \(50 \times \frac{3}{5} = 30\)
4. Number of white hats: \(50 - 30 = 20\)

So, Skyler has 20 white hats.

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade, we need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly across both tests, and then subtract the number of questions she already got right on the first test.

First, let's find out the total number of questions across both tests:
- The first test has 70 questions.
- The second test has 40 questions.
- Total questions = 70 + 40 = 110 questions.

Next, we calculate the number of questions she needs to get right to pass, which is 70% of the total questions:
- 70% of 110 questions = 0.70 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, let's see how many questions she got right on the first test:
- She got 60% of the 70 questions correct.
- 60% of 70 questions = 0.60 * 70 = 42 questions.

To find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get right:
- Questions needed on the second test = 77 - 42 = 35 questions.

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be written as:

\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, which is the sum of the strawberry and blueberry cubes:

\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:

\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( B \):

\[ B = 5 \times 20 - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96.

"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break down the problem into steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many customers need to come into the dealership to sell 15 cars. Since for every 2 customers, 1 buys a car, we can set up the following ratio:
   \[ \frac{1 \text{ car sold}}{2 \text{ customers}} = \frac{15 \text{ cars sold}}{x \text{ customers}} \]
   Solving for \( x \) gives us the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:
   \[ x = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ customers} \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to get 30 customers to come into the dealership. Since for every 25 calls, 1 customer comes in, we can set up the following ratio:
   \[ \frac{1 \text{ customer}}{25 \text{ calls}} = \frac{30 \text{ customers}}{y \text{ calls}} \]
   Solving for \( y \) gives us the number of calls needed to get 30 customers:
   \[ y = 30 \times 25 = 750 \text{ calls} \]

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To solve this, let's break down the information:

- There are 4 people, so there are 4 flashlights (1 for each person).
- There are 8 rooms, so there are 8 * 2 = 16 flashlights for the rooms.
- For the candles, half the rooms (4 rooms) have 4 small candles each, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 small candles.
- The other half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each, so there are 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles.

Now, let's add up all the flashlights and candles:

- Total flashlights: 4 (personal) + 16 (rooms) = 20 flashlights
- Total candles: 16 (small) + 20 (medium) = 36 candles

Finally, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together:

- Total items: 20 (flashlights) + 36 (candles) = 56 items

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, let's break down the time it takes for each side of the Rubik's cube:

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first, so they each take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.
- The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first, so they each take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.
- The sixth side is completed when the fifth side is done, so it doesn't add any additional time.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes
- Sixth side: 0 minutes (included in the fifth side)

"To find out how many calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Tim works in a week.
2. Convert the total hours into minutes.
3. Divide the total minutes by the time it takes to deal with one call to find the number of calls.

Step 1: Total hours in a week
Tim works 6 hours each day, and he works 5 days a week.
Total hours in a week = 6 hours/day * 5 days/week = 30 hours/week

Step 2: Convert hours to minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Phineas Frog to travel half the distance on land and half the distance in water.

The total distance Phineas needs to travel is 200 yards. Half of this distance is 100 yards on land and the other half is 100 yards in water.

On land, Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute. To find out how long it takes him to travel 100 yards, we divide the distance by his speed:
100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

In water, Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute. To find out how long it takes him to travel 100 yards, we divide the distance by his speed:
100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

To find the total time it takes for Phineas to return home, we add the time spent on land to the time spent in water:
5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of lemons Tim will need for the lemonade for the pool party and the extra gallon for Allen.

First, we calculate the number of lemons needed for the 4 gallons of regular lemonade:
- 1 gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of lemon juice.
- 4 gallons of lemonade will require 4 cups of lemon juice.
- 6 lemons yield 1 cup of lemon juice.
- Therefore, 4 gallons will require 4 * 6 = 24 lemons.

Next, we calculate the number of lemons needed for the extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart:
- 1 gallon of extra tart lemonade requires 2 cups of lemon juice (since it's twice as tart).
- 6 lemons yield 1 cup of lemon juice.
- Therefore, 1 gallon of extra tart lemonade will require 2 * 6 = 12 lemons.

Now, we add the lemons needed for the regular lemonade and the extra tart lemonade:
- 24 lemons for the regular lemonade + 12 lemons for the extra tart lemonade = 36 lemons.

So, Tim will need 36 lemons in total.

"To find out how many pink candies are in the bag, we need to first determine the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies, and then subtract that from the total number of candies in the bag.

- Red candies: 54
- Orange candies: 54 * 2 = 108
- Yellow candies: 54 / 2 = 27

Now, let's add up the red, orange, and yellow candies:

54 (red) + 108 (orange) + 27 (yellow) = 189

Next, we subtract this total from the total number of candies in the bag to find out how many are pink:

232 (total candies) - 189 (red, orange, and yellow candies) = 43

So, the number of pink candies is:

"To find out how much Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels during her trip, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel stays and the cost of the bus rides, and then add them together.

The cost of one night at the hotel is $80. Since Helen stayed for 3 nights, the total cost for the hotel is:
3 nights * $80/night = $240

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. So, the cost of one bus trip is:
10% of $80 = 0.10 * $80 = $8

Helen rode the bus 7 times, so the total cost for the bus rides is:
7 rides * $8/ride = $56

Now, we add the total cost of the hotel and the total cost of the bus rides to find the total amount Helen paid:
$240 (hotel) + $56 (bus) = $296

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to first determine how many marbles Dallas originally had before dropping 4 of them. Since Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4, we can add those 4 back to find the original amount:

21 (current marbles) + 4 (dropped marbles) = 25 (original marbles)

Now we know that Dallas originally had 25 marbles. Since Mazie had 52 marbles in total and gave all of them to the twins, we can subtract the number of marbles Dallas received from the total to find out how many Darla received:

52 (total marbles) - 25 (Dallas's marbles) = 27 (Darla's marbles)

So, Mazie gave Darla 27 marbles.

"To calculate the force John needs to push the car, we need to first determine the total weight of the car including the luggage and the children. Then we will calculate 1% of that total weight to find the force required.

The total weight is the sum of the car's weight, the luggage's weight, and the children's weight:

Total weight = Car's weight + Luggage's weight + (2 × Children's weight)
Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + (2 × 75 pounds)
Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + 150 pounds
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Now, we calculate 1% of the total weight to find the force required:

Force required = 1% of Total weight
Force required = 0.01 × 1600 pounds
Force required = 16 pounds

"To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and 16 years younger than Emma, we can calculate Emma's age as follows:

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16 years
Emma's age = 40 years + 16 years
Emma's age = 56 years

Now that we have both ages, we can calculate the average:

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 years + 56 years) / 2
Average age = 96 years / 2
Average age = 48 years

Bowls cost $5.00 each, so for 12 people, the cost will be:
12 * $5.00 = $60.00

Salad plates cost $4.00 each, so for 12 people, the cost will be:
12 * $4.00 = $48.00

Now, we add up the costs for all the items:
$72.00 + $60.00 + $48.00 = $180.00

Therefore, Avery will spend $180.00 on place settings.

"To find out how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in that time.

First, we calculate the daily feed consumption for one pig:
4 pounds of feed * 2 times a day = 8 pounds of feed per day for one pig.

Next, we calculate the daily feed consumption for all five pigs:
8 pounds of feed per day * 5 pigs = 40 pounds of feed per day for all pigs.

Now, we calculate the weekly feed consumption for all five pigs:
40 pounds of feed per day * 7 days = 280 pounds of feed per week for all pigs.

Finally, we subtract the weekly feed consumption from the total amount of feed Dexter ordered:
300 pounds of feed - 280 pounds of feed = 20 pounds of feed left after a week.

"To determine how much John needs to spend on hot dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hot dogs needed for the party.
2. Subtract the number of hot dogs John already has.
3. Determine how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy.
4. Calculate the total cost based on the number of packs.

Step 1: Total number of hot dogs needed
- John invited 20 people and each will eat 2 hot dogs.
- Total hot dogs needed = 20 guests * 2 hot dogs/guest = 40 hot dogs

Step 2: Subtract the hot dogs John already has

"To find out how much money Frances has left, we need to calculate her total earnings from selling cupcakes and cookies, and then subtract the cost of the trays she bought.

First, we calculate the earnings from the cupcakes:
20 cupcakes * $2/cupcake = $40

Next, we calculate the earnings from the cookies:
40 cookies * $1/cookie = $40

Now, we add the earnings from cupcakes and cookies to get the total earnings:
$40 (from cupcakes) + $40 (from cookies) = $80

Then, we calculate the cost of the trays:
5 trays * $4/tray = $20

Finally, we subtract the cost of the trays from the total earnings to find out how much money Frances has left:
$80 (total earnings) - $20 (cost of trays) = $60

So, Frances has $60 left.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. At the end of the first street, there are 5 children following the truck.
2. On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so the number of children doubles: 5 * 2 = 10 children.
3. On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children, so the number of children is now 10 * 3 = 30 children.
4. The original 5 children then give up and leave the group, so we subtract them from the total: 30 - 5 = 25 children.

The final number of children following the truck is:

"To find out how much time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation:
- Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so that's 15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so she meditates for 30 minutes * 7 days = 210 minutes per week.
- Over 4 weeks, she will meditate for 210 minutes * 4 = 840 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on yoga:
- Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour, which is 60 minutes, 5 days a week.
- So, she practices yoga for 60 minutes * 5 days = 300 minutes per week.
- Over 4 weeks, she will practice yoga for 300 minutes * 4 = 1200 minutes.

Now, let's add the time spent on meditation and yoga together:
- Total time spent on meditation and yoga = 840 minutes (meditation) + 1200 minutes (yoga) = 2040 minutes.

To convert the total time into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
- 2040 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 34 hours.

So, in 4 weeks, Charisma has spent 34 hours on meditation and yoga practice.

8 medium t-shirts * 4 square feet per medium t-shirt = 32 square feet

For the large t-shirts:
6 large t-shirts * 6 square feet per large t-shirt = 36 square feet

Now, we add the square footage of all the t-shirts together:
33 square feet (small) + 32 square feet (medium) + 36 square feet (large) = 101 square feet

The total square footage of the quilt is 101 square feet.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer.
2. Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne.
3. Anne is twice the size of Albert.
4. Albert is 36 inches tall.

First, we find Anne's height:
Anne's height = 2 * Albert's height
Anne's height = 2 * 36 inches
Anne's height = 72 inches

Now, we know Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne:
Jackie's current height = Anne's height - 2 inches
Jackie's current height = 72 inches - 2 inches
Jackie's current height = 70 inches

Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, so to find her height before the summer, we subtract 3 inches from her current height:
Jackie's height before summer = Jackie's current height - 3 inches
Jackie's height before summer = 70 inches - 3 inches
Jackie's height before summer = 67 inches

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation.
2. Determine the net number of holes filled by Nate each day after he returns.
3. Calculate how many days it will take Nate to fill in all the holes.
4. Convert the number of days into weeks.

Step 1: Total number of holes dug by the dog
The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Step 2: Net number of holes filled by Nate each day
Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes each night, so the net number of holes filled each day is:
9 holes/day - 6 holes/night = 3 holes/day

Step 3: Number of days to fill in all the holes
To find out how many days it will take Nate to fill in all 84 holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled each day:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Step 4: Convert days to weeks
Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the number of days by 7 to get the number of weeks:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

So, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it took Vanessa to run her part of the race. We know that Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, and Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did.

First, let's find out how far Aaron ran. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles and that is twice the distance Aaron ran, Aaron must have run 2 miles.

Next, we need to find out how long it took Aaron to run 1 mile. Since Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes, it took him 16 / 2 = 8 minutes to run 1 mile.

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, it means that Vanessa takes twice as long to run a mile. Therefore, it takes Vanessa 8 * 2 = 16 minutes to run 1 mile.

Now, we can calculate the time it took Vanessa to run her 4 miles. Since it takes her 16 minutes to run 1 mile, it will take her 16 * 4 = 64 minutes to run 4 miles.

The final answer is:
64"
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply 200 feet by 3:

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line/foot of dock = 600 feet of line

The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line, so we subtract that from the total required:

600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

"To calculate how much Tom's restaurant makes a week from reservations, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of one reservation.
2. Multiply the cost of one reservation by the number of reservations per night.
3. Multiply the nightly income by the number of days the restaurant is open per week.

Step 1: Cost of one reservation
- 2 meals at $5 each: 2 * $5 = $10
- 1 bottle of wine: $5
- Total cost per reservation: $10 + $5 = $15

Step 2: Nightly income
- Number of reservations per night: 6
- Income per night: 6 * $15 = $90

Step 3: Weekly income
- Days open per week: 2
- Weekly income: $90 * 2 = $180

The final numerical answer is:
180"
"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we first need to calculate the total selling price of all the watermelons, and then divide that by the number of watermelons.

The vendor made a profit of 25%, so the total selling price is 125% of the cost price.

The cost price for 50 watermelons is $80.

The total selling price is:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} \times (1 + \text{Profit Percentage}) \]
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = \$80 \times (1 + 0.25) \]
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = \$80 \times 1.25 \]
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = \$100 \]

Now, to find the selling price per watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} \]
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\$100}{50} \]
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \$2 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so Dora is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.
2. James is now twice as old as Dora, so James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.
3. John had James when he was 19, so John is now 18 + 19 = 37 years old.
4. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.
5. In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then find the difference.

First, we convert an hour into minutes:
1 hour = 60 minutes

Next, we calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges

Then, we calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 oranges

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Mark gets the radiator for 80% off, so he pays 20% of the original price. The original price is $400, so he pays:

$400 * 20% = $400 * 0.20 = $80 for the radiator.

The mechanic charges $50 per hour for 3 hours, so the labor cost is:

$50 * 3 = $150.

The total cost for the radiator and the labor is:

$80 + $150 = $230.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( c \) as the number of chickens,
- \( k \) as the number of cows.

We know that:
1. The total number of animals is 20, so \( c + k = 20 \).
2. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70, so \( 2c + 4k = 70 \).

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of \( c \) and \( k \).

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know there are 15 cows, we can substitute \( k \) back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to calculate the total number of slices and then divide that number by the number of people.

There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:
7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people. To find out how many slices each person gets, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:
56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person

So, each of them can have 14 slices.
