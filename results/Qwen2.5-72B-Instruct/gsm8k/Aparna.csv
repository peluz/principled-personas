"To determine the total number of bolts needed for a robe, we need to add the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. It takes half that much white fiber, which is:

1/2 * 2 bolts = 1 bolt of white fiber.

So, the total number of bolts is:

2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts.

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to calculate the final value of the house after the repairs and then subtract the total cost (purchase price plus repair costs) from this value.

The value of the house increased by 150% due to the repairs. This means the value of the house after repairs is 250% of the original value (100% original value + 150% increase).

First, we calculate the 250% of the original value of the house:
250% of $80,000 = 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000

This is the new value of the house after the repairs. Now, we need to calculate the total cost Josh incurred:
Total cost = Purchase price + Repair costs
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
Profit = New value of the house - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

So, Josh's profit is $70,000.

"James runs 3 sprints each session, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. To find the total meters he runs a week, we can multiply the number of sprints per session by the distance of each sprint and then multiply that by the number of sessions per week.

So, the calculation is:

3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint * 3 sessions/week

Now, let's do the math:

3 * 60 * 3 = 540 meters

James runs a total of 540 meters a week."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to calculate the total amount of feed required for the day and then subtract the amount already given in the morning and afternoon meals.

Each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups

Wendi has already given:
15 cups in the morning + 25 cups in the afternoon = 40 cups

The remaining amount of feed needed for the final meal is:
60 cups (total daily requirement) - 40 cups (already given) = 20 cups

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To calculate the total cost for 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: every first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

We can pair the glasses into sets of two, with each set costing $5 (for the first glass) + $3 (for the second glass) = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide this number by 2 to find out how many sets of two glasses he will buy:
16 glasses / 2 glasses per set = 8 sets.

Now, we multiply the number of sets by the cost per set:
8 sets * $8 per set = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, to find the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together, we add the number of sheep in each city:

Seattle's sheep + Charleston's sheep + Toulouse's sheep = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file, including the time lost due to the Windows update.

1. First, we calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file:
   40% of 200 GB is 0.40 * 200 GB = 80 GB.

2. Since Carla downloads at a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is:
   80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

3. After the download is interrupted, Carla has to wait for the Windows update, which takes 20 minutes.

4. After the update, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. The time to download the full 200 GB file is:
   200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

5. The total time to download the file, including the time lost to the update, is the sum of the time to download 40% of the file, the update time, and the time to download the full file again:
   40 minutes (for 80 GB) + 20 minutes (update) + 100 minutes (for 200 GB) = 160 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is 160 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance John travels in each segment of his trip and then determine how far he is from home at the end of the 4 hours.

1. First, we calculate the distance John travels away from home:
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. Now, we calculate the distance John travels back towards home:
   - He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles.
   - He then drives for half an hour at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - For the remaining time (4 hours total - 2.5 hours already spent = 1.5 hours), he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. We add the distances he traveled back towards home:
   - Total distance back = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

4. Finally, we subtract the distance he traveled back from the distance he traveled away to find out how far he is from home:
   - Distance from home = Distance away - Distance back = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider both her regular pay for the first 40 hours and her overtime pay for the additional hours she worked.

Regular pay for the first 40 hours:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

Overtime pay for the additional 5 hours:
5 hours * ($10/hour * 1.2) = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings for the week:
$400 (regular pay) + $60 (overtime pay) = $460

"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, which is:
3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads was reduced by 30% from the second month's downloads. The reduction in downloads is:
30% of 180 = 0.30 * 180 = 54 downloads.

So, the number of downloads in the third month is:
180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

The total number of downloads over the three months is the sum of the downloads from each month:
60 (first month) + 180 (second month) + 126 (third month) = 366 downloads.

"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum them up.

For the donuts:
3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen would be 3 * $68 = $204

For the mini cupcakes:
2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen would be 2 * $80 = $160

For the mini cheesecakes:
6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen would be 6 * $55 = $330

Now, we add up the costs of all the pastries:
$204 (donuts) + $160 (mini cupcakes) + $330 (mini cheesecakes) = $694

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and then see how many years it will take for the cumulative net profit to cover the initial planting cost.

The initial cost to plant the tree is $90.

Each year, the tree will produce 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each, so the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
7 lemons * $1.5/lemon = $10.5

The annual cost to water and feed the tree is $3.

The net profit per year is the annual revenue minus the annual cost:
$10.5 - $3 = $7.5

To find out how many years it will take to cover the initial cost of $90, we divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:
$90 / $7.5 = 12

So, it will take 12 years for the net profit to cover the initial planting cost. However, at the end of the 12th year, he will have just covered the cost, not started earning money. Therefore, he will start earning money in the 13th year.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with be \( x \).
2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there.
3. After the green house, she has \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she has \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
5. At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.
6. After the orange house, she has \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left, which is given to be 5.

So we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Now we solve for \( x \):

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]
\[ 2x = 36 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

1. Calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance.
2. Subtract the number of contemporary dance students from the total to find the remaining students.
3. Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students.
4. Subtract the number of jazz dance students from the remaining students to find the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
5. Calculate the percentage of the entire class that is enrolled in hip-hop dance.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Number of students in contemporary dance:
   20% of 20 students = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students

2. Remaining students after contemporary dance:
   20 students - 4 students = 16 students

3. Number of students in jazz dance:
   25% of the remaining 16 students = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

4. Remaining students after jazz dance (enrolled in hip-hop dance):
   16 students - 4 students = 12 students

5. Percentage of students in hip-hop dance:
   (12 students / 20 students) * 100% = 60%

"To determine which purchase plan will yield the higher profit, we need to calculate the profit for each option.

For the jewelry:
- Initial cost: $5,000
- Market increase: 2.5%
- Profit from jewelry = $5,000 * 2.5% = $5,000 * 0.025 = $125

For the electronic gadgets:
- Initial cost: $8,000
- Market increase: 1.2%
- Profit from electronic gadgets = $8,000 * 1.2% = $8,000 * 0.012 = $96

The merchant should choose the option that yields the higher profit. In this case, the jewelry will provide a higher profit.

The profit from the jewelry is $125, which is the maximum profit the merchant can make from the two options.

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her weekly earnings from both jobs and then multiply by the number of weeks she works in a year.

First, we calculate her weekly earnings from teaching:
$20 per hour * 35 hours per week = $700 per week

Next, we calculate her weekly earnings from cheerleading coaching:
$30 per hour * 15 hours per week = $450 per week

Now, we add the two weekly earnings to find her total weekly income:
$700 per week + $450 per week = $1150 per week

Finally, we multiply her total weekly income by the number of weeks she works in a year to find her annual salary:
$1150 per week * 50 weeks per year = $57,500 per year

Jill's annual salary is $57,500."

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Marissa should take to hike the 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.
2. Determine the time Marissa has already spent hiking.
3. Calculate the remaining time she has to complete the trail.
4. Determine the remaining distance she has to hike.
5. Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance.

Step 1: Total time to hike 12 miles at 4 miles per hour:
Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Step 2: Time already spent hiking:
Time for first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time for next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent = 1 hour + 1 hour
Total time spent = 2 hours

Step 3: Remaining time to complete the trail:
Remaining time = Total time - Time already spent
Remaining time = 3 hours - 2 hours
Remaining time = 1 hour

Step 4: Remaining distance to hike:
Total distance = 12 miles
Distance already hiked = 4 miles + 2 miles
Distance already hiked = 6 miles
Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance already hiked
Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles
Remaining distance = 6 miles

Step 5: Required speed for the remaining distance:
Required speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Required speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Required speed = 6 miles per hour

Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in both the orange drink and the pineapple drink, and then sum them up after accounting for the spill.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink before the spill:
- The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in it is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 \) liters.

Now, let's calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:
- The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in it is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 \) liters.

Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, we need to subtract the water content of that 1 liter from the total water content of the orange drink:
- The amount of water in 1 liter of orange drink is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 1 \) liter.

Now, let's do the calculations:

Water in 10 liters of orange drink before spill:
\( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters

Water in 1 liter of orange drink spilled:
\( \frac{2}{3} \times 1 = \frac{2}{3} \) liters

Water in 9 liters of orange drink after spill:
\( \frac{20}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) liters

Water in 15 liters of pineapple drink:
\( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) liters

Total water in the remaining 24 liters (9 liters of orange drink + 15 liters of pineapple drink):
\( 6 + 9 = 15 \) liters

So, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 15 liters.

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up the equation based on the information that Kyle paid 75% (100% - 25% discount) of the original price. Let's denote the original price as \( P \).

The equation is:
\[ 0.75 \times P = 19.50 \]

To solve for \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now we calculate the value of \( P \):
\[ P = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to calculate the total cost of the other items she bought and subtract that from the total amount she paid. Then we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of one box of pizza to find out how many boxes she ordered.

The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

Now, let's add up the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
$12 (chicken meal) + $15 (milk) + $6 (apples) = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50, so the amount spent on pizza is:
$50 (total) - $33 (other items) = $17.

Now, we divide the amount spent on pizza by the cost of one box of pizza to find out how many boxes she ordered:
$17 / $8.50 (cost per box) = 2.

Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and their total age.

Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

Now, we solve for \(x\):
\[x = \frac{162}{18}\]
\[x = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find Allen's current age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

So, Allen's age 10 years from now will be 109.

So, the second guess is 40 + 20 = 60.

The third friend guessed 25% more than the first one's guess:
25% of the first guess is 80 * 0.25 = 20.
So, the third guess is 80 + 20 = 100.

Now we can find the average of the three guesses:

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

According to the problem, we have two equations:

1. The total number of coins is 110:
   \( S + G = 110 \)

2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins:
   \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( S \):

\( S + (S + 30) = 110 \)
\( 2S + 30 = 110 \)
\( 2S = 110 - 30 \)
\( 2S = 80 \)
\( S = 40 \)

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:

\( G = S + 30 \)
\( G = 40 + 30 \)
\( G = 70 \)

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes and then add them to the points he scored in the first 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points:
25% of 4 = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 1 point more than the 4 points he scored in the first 20 minutes:
4 points + 1 point = 5 points

Now, we add the points from both periods to get the total points:
4 points (first 20 minutes) + 5 points (second 20 minutes) = 9 points

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed. Speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time.

First, let's find out the total time John spends running each week.

He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. So, for the other two days, he runs 1.5 hours each day (which is half of 3 hours).

The total time spent running each week is:
3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours

Now, we know that he runs 60 miles a week. To find his average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:

Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

So, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

10 mph"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds, and then calculate the distance she can travel in six hours given the time spent running and walking.

First, we know that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, which is half as fast as she can run. Therefore, her running speed is twice her skipping speed:
Running speed = 3 mph * 2 = 6 mph

Since Dana can run at a rate four times faster than she can walk, we can determine her walking speed:
Walking speed = Running speed / 4 = 6 mph / 4 = 1.5 mph

Now, we need to calculate the time spent running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking over a six-hour period:
Time spent running = 6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours
Time spent walking = 6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours

Next, we calculate the distance traveled while running and walking:
Distance running = Running speed * Time spent running = 6 mph * 2 hours = 12 miles
Distance walking = Walking speed * Time spent walking = 1.5 mph * 4 hours = 6 miles

Finally, we add the distances together to get the total distance traveled:
Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips.
2. Determine the number of calories you have left to consume for the day.
3. Calculate how many calories you can consume from the chips.
4. Convert the number of calories you can consume from the chips into grams.

Step 1: Total calories in the 300g bag
Since there are 5 servings in the bag and each serving has 250 calories, the total number of calories in the bag is:
5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories

Step 2: Calories left to consume for the day
Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories, so you have:
2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories left

Step 3: Calories you can consume from the chips
You can consume up to 200 calories from the chips.

Step 4: Convert calories to grams
Since 250 calories is the amount in one serving and the bag has 5 servings in 300g, each serving is:
300g / 5 servings = 60g

Now, we need to find out how many grams are in 200 calories. Since 250 calories is 60g, we can set up a proportion to find the grams for 200 calories:
250 calories : 60g = 200 calories : x grams

Solving for x:
x grams = (200 calories * 60g) / 250 calories
x grams = 12000 / 250
x grams = 48

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total cost of making the candles and the total revenue from selling them, then subtract the cost from the revenue.

First, we determine how many pounds of beeswax are needed to make 20 candles. Since 1 pound of beeswax can make 10 candles, we need:

20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds of beeswax

The cost of supplies for 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is:

2 pounds * $10.00 per pound = $20.00

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:

20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

$40.00 (revenue) - $20.00 (cost) = $20.00 (net profit)

"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days, we need to first determine the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the average time it takes to write one article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is:
5 articles + (2/5 * 5 articles) = 5 articles + 2 articles = 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is:
2 * 7 articles = 14 articles.

Now, we can calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
5 articles (Monday) + 7 articles (Tuesday) + 14 articles (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes and then bought a package with an unknown number of Post-it notes, which we'll call \( x \). She used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 left over. The total number of Post-it notes she had before using them is the sum of the Post-it notes she started with and the ones she bought. After using 220, she had 23 left, so the equation is:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 23 + 220 - 80 \]
\[ x = 243 - 80 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the package that Candice purchased contained 163 Post-it notes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find out how many blue ties he bought, we divide the total amount spent by the cost per tie:
   Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
   Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
   Number of blue ties = 5

2. John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. So, the number of red ties he buys is:
   Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
   Number of red ties = 2 * 5
   Number of red ties = 10

3. The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. The cost of a blue tie is $40, so the cost of a red tie is:
   Cost of red tie = Cost of blue tie + (50% of Cost of blue tie)
   Cost of red tie = $40 + (0.5 * $40)
   Cost of red tie = $40 + $20
   Cost of red tie = $60

4. To find out how much he spent on red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost per red tie:
   Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of red tie
   Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60
   Total spent on red ties = $600

5. To find out the total amount spent on all ties, we add the amount spent on blue ties to the amount spent on red ties:
   Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
   Total spent on ties = $200 + $600
   Total spent on ties = $800

So, the total amount John spent on ties is $800.

"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Step 1: Total number of units in the building
Total units = Number of floors * Units per floor
Total units = 15 floors * 8 units/floor
Total units = 120 units

Step 2: Number of occupied units
Occupied units = Total units * Occupancy rate
Occupied units = 120 units * 3/4
Occupied units = 90 units

Step 3: Number of unoccupied units
Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 120 units - 90 units
Unoccupied units = 30 units

"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
2. Calculate the daily income from selling the eggs.
3. Multiply the daily income by the number of days in a week to get the weekly income.

Step 1: Number of dozens of eggs produced per day
There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to get the number of dozens.
252 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 21 dozens per day

Step 2: Daily income from selling the eggs
Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, so we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen.
21 dozens * $2 per dozen = $42 per day

Step 3: Weekly income
There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily income by 7 to get the weekly income.
$42 per day * 7 days per week = $294 per week

Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM and then calculate the time it takes for him to travel back at a different speed.

First, we calculate the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels for 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour, the distance is:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 mph * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel back 30 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour. We use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

Now, Uriah still needs to remove more weight to reach the total of 15 pounds. Let's find out how much more weight he needs to remove:

15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds

Next, we need to determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove to get rid of the remaining 7.5 pounds. Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so:

7.5 pounds / (1/2 pound per toy) = 7.5 * 2 = 15 toys

Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

"To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for both Thursday and Friday, and then find the difference between the two.

For Thursday:
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each, so the revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.
- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires at $40 each, so the revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160.
- The total revenue for Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

For Friday:
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each, so the revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
- The mechanic doesn't repair any truck tires, so the revenue from truck tires is $0.
- The total revenue for Friday is $480 + $0 = $480.

Now, we find the difference between the two days:
- The difference in revenue is $520 (Thursday) - $480 (Friday) = $40.

The mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday.

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after accounting for the weight of the driver and the empty truck. Then, we divide this remaining capacity by the weight of each box.

The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds.
The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.
The weight of each box is 15 pounds.

First, we calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge:

5000 pounds (bridge limit) - 3755 pounds (driver and truck) = 1245 pounds (remaining capacity)

Next, we determine how many boxes can be loaded:

1245 pounds (remaining capacity) / 15 pounds (per box) = 83 boxes

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 83.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency and then use that to determine the total distance she can travel with a full tank.

First, we calculate the fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg) based on the information that she traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas:

Fuel efficiency (mpg) = Distance traveled (miles) / Amount of gas used (gallons)
Fuel efficiency (mpg) = 100 miles / 4 gallons
Fuel efficiency (mpg) = 25 mpg

Now that we know her car's fuel efficiency is 25 miles per gallon, we can calculate the total distance she can travel on a full tank of 12 gallons:

Total distance (miles) = Fuel efficiency (mpg) * Tank capacity (gallons)
Total distance (miles) = 25 mpg * 12 gallons
Total distance (miles) = 300 miles

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

Given that each level has half the square footage of the level below it, and the top level (Level 4) has a square footage of 16, we can work our way down to find the square footage of the other levels.

Level 4: 16 square feet
Level 3: 16 * 2 = 32 square feet
Level 2: 32 * 2 = 64 square feet
Level 1: 64 * 2 = 128 square feet

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels to find the average:

Total square footage = Level 1 + Level 2 + Level 3 + Level 4
Total square footage = 128 + 64 + 32 + 16
Total square footage = 240 square feet

Average square footage = Total square footage / Number of levels
Average square footage = 240 / 4
Average square footage = 60 square feet

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in that time and then divide by the number of cups per bag.

First, we need to know how many days are in a year. A standard year has 365 days.

For the first 180 days, the puppy will consume 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of food for the first 180 days is:
180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups

For the remaining days of the year (365 - 180 = 185 days), the puppy will consume 2 cups of dog food per day. So, the total amount of food for the remaining 185 days is:
185 days * 2 cups/day = 370 cups

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total amount of dog food consumed in the first year:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since each bag contains 110 cups of dog food, we divide the total amount of dog food by the number of cups per bag to find out how many bags are needed:
550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. So, David does 1/4 of what Sarah does.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.

First, we calculate how much laundry David does:
David's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 4
David's laundry = 400 pounds / 4
David's laundry = 100 pounds

Next, we calculate how much laundry Raymond does:
Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
Raymond's laundry = 400 pounds / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

Now, we find the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David:
Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
Difference = 200 pounds - 100 pounds
Difference = 100 pounds

So, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds.

"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying the flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 with the cost of buying them in packages of 2 for $1.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- 18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages
- 6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- 18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages
- 9 packages * $1.00 per package = $9.00

The difference in cost between the two options is:
- $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00

So, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

"Two girls each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, so each girl got:

24 liters * (1/6) = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, they got a total of:

4 liters * 2 = 8 liters

The boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy is:

8 liters + 6 liters = 14 liters

The total amount of water was 24 liters, so the amount of water left is:

24 liters - 14 liters = 10 liters

"Charlie started with 10 stickers, then added 21 from the store and 23 from his birthday, which gives:

10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers

Then he gave away 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 to decorate a greeting card, which means he gave away a total of:

9 + 28 = 37 stickers

Subtracting the stickers he gave away from the total he had, we get:

54 - 37 = 17 stickers

So, Charlie has 17 stickers left.

"To find the combined weight of Grace and Alex, we first need to determine Alex's weight.

Grace's weight is 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs, so we calculate Alex's weight as follows:

Alex's weight = 4 * Grace's weight - 2
Alex's weight = 4 * 125 - 2
Alex's weight = 500 - 2
Alex's weight = 498 pounds

Now, we add Grace's and Alex's weights to find their combined weight:

Combined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight
Combined weight = 125 + 498
Combined weight = 623 pounds

"Let's denote the number of games won as W and the number of games lost as L. According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so we have:

W + L = 22

It is also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us:

W = L + 8

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for L:

(L + 8) + L = 22
2L + 8 = 22
2L = 22 - 8
2L = 14
L = 14 / 2
L = 7

Now that we know the number of games lost (L), we can find the number of games won (W):

W = L + 8
W = 7 + 8
W = 15

The team won 15 games.

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to apply the 10% increase to her initial monthly salary of $600 for each of the three years following her 5-year mark.

First, let's calculate her monthly salary after the first 10% increase:
$600 + ($600 * 10%) = $600 + $60 = $660

Now, we apply the 10% increase for the second year:
$660 + ($660 * 10%) = $660 + $66 = $726

And for the third year:
$726 + ($726 * 10%) = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Now, to find her annual salary, we multiply her final monthly salary by 12 (months in a year):
$798.60 * 12 = $9,583.20

Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $9,583.20.

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, which we can denote as \( 10H \).

The total number of copies sold by both is the sum of the copies sold by Harald and Marilyn, which is given as 88,000. So we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find the number of copies Harald sold, we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"To find out how much Christina will spend on gift bags, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of guests that will actually show up by accounting for the 1/4 that don't show up.
2. Determine the number of gift bags needed based on the number of guests that will show up.
3. Calculate the total cost of the gift bags.

Step 1: Number of guests that will show up
Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, 3/4 of the attendees will show up. So, we calculate 3/4 of 16 friends:
\( \frac{3}{4} \times 16 = 12 \) guests will show up.

Step 2: Number of gift bags needed
Christina needs .75 gift bags per guest, so for 12 guests, she will need:
\( 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \) gift bags.

Step 3: Total cost of the gift bags
Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost will be:
\( 9 \times 2 = 18 \) dollars.

Therefore, Christina will spend $18 on gift bags.

"To find out how many pounds of potato salad Ted the T-Rex needs to bring to the picnic, we can calculate the total amount of potato salad that will be consumed by the adults and the children.

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad the adults will eat:
- Each adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.
- So, the total for adults is 10 lbs/adult * 20 adults = 200 lbs.

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad the children will eat:
- Each child will eat half as much as an adult, which is 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs.
- There are 5 children.
- So, the total for children is 5 lbs/child * 5 children = 25 lbs.

Now, we add the total amount of potato salad for adults and children to find the total amount needed:
- Total potato salad needed = 200 lbs (adults) + 25 lbs (children) = 225 lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.

James (10 years) + 1 year = Corey's age
Corey is 11 years old.

From point 2, we can determine Amy's age:
Corey (11 years) - 2 years = Amy's age
Amy is 9 years old.

From point 1, we can determine Jackson's age:
Amy (9 years) - 5 years = Jackson's age
Jackson is 4 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Gerald's original time for the 400-meter hurdles and then calculate his improved time after his diet change.

1. Let's denote Gerald's original time as \( G \) seconds.
2. Lee's time is 2 seconds faster than Gerald's original time, so Lee's time is \( G - 2 \) seconds.
3. We are given that Lee's time is 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation \( G - 2 = 38 \).
4. Solving for \( G \), we get \( G = 38 + 2 = 40 \) seconds. This is Gerald's original time.
5. Gerald's speed improved by 10%, which means his new time is 90% of his original time. To find the new time, we calculate \( 0.90 \times G \).
6. Substituting \( G = 40 \) seconds, we get \( 0.90 \times 40 = 36 \) seconds.

So, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that the number of dogs is 60.
2. Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats is 2 times the number of dogs. So, the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120.
3. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, the number of rabbits is (number of dogs + number of cats) - 12.
4. We can calculate the number of rabbits as follows: (60 + 120) - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168.
5. To find the total number of pets, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits together: 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits).

Now, let's calculate the total number of pets:

60 + 120 + 168 = 348

(2/5) * 200 = 80 boys

2. Calculate the number of girls:
Since there are 200 students in total and 80 of them are boys, the number of girls is:
200 - 80 = 120 girls

3. Calculate the number of girls in the girl scout:
2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, so:
(2/3) * 120 = 80 girls in the girl scout

4. Calculate the number of girls not in the girl scout:
The number of girls not in the girl scout is the total number of girls minus the number of girls in the girl scout:

"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to calculate how many hours James slept. James slept 2/3 of the time Harry did, so we multiply Harry's hours by 2/3:

James' sleep = Harry's sleep * 2/3
James' sleep = 9 hours * 2/3
James' sleep = 6 hours

Now we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept to find the difference:

Difference = Harry's sleep - James' sleep
Difference = 9 hours - 6 hours
Difference = 3 hours

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the original volume of tomatoes before cooking.
2. Calculate how many cans of tomatoes were used.
3. Convert the number of cans into the number of tomatoes.

Since the sauce loses half its volume when cooked, the original volume of the tomatoes before cooking must have been twice the volume of the sauce. Freda made 32 ounces of sauce, so the original volume of the tomatoes was:

32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces

Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, so the number of cans used is:

64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans

Since each can contains three tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:

4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes

"Let's break down the information given:

- Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
- Some cars drove through in the first 15 minutes.
- 20 more cars drove through in the next 15 minutes.
- 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.

We need to find out how many cars drove through in the first 15 minutes. Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that were not part of the traffic jam is 5.

The total number of cars that were originally on the motorway is the sum of the cars that drove through, the cars that took an exit, and the cars that remained in the traffic jam. However, we are not given the number of cars that remained in the traffic jam, so we will not need that information to solve the problem.

We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ \text{Total cars} = \text{Cars that drove through} + \text{Cars that took an exit} \]
\[ 30 = (x + 20) + 5 \]

Now, we can solve for \( x \):

\[ 30 = x + 20 + 5 \]
\[ 30 = x + 25 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box by subtracting the thickness of the walls from each dimension. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

The outer dimensions of each box are:
- Length: 5 inches
- Width: 6 inches

Now, we can calculate the inner volume of one box:
Inner volume of one box = Inner length * Inner width * Inner height
Inner volume of one box = 3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches
Inner volume of one box = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:

"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate on average, we need to calculate the total area of the roll-ups each of them had and then find the average of those two areas.

For Beatrice:
- The roll-up was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- The total area for Beatrice is 2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups.

For Marcell:
- The roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- The total area for Marcell is 3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups.

Now, to find the average, we add the total areas and divide by 2 (since there are two people):

Average = (Total area for Beatrice + Total area for Marcell) / 2

"To find out how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore, we need to calculate the total distance she rowed and then determine the amount of water that entered the boat based on the given rate.

First, we need to find out how far Julia rowed in 64 seconds. We know that she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. We can set up a proportion to find out how many feet she rows in 64 seconds:

20 feet / 16 seconds = x feet / 64 seconds

Solving for x gives us:

x = (20 feet * 64 seconds) / 16 seconds
x = (1280 feet*seconds) / 16 seconds
x = 80 feet

Now that we know Julia rowed 80 feet, we can calculate the amount of water that entered the boat. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. So, for 80 feet, the amount of water is:

(2 liters / 10 feet) * 80 feet = 16 liters

Therefore, by the time Julia reached the shore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water.

- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each: 10 * $10 = $100
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each: 5 * $16 = $80

Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180

Next, we calculate the new selling price for each type of board, which is 50% higher than the original price:

- New price for 2 x 4 x 10 boards: $10 + ($10 * 50%) = $10 + $5 = $15 each
- New price for 4 x 4 x 10 boards: $16 + ($16 * 50%) = $16 + $8 = $24 each

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:

- Revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10 * $15 = $150
- Revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 * $24 = $120

Total revenue = $150 + $120 = $270

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many parts of the total mixture are sugar and how many are water, based on the given ratio of 7:13.

The total parts of the mixture are 7 (for sugar) + 13 (for water) = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined. To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we need to calculate the fraction of the total that is sugar and then apply that fraction to the total amount used.

The fraction of the total that is sugar is 7 parts out of 20 parts, which can be written as 7/20.

Now, we can calculate the amount of sugar used:

(7/20) * 120 = 7 * (120/20) = 7 * 6 = 42

So, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we first need to determine the total number of vehicles that were added to the port on that day. We know that initially, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, which totals to 10 vehicles. The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30.

The number of vehicles added on the second day is:
30 (total vehicles) - 10 (initial vehicles) = 20 vehicles

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
20 vehicles / 5 vehicles per container = 4 containers

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.
2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
4. Add both salaries to get the total salary the two were receiving four years later.

Step 1: Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.
Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. If Adrien's salary was $40,000, we can set up the equation to find Lylah's salary (L):

\( 40,000 = L + 0.30L \)
\( 40,000 = 1.30L \)
\( L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \)
\( L = 30,769.23 \) (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what he was making four years ago. So, his new salary (A_new) is:

\( A_{new} = 40,000 + 0.40 \times 40,000 \)
\( A_{new} = 40,000 + 16,000 \)
\( A_{new} = 56,000 \)

Step 3: Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
Since their salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. Her new salary (L_new) is:

\( L_{new} = 30,769.23 + 0.40 \times 30,769.23 \)
\( L_{new} = 30,769.23 + 12,307.69 \)
\( L_{new} = 43,076.92 \) (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 4: Add both salaries to get the total salary the two were receiving four years later.
Total salary (T) is:

\( T = A_{new} + L_{new} \)
\( T = 56,000 + 43,076.92 \)
\( T = 99,076.92 \)

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,076.92.

- Half the number of oranges that Morisette brought, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges

Now, let's add the fruits together:

Morisette's fruits: 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits
Kael's fruits: 10 apples + 4 oranges = 14 fruits

Total fruits: 13 fruits (Morisette) + 14 fruits (Kael) = 27 fruits

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance Rosie runs at each speed and then add them together.

First, we calculate the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles

Next, we need to find out how long she runs at 5 miles per hour. Since she has already run for 3 hours, she has 7 - 3 = 4 hours left to run at the slower speed.

Now, we calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for 4 hours:
5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 20 miles

Finally, we add the two distances together to get the total distance:
30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

So, Rosie can run 50 miles in 7 hours.

We need to find out how many spoons were in the package that Julia bought. Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as \( x \).

The total number of spoons Julia had before setting the table is the sum of the spoons she bought and the spoons her husband bought, minus the spoons she used to sample the stew:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

"To calculate the profit the hospital makes from these visits, we need to determine the total revenue and the total cost, and then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the total revenue:
- The hospital charges patients $200 per hour.
- Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, which is 24/60 = 0.4 hours.
- The revenue per patient is therefore $200 * 0.4 = $80.
- With 500 patients a day, the total revenue is $80 * 500 = $40,000.

Next, let's calculate the total cost:
- The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour.
- The cost per patient is therefore $150 * 0.4 = $60.
- With 500 patients a day, the total cost is $60 * 500 = $30,000.

Finally, we calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost

"To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate how many questions he was able to complete in the time given for each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions for each test.

For the first test:
- Mark completed 5 questions per hour.
- He had 8 hours to complete the test.
- Therefore, he completed 5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions.

Since the first test had 75 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is:
75 questions - 40 questions = 35 questions.

For the second test:
- Mark completed 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.
- Therefore, he completed 5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. We can subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total to find the number of semi-automatic cars.

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Number of semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables:

- Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) represent the number of worker bees.

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many babies as queens: \( B = 2Q \).

We also know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can write the equation:

\[ Q + B + W = 700 \]

Now, we can substitute the relationships into the equation:

\[ Q + 2Q + 2(2Q) = 700 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

Now, solve for \( Q \):

\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we have the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees:

\[ B = 2Q \]
\[ B = 2 \times 100 \]
\[ B = 200 \]

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees:

\[ W = 2B \]
\[ W = 2 \times 200 \]
\[ W = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is 400.

"To calculate how much Shawnda made, we need to determine the total number of tires she inflated and then multiply that by the cost per tire.

Bicycles have 2 tires, so 5 people on bicycles would have 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
Tricycles have 3 tires, so 3 people on tricycles would have 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
A unicycle has 1 tire, so 1 person on a unicycle would have 1 * 1 = 1 tire.

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, so the total amount made is 20 * 25 cents = 500 cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, 500 cents is equal to 500 / 100 = 5 dollars.

Therefore, Shawnda made 5 dollars that day.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many fries were in the pack when Dave bought it.

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so in total, the pigeons ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
4. After the seagull and pigeons ate, a raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 behind.

Let's denote the original number of fries as \( x \).

After Dave and the seagull ate, the number of fries left is \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).

After the pigeons ate, the number of fries left is \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).

The raccoon then stole two thirds of the remaining fries, so one third of the remaining fries were left, which is \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) \).

After the raccoon, the ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 behind. So, before the ants took a fry, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.

This means that \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6 \).

Now we can solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6 \\
x - 30 = 6 \times 3 \\
x - 30 = 18 \\
x = 18 + 30 \\
x = 48
\]

So, the original number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 48.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each 2 hours long. So, for these two days, he spends:
2 days * 2 hours/class * 2 classes/day = 8 hours

Adding the hours from all five days, we get the total number of hours Kimo spends in class each week:
9 hours (MWF) + 8 hours (TTh) = 17 hours/week

Now, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks in the semester to get the total hours for the semester:
17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours

So, in one semester, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes.

"To find the total length of all the baked goods in feet, we need to convert the lengths of the rolls and croissants from inches to feet and then add the lengths of all the items together.

There are 12 inches in a foot.

First, we convert the length of the rolls:
- Each roll is 4 inches long, so 300 rolls will be 300 * 4 inches.
- In feet, this is (300 * 4) / 12.

Next, we convert the length of the croissants:
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, so 120 croissants will be 120 * 6 inches.
- In feet, this is (120 * 6) / 12.

The baguettes are already given in feet:
- Each baguette is 2 feet long, so 60 baguettes will be 60 * 2 feet.

Now we add the lengths together to get the total length in feet.

Let's calculate:

 Rolls in feet: (300 * 4) / 12 = 1200 / 12 = 100 feet
 Croissants in feet: (120 * 6) / 12 = 720 / 12 = 60 feet
 Baguettes in feet: 60 * 2 = 120 feet

Total length in feet: 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 feet

"To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we need to calculate the total monthly requirement for all the apes and then multiply that by 2.

Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

Total monthly requirement = 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons)
Total monthly requirement = 700 bananas

For 2 months, the requirement would be:
2 months * 700 bananas/month = 1400 bananas

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance each person runs and then find the difference between the two distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each back and forth is 200 yards (100 yards there and 100 yards back).
Blake's total distance = 15 times * 200 yards/time = 3000 yards

Now, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field, which is 200 yards.
Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards there and 80 yards back, for a total of 160 yards per time.
Kelly runs this 34 times.
Kelly's total distance = 200 yards + (34 times * 160 yards/time) = 200 yards + 5440 yards = 5640 yards

Now, we find the difference between the two distances:
Difference = Kelly's total distance - Blake's total distance = 5640 yards - 3000 yards = 2640 yards

The winner runs 2640 yards farther than the loser.

"To find the tank's water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow the changes in water depth from Monday to Tuesday and then from Tuesday to Wednesday.

1. On Monday, the depth of the water is 17 feet.
2. On Tuesday, the depth of the water is 17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet.
3. On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of the depth on Tuesday, which is 2/3 * 24 feet.

Now, let's calculate the depth for Wednesday:

2/3 * 24 feet = 16 feet

So, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"To find out how many fish Anakin and Locsin caught, we need to calculate the total for each of them and then add those totals together.

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which is 10 - 5 = 5 starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which is 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which is 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish

Now, let's add up the totals for each of them:

Anakin's total:
10 (starfish) + 6 (sea horses) + 3 (clownfish) = 19 fish

Locsin's total:
5 (starfish) + 3 (sea horses) + 5 (clownfish) = 13 fish

Combined total:
19 (Anakin's fish) + 13 (Locsin's fish) = 32 fish

So, Anakin and Locsin were able to catch a total of 32 fish.

"To find the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the effect of the 20% price increase that occurs every two months over the 36-month period.

First, let's determine how many times the price will increase over 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, we divide 36 by 2:

36 months / 2 months per increase = 18 increases

Each time the price increases, it is multiplied by 1 plus the percentage increase. A 20% increase is the same as multiplying by 1.20 (100% + 20% = 120% = 1.20).

So, the original price of $20 will be multiplied by 1.20, 18 times. This can be expressed as:

Final price = Original price * (1 + percentage increase) ^ number of increases
Final price = $20 * (1.20) ^ 18

Now, let's calculate the final price:

Final price = $20 * (1.20) ^ 18

Using a calculator to find (1.20) ^ 18:

(1.20) ^ 18 ≈ 38.3376

Now, multiply this by the original price:

Final price ≈ $20 * 38.3376
Final price ≈ $766.752

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final price is:

$766.75

"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then sum them up.

1. The cost of one red car is $4, so the cost of 5 red cars is:
   5 red cars * $4/red car = $20

2. The cost of one action figure is $5, so the cost of 3 action figures is:
   3 action figures * $5/action figure = $15

3. The cost of the doll is the same as 3 action figures, which is:
   3 action figures * $5/action figure = $15

Now, we add up the costs of all the toys:
$20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50

The total worth of all the toys is $50.

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the cost of hiring the accountant with the income she would lose by doing her taxes herself.

If Jackie does her taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work at $35 per hour. The total lost income would be:
3 hours * $35/hour = $105

The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

The difference in cost between doing the taxes herself (in terms of lost income) and hiring the accountant is:
$105 (lost income) - $90 (accountant's fee) = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to calculate the total number of eggs required for 15 Spanish flans and then determine how many babysitting sessions are needed to gather that many eggs.

First, we calculate the total number of eggs needed for the flans:
15 flans * 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs

Next, we determine how many babysitting sessions are required to get 45 eggs, given that she receives 9 eggs per session:
45 eggs / 9 eggs/session = 5 sessions

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to gather enough eggs for 15 Spanish flans.

"Let's denote Seth's current age as S and Brooke's current age as B. According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write:

S = 2B

In 2 years, Seth's age will be S + 2 and Brooke's age will be B + 2. The sum of their ages at that time will be 28, so we can write:

(S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second one:

(2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:

S = 2B = 2 * 8 = 16

So Seth is currently 16 years old.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants, and then add them together.

The cost of the hat is given as $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so:
Jacket cost = 3 * Hat cost
Jacket cost = 3 * $25
Jacket cost = $75

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so:
Pants cost = (Hat cost + Jacket cost) / 2
Pants cost = ($25 + $75) / 2
Pants cost = $100 / 2
Pants cost = $50

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
Total cost = Hat cost + Jacket cost + Pants cost
Total cost = $25 + $75 + $50
Total cost = $150

"To calculate how much Jessica will pay in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum on all her debts, we first need to determine the total minimum monthly payment and then calculate 50% more than that amount. After that, we multiply the increased monthly payment by 12 to get the annual amount.

1. Calculate the total minimum monthly payment:
   Student loans: $300
   Credit card: $200
   Mortgage: $500
   Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

2. Calculate 50% more than the total minimum monthly payment:
   50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500
   Increased monthly payment = $1000 + $500 = $1500

3. Calculate the annual payment:
   Annual payment = Increased monthly payment * 12 months
   Annual payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes per potato = 90 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes to cut all the potatoes:
60 potatoes * 5 seconds per potato = 300 seconds

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert the cutting time to minutes:
300 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 5 minutes

Now, we add the peeling time and the cutting time together to get the total time:
90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

- Total cost per gallon: $3 + $2 = $5
- Revenue per glass: $0.50
- Number of glasses per gallon: 20
- Revenue per gallon: 20 glasses * $0.50/glass = $10

Now, let's calculate the profit per gallon:
- Profit per gallon: Revenue per gallon - Cost per gallon = $10 - $5 = $5

To make a $25 profit, we need to find out how many gallons they need to sell:
- Number of gallons to make $25 profit: $25 / $5 per gallon = 5 gallons

Jan's age two years ago = 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Now, we can find out how old Mark was two years ago using the second piece of information:
Mark's age two years ago = (1/2 * Jan's age two years ago) + 5
Mark's age two years ago = (1/2 * 28) + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 14 + 5

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two events and then compare them.

1. The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die:
There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die (4, 5, and 6). So the probability is 3 out of 6, which simplifies to 1/2 or 50%.

2. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:
There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6). The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3 out of 6, which simplifies to 1/2 or 50%. The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 1/2. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling two even numbers in a row) is the product of their individual probabilities: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 or 25%.

Now, we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We can do this by finding the ratio of the two probabilities and then converting that ratio to a percentage.

The ratio of the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 to the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:

50% / 25% = 2

This means that it is 2 times more likely to roll a number greater than 3. To express this as a percentage, we can say it is 100% more likely (since 2 times more likely is the same as 100% more likely).

"To find out how many rats are in each cage, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats, hamsters, and rabbits, and then use the information to determine the number of rats.

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters and rabbits:

- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of pieces of straw for the hamsters is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces.
- There is a pen of rabbits with 20 pieces of straw.

Now, let's add the straw given to the hamsters and rabbits to find out how much straw is used for them:

\(50 + 20 = 70\) pieces of straw.

Since 160 pieces of straw have been distributed in total, we can subtract the straw used for the hamsters and rabbits to find out how much straw is given to the rats:

\(160 - 70 = 90\) pieces of straw for the rats.

We know that each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, and the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \(r\). The total number of rats is then \(3r\), and the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \(3r \times 6\).

We can set up the equation:

\(3r \times 6 = 90\)

Solving for \(r\):

\(18r = 90\)

\(r = \frac{90}{18}\)

\(r = 5\)

So, there are 5 rats in each cage.

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
r = the annual interest rate (decimal)
n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year
t = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for

In this case, the interest is compounded monthly, so n = 12. The annual interest rate is 2% per month, which is 24% per year, so r = 0.24. The time t is 3 months, which is 3/12 or 0.25 years. The principal P is $100.

Let's calculate:

A = 100(1 + 0.24/12)^(12*0.25)

First, calculate the monthly interest rate:
0.24/12 = 0.02

Then, calculate the number of times interest is compounded over the 3 months:
12 * 0.25 = 3

Now, we can plug these values into the formula:
A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3

Now, calculate the value inside the parentheses and then raise it to the power of 3:
A = 100(1.02)^3

Now, calculate the value of (1.02)^3:
A = 100 * 1.061208

Finally, multiply by the principal amount:
A = 106.1208

Rounding to the nearest cent, Mandy should give Benedict $106.12.

"Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

The cost price (CP) for the trader for each bag is the sum of the purchase price and the transportation cost, which is \( $20 + $2 = $22 \) per bag.

The selling price (SP) for the trader is \( $30 \) per bag.

The profit made on each bag is the selling price minus the cost price, which is \( $30 - $22 = $8 \) per bag.

The total profit made by the trader is the profit per bag multiplied by the number of bags, which is \( $8 \times x \).

We know the total profit is \( $400 \), so we can set up the equation:

\[ 8x = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:

\[ x = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags.

2. The cost of the food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
3. The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, we add up all the costs:
Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66
Total cost = $102

Since there are three friends, we divide the total cost by 3 to find out how much each friend paid:
Amount each friend paid = Total cost / 3
Amount each friend paid = $102 / 3
Amount each friend paid = $34

"To find out how many pounds of insects ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per week for ten ducks.
2. Divide the weekly total by 7 to find the daily requirement.

Step 1: Total weekly requirement for ten ducks
Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, so for ten ducks:
3.5 pounds/duck/week * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week

Step 2: Daily requirement for ten ducks
There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the weekly total by 7 to find the daily requirement:
35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of trees Tom plants each year, then determine the total number of trees after 10 years, and finally account for the 30% that die.

1. Net number of trees planted each year: 10 (planted) - 2 (chopped down) = 8 trees per year.
2. Total number of trees after 10 years: Starting with 50 trees, plus 8 trees per year for 10 years = 50 + (8 * 10) = 50 + 80 = 130 trees.
3. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die: 30% of 130 = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees die.
4. Number of trees left: 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

"Let's break down the sequence of events to find out how many pink and white plastic flamingos Sue had on her front yard by noon on Sunday.

1. On Friday morning, Sue had 18 pink plastic flamingos.
2. On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the pink flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos.
3. These 6 flamingos were then painted white and put back out on the yard. So, by the end of Saturday, Sue had 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.
4. On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. This means Sue now had 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos and still 6 white flamingos.

Now, to find out how many more pink plastic flamingos there were than white plastic flamingos by noon on Sunday, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos:

30 (pink) - 6 (white) = 24

"To find out how much 8 pens will cost, we first need to determine the cost of one pen. We know that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. 

The cost of a pencil is $1.20 and the cost of an eraser is $0.30. So, the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser is:

$1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

This means that one pen costs $1.50. Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

$1.50 * 8 = $12.00

Therefore, 8 pens will cost $12.00.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months, which is 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, to find the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has, we add the initial number of cards to the cards collected in each of the three months:

Initial cards: 20
First month: 60
Second month: 40
Third month: 200

Total cards = 20 + 60 + 40 + 200

Total cards = 320

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate the total earnings from both publishers.

First, we need to determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we divide the total number of sentences by 2:

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Next, we calculate the earnings from Publisher A. Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, we multiply the number of sentences by the rate:

500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents.

Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so the rate from Publisher B is:

2 * 5 cents/sentence = 10 cents/sentence.

Now, we calculate the earnings from Publisher B:

500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents.

Finally, we add the earnings from both publishers to find the total weekly earnings:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents.

"To calculate how much money John made in the year after winning the award, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the increased salary due to the 5% raise.

1. Calculate the annual salary before the raise:
   $2000 per week * 52 weeks = $104,000

2. Calculate the 5% raise on the annual salary:
   5% of $104,000 = 0.05 * $104,000 = $5,200

3. Calculate the new annual salary after the raise:
   $104,000 + $5,200 = $109,200

4. Add the one-time monetary reward to the new annual salary:
   $109,200 + $5,000 = $114,200

"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the cheese used for each meal and then sum it all up.

For the sandwiches:
- He ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
- Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
So, the total cheese used for sandwiches is 7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices.

For the omelets:
- He ate omelets for breakfast 3 days.
- Each omelet used 1 more slice than each sandwich, so 2 slices + 1 slice = 3 slices per omelet.
So, the total cheese used for omelets is 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices.

For the macaroni and cheese:
- He used 8 slices of cheese for the entire dish.

Now, we add up all the cheese used:
- Cheese for sandwiches: 14 slices
- Cheese for omelets: 9 slices
- Cheese for macaroni and cheese: 8 slices

Total cheese used = 14 slices + 9 slices + 8 slices = 31 slices.

"To find out what score Brinley needs on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the lowest score from the first five tests.
2. Calculate the total points Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93 over the five highest scores.
3. Calculate the sum of the four highest scores from the first five tests.
4. Determine the score needed on the sixth test to reach the total points required for an average of 93.

First, let's identify the lowest score from the first five tests:
The scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71.

Next, we calculate the total points needed for an average of 93 over five tests:
Total points needed = 93 * 5 = 465

Now, we calculate the sum of the four highest scores from the first five tests:
Sum of four highest scores = 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367

Finally, we determine the score needed on the sixth test:
Score needed on sixth test = Total points needed - Sum of four highest scores
Score needed on sixth test = 465 - 367 = 98

Brinley needs to score 98 on the sixth test to get an average of 93 after removing the lowest score.

"To calculate the total kilometers Michael rode, we need to break it down into two parts: the first four weeks and the following three weeks.

For the first four weeks:
- He rides 5 times a week.
- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- So, in one week, he rides 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rides 4 * 125 = 500 kilometers.

For the next three weeks:
- He rides 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- So, in one week, he rides 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rides 3 * 120 = 360 kilometers.

Adding the two parts together:
- Total kilometers = 500 (first four weeks) + 360 (next three weeks) = 860 kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40g. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g per chocolate bar = 1000g

Next, we are told that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, each candied apple weighs:
40g / 2 = 20g

Since there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20g per candied apple = 1600g

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag:
1000g (chocolate bars) + 1600g (candied apples) = 2600g

Therefore, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.
On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, we add the number of cakes from each day together:
4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76 cakes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, and a dozen is 12, half a dozen would be 6 plates.

Total cost of half a dozen plates = 6 plates * $6000 per plate
Total cost of half a dozen plates = $36000

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.

Total cost of twenty dozen cups = Total cost of half a dozen plates - $1200
Total cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200
Total cost of twenty dozen cups = $34800

Since twenty dozen cups are 20 * 12 = 240 cups, we can now find the cost of each cup.

Cost of each cup = Total cost of twenty dozen cups / Number of cups
Cost of each cup = $34800 / 240
Cost of each cup = $145

So, the total cost of buying each cup is $145.

"To find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then determine how much more money she needs after accounting for her savings and babysitting earnings.

The total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is:
$30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70

Sara already has $10 saved, so the remaining amount she needs is:
$70 (total cost) - $10 (savings) = $60

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so her total earnings from babysitting are:
4 * $5 = $20

Now, we subtract her babysitting earnings from the remaining amount she needs:
$60 (remaining amount) - $20 (babysitting earnings) = $40

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn mowed:
$40 / $4 = 10

Sara must mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

According to the problem, we have two equations:

1. The total number of eggs collected per day is 42, which is the sum of the eggs produced by the red and white chickens:
   \( 3R + 5W = 42 \)

2. There are two more white chickens than red chickens:
   \( W = R + 2 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( R \):

\( 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \)
\( 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \)
\( 8R + 10 = 42 \)
\( 8R = 42 - 10 \)
\( 8R = 32 \)
\( R = 32 / 8 \)
\( R = 4 \)

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle and then divide that by his walking speed.

The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:
P = 2 * (length + width)

Given the dimensions of the park:
Length (L) = 6 miles
Width (W) = 1.5 miles

We can calculate the perimeter as follows:
P = 2 * (6 + 1.5)
P = 2 * 7.5
P = 15 miles

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours (T) he spends walking, we use the formula:
T = Distance / Speed

So, the time spent walking is:
T = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
T = 5 hours

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the edge of the park.

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the first day: 100 customers.
2. Determine the number of customers on the second day: 100 customers + 50 more = 150 customers.
3. Calculate the total number of customers for the first two days: 100 customers + 150 customers = 250 customers.
4. Subtract the total number of customers for the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day to find the number of customers on the third day: 500 customers - 250 customers = 250 customers.

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250.

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. We know that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the small pool was \( S + 4 \times 4 \) gallons (since 16 gallons have leaked out in the last 4 minutes), and the amount of water in the big pool was \( B + 4 \times 4 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To find Janeth's remaining balance after paying $165 a month for 12 months, we first need to calculate the total amount she owes, including the 10% interest.

The total amount owed is the principal plus the interest:
Total amount owed = Principal + (Principal * Interest Rate)
Total amount owed = $2000 + ($2000 * 0.10)
Total amount owed = $2000 + $200
Total amount owed = $2200

Next, we calculate the total amount she will have paid after 12 months:
Total amount paid = Monthly Payment * Number of Months
Total amount paid = $165 * 12
Total amount paid = $1980

Now, we can find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount owed:
Remaining balance = Total amount owed - Total amount paid
Remaining balance = $2200 - $1980
Remaining balance = $220

"To solve the problem, let's start by determining the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years old.
2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

Now, we need to calculate their ages in three years:

- Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
- Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.
- Zack will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old.

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages together and divide by 3:

Average age = (Harriet's age + Adrian's age + Zack's age) / 3
Average age = (24 + 66 + 45) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

Together, they can place:
4 pieces/minute (Kalinda) + 2 pieces/minute (Mom) = 6 pieces/minute

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to place all 360 pieces at this combined rate:
360 pieces / 6 pieces/minute = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the time to hours:
60 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 1 hour

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"First, we calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest when Ashlyn first visited the farm:

30% of 120 watermelons = 0.30 * 120 = 36 watermelons

After taking these 36 watermelons home, the number of watermelons remaining on the farm is:

120 watermelons - 36 watermelons = 84 watermelons

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest:

3/4 of 84 watermelons = 0.75 * 84 = 63 watermelons

After harvesting these 63 watermelons, the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested is:

84 watermelons - 63 watermelons = 21 watermelons

So, the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

"To calculate the total cost Mark pays for everything, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

1. Cost of the cars: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000
2. Tax on the cars: 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000
3. Registration fees: 12 cars * $1,000 per car = $12,000

Now, we add all these costs together to get the total amount paid:

Total cost = Cost of the cars + Tax on the cars + Registration fees
Total cost = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000
Total cost = $276,000

"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many shells Kylie collected on Monday.
2. Calculate how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday based on the information that she collected 2 times more shells than she did on Monday.

Step 1: On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells, and Kylie collects 5 more than Robert. So, Kylie collects:
20 shells (Robert's collection) + 5 shells = 25 shells

Step 2: On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. So, she collects:
25 shells (Monday's collection) * 2 = 50 shells

Therefore, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday.

"To find out how many penguins are still left sunbathing, we need to calculate the number of penguins that jumped in the ocean and the number that went inside the cave to eat their dinner, and then subtract these from the total number of penguins.

There are 36 penguins in total.

One-third of the penguins jump in and swim in the ocean:
36 / 3 = 12 penguins

Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner:
36 / 3 = 12 penguins

Now, we subtract the penguins that left from the total:
36 - 12 (swimming) - 12 (eating) = 12 penguins

So, 12 penguins are still left sunbathing.

"To find out how many vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate the total number of tomatoes he and his girlfriend will consume per week.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so in a week (7 days), he eats:
6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats:
42 tomatoes/week / 2 = 21 tomatoes/week

Together, they eat:
42 tomatoes/week (Steve) + 21 tomatoes/week (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week

Now, if a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week is:
63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine/week = 21 vines

So, Steve needs 21 vines.

"To find out how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of slices needed: Since each of John's 20 friends will have 4 slices, we multiply 20 friends by 4 slices per friend.
2. Determine the number of slices per pizza: Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions.
3. Divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza to find out how many pizzas are required.

Let's do the math:

Total slices needed = 20 friends * 4 slices/friend = 80 slices
Slices per pizza = 8

Number of pizzas needed = Total slices needed / Slices per pizza = 80 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 10 pizzas

John needs to order 10 pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial pens Ram buys and the additional pens he can create by mixing the ink from the empty ones.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. So, from the 25 empty pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.
3. After using these 5 new pens, he will have 5 empty pens again, which he can mix to make 1 more pen.
4. After using this 1 pen, he will have 1 empty pen, which is not enough to make another pen.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to use is the initial 25 pens plus the 5 new pens plus the 1 additional pen.

25 (initial pens) + 5 (first batch of new pens) + 1 (second batch of new pens) = 31 pens

"To find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we can start by determining the age of each girl based on the information provided.

Jessa's age is given as 20 years old.

Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan's age is:
20 years (Jessa's age) + 5 years = 25 years

Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is:
25 years (Joan's age) - 2 years = 23 years

Now, we can find the sum of their ages:
20 years (Jessa) + 25 years (Joan) + 23 years (Mary) = 68 years

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 68 years.

"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Subtract the number of students who went out through exit A from the total to find the remaining students.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
4. Subtract the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students to find the number who went out through exit C.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Number of students who went out through exit A:
   30% of 1000 = 0.30 * 1000 = 300 students

2. Remaining students after exit A:
   1000 - 300 = 700 students

3. Number of students who went out through exit B:
   3/5 of the remaining 700 students = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students

4. Remaining students who went out through exit C:
   700 - 420 = 280 students

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. John has 54 candies.
2. John has twice as many candies as Robert, so Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.
3. James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

Now, to find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

54 (John's candies) - 33 (James's candies) = 21

So, John has 21 more candies than James.

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of pen pals Mike is still in contact with.
2. Calculate the total number of letters he receives each week.
3. Calculate the total number of pages he needs to write in response.
4. Determine the total time he spends writing those pages.
5. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Step 1: Mike was a pen pal with 5 people and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he is still in contact with:
5 - 2 = 3 people

Step 2: Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, so the total number of letters he receives each week is:
3 * 2 = 6 letters

Step 3: Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he needs to write in response is:
6 * 5 = 30 pages

Step 4: Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing those pages is:
30 * 6 = 180 minutes

Step 5: To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
180 / 60 = 3 hours

So, Mike spends 3 hours writing letters each week.

"To calculate the remaining minutes in Jason's phone plan, we need to consider the following:

1. Jason's phone plan includes 1000 minutes per month.
2. He has a 15-minute call with his boss every day.
3. He has used an additional 300 minutes for calls to other people this month.
4. The month has 30 days.

First, we calculate the total minutes used for the daily calls with his boss:
15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Next, we add the extra minutes used for calls to other people:
450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the monthly plan to find out how many minutes are left:
1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

So, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan for this month.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries from Griffin, so Griffin has 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes 2 * 5 = 10 fries from Griffin. Now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.
4. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle took, so Colby takes 5 - 3 = 2 fries from Griffin. Now Griffin has 9 - 2 = 7 fries left.
5. Ginger gives Griffin some fries, and after that, Griffin has 27 fries.

To find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin, we need to calculate the difference between the number of fries Griffin had after Colby took some and the number of fries Griffin had at the end.

So, Ginger gave Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

"To find the number of fish in each aquarium, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( f \).

The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Since there are the same number of fish in each aquarium, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).

So we can write the equation as:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ f = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the number of cookies each of them ate and then convert that into calories.

First, let's find out how many cookies Sue ate on each day:

- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate \( 2 \times 13 = 26 \) cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate:

- Sue's total cookies: \( 20 + 26 = 46 \)
- Her sister's total cookies: \( 5 + 13 = 18 \)

Next, we convert the number of cookies into calories:

- Sue's total calories: \( 46 \times 200 = 9200 \) calories
- Her sister's total calories: \( 18 \times 200 = 3600 \) calories

"To find out how many animals Rick killed, we need to calculate the number of wolves and cougars he killed today and add them to the number he killed last night.

From the information given:
- Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.
- Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars.
- Today, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, which means he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Now, since Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, he killed 3 * 12 = 36 wolves today.

Adding the numbers from both nights:
- Wolves: 10 (last night) + 36 (today) = 46 wolves
- Cougars: 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27 cougars

The total number of animals Rick killed is the sum of the wolves and cougars:

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first determine how many times Anne went down the slide. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, who went down 30 times.

First, we calculate 30% of Mitchel's 30 slides:
30% of 30 = 0.30 * 30 = 9

Now, we subtract that from Mitchel's total to find Anne's total:
Anne's slides = Mitchel's slides - 30% of Mitchel's slides
Anne's slides = 30 - 9 = 21

Now that we know Anne went down the slide 21 times, we can calculate how many times Robert went down the slide, which is 4 times as much as Anne:
Robert's slides = 4 * Anne's slides
Robert's slides = 4 * 21 = 84

1. Calculate the brokerage fee:
   Brokerage fee = 5% of $350,000
   Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $350,000
   Brokerage fee = $17,500

2. Calculate the transfer fee:
   Transfer fee = 12% of $350,000
   Transfer fee = 0.12 * $350,000
   Transfer fee = $42,000

3. Calculate the total cost of the house:

3. Time to cook the chicken: 5 minutes less than the time it took to warm up the oil to 400 degrees.

Let's calculate the time for step 2:
40% of 20 minutes is 0.40 * 20 = 8 minutes.
So, the time to heat the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees is 20 minutes + 8 minutes = 28 minutes.

"To find out how much the real estate agent spent on buying all the ads, we need to calculate the total cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads separately and then add them together.

The cost of the newspaper ads is calculated as follows:
50 newspaper ads * $5 per newspaper ad = $250

The cost of the television ads is calculated as follows:
15 television ads * $75 per television ad = $1125

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total cost:
$250 (newspaper ads) + $1125 (television ads) = $1375

The real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads.

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to add the number of M&Ms in each of the three bags.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, we add the M&Ms from all three bags together:
300 (first bag) + 312 (second bag) + 150 (third bag) = 762 M&Ms.

"To find the total number of windows in both houses, we can break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. Calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house:
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - There are 3 bedrooms in one house.
   - So, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is 3 bedrooms * 2 windows/bedroom = 6 windows.

2. Add the additional windows in one house that are not connected to bedrooms:
   - There are 4 additional windows in one house.
   - So, the total number of windows in one house is 6 windows (from bedrooms) + 4 windows (additional) = 10 windows.

3. Since John has 2 houses, we need to double the number of windows in one house to get the total number of windows in both houses:
   - Total windows in both houses = 10 windows/house * 2 houses = 20 windows.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
The collar takes a tenth of the body, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.
The rosette takes twice as many as the collar, which is 90 * 2 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. This includes the body, the collar, the rosette, and the two sleeves. Let's denote the number of stitches for one sleeve as S. Therefore, the total number of stitches for the two sleeves is 2S.

The equation for the total number of stitches is:
900 (body) + 90 (collar) + 180 (rosette) + 2S (two sleeves) = 1800

Now we can solve for S:
900 + 90 + 180 + 2S = 1800
1170 + 2S = 1800
2S = 1800 - 1170
2S = 630
S = 630 / 2
S = 315

Each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part of his role and then sum them up.

1. The solo song has 54 lines, and all of them are his lines.
2. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 54 * 2 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are his, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.
3. The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are his, so he has to memorize 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, we add up all the lines he has to memorize:
- Solo song: 54 lines
- First scene: 36 lines
- Second scene: 48 lines

Total lines to memorize: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138

"To find out how many hours it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the total time for each type of hole and then convert the total time into hours.

First, we calculate the time for the small holes:
30 small holes * 3 minutes per small hole = 90 minutes

Next, we calculate the time for the large holes:
15 large holes * 10 minutes per large hole = 150 minutes

Now, we add the time for both types of holes to get the total time in minutes:
90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
240 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 4 hours

"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we need to add 10 years to each of their current ages and then sum those future ages.

Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as K. According to the information given:

M + K = 20

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be K + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

(M + 10) + (K + 10) = M + K + 20

Since we know that M + K = 20, we can substitute this into the equation:

20 + 20 = 40

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40.

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

According to the problem, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write the first equation as:
\[ R = 6S \]

In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write the second equation as:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now we can substitute the value of \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expanding the equation, we get:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can set up the following equation:

Let the number of spots on a mamba be \( x \).
Then the number of spots on a cobra is \( 2x \).

We are given that a cobra has 70 spots, so:
\( 2x = 70 \)
\( x = 70 / 2 \)
\( x = 35 \)

So, a mamba has 35 spots.

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park:

Total spots on cobras = Number of cobras * Spots per cobra
Total spots on cobras = 40 * 70
Total spots on cobras = 2800

Total spots on mambas = Number of mambas * Spots per mamba
Total spots on mambas = 60 * 35
Total spots on mambas = 2100

Now, we add the total spots of cobras and mambas to get the combined total spots:
Combined total spots = Total spots on cobras + Total spots on mambas
Combined total spots = 2800 + 2100
Combined total spots = 4900

Finally, we need to find half the number of spots they all have combined:
Half the number of spots = Combined total spots / 2
Half the number of spots = 4900 / 2
Half the number of spots = 2450

"To find out how many dollars Maddy will spend on pizza, we need to calculate the total number of people, the number of pizzas required, and then the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total number of people:
- There are 12 team members.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 guests.
- There are 3 coaches.

So, the total number of people is 12 (team members) + 24 (guests) + 3 (coaches) = 39 people.

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3:
- 39 people / 3 people per pizza = 13 pizzas.

Finally, we calculate the total cost:
- 13 pizzas * $15 per pizza = $195.

Therefore, Maddy will spend $195 on pizza.

"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones and then determine how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 of them, so the total length of the topaz gemstones is:
8 gemstones * 1 inch/gemstone = 8 inches

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, so the length available for the sterling silver beads is:
25 inches (total length) - 8 inches (topaz gemstones) = 17 inches

Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, so the number of sterling silver beads that can fit into the 17 inches is:
17 inches / (1/4 inch/bead) = 17 * 4 beads = 68 beads

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. In the second week, they each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week.

So, in the second week:
- Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories
- Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories
- Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories

Now, let's add the stories from both weeks for each of them:
- Alani's total: 20 (first week) + 40 (second week) = 60 stories
- Braylen's total: 40 (first week) + 80 (second week) = 120 stories
- Margot's total: 60 (first week) + 120 (second week) = 180 stories

Finally, we add all their stories together to get the total number of stories written by the family:
60 (Alani) + 120 (Braylen) + 180 (Margot) = 360 stories

"To find the number of 5-star rows, we first need to calculate the total number of stars in the 8-star rows and the 6-star rows, and then subtract that from the total number of stars on the flag.

There are three rows of 8 stars, so:
3 rows * 8 stars/row = 24 stars

There are two rows of 6 stars, so:
2 rows * 6 stars/row = 12 stars

Now, we add the stars from the 8-star rows and the 6-star rows:
24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars

The total number of stars on the flag is 76, so the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:
76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars

Since each 5-star row contains 5 stars, the number of 5-star rows is:
40 stars / 5 stars/row = 8 rows

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip, we first need to calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones and then divide that by the weight capacity of one truck.

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

The delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds each. To find out how many trucks are needed, we divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight capacity of one truck:
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks

Since you can't have a fraction of a truck, and all flagstones must be transported, we need to round up to the nearest whole number if there's any remainder. In this case, the division is exact, so we need exactly 3 trucks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles. We know the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

The formula to calculate time is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the slow lane, the distance is 480 miles and the speed is 30 miles per hour. Plugging these values into the formula gives us:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

"To find out how many medals have been given out for counting, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
2. Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. This is 22 (Ali's medals) + 17 (Izzy's medals) = 39 medals.
3. Since the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out, we can set up the equation: 39 * 10 = total medals given out.

Now, we can calculate the total number of medals given out:

39 * 10 = 390

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:

40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

Finally, we divide the remaining chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars/child

"To calculate Susan's earnings, we need to determine the total time she spends working, excluding her half-hour pause.

The total time from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this is equivalent to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Susan takes a half-hour pause, which is 30 minutes. Therefore, the total working time is 180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes.

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10, which gives us 150 / 10 = 15 intervals.

Since she earns $5 for each interval, her total earnings are 15 intervals * $5/interval = $75.

Now, in the fourth round, each player who has over 20 points gets an extra point:

- Mike has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point: 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point: 18 points.
- Tony has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point: 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Finally, we add up all the points to get the total:

"To calculate the total amount John pays for the driving service in a year, we need to consider both the mileage cost and the monthly bonus.

First, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- John's work is 30 miles away, so a round trip is 60 miles.
- He goes to work 5 days a week, so in a week, he travels 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week.
- Over 50 weeks, he travels 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.
- At a rate of $2 per mile, the cost for the miles driven is 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000/year.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the monthly bonus:
- He gives a $150 bonus per month.
- There are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus for the year is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year.

Now, we add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to get the total annual cost:
- Total cost = cost of miles driven + total bonus
- Total cost = $30,000/year + $1,800/year = $31,800/year.

Therefore, John pays $31,800 a year for the driving service.

"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand that each piece of paper, when folded, will have four pages: the front and back of the folded halves. Therefore, a single sheet of paper will contain pages 1 and 2 on one side, and pages 31 and 32 on the other side when unfolded.

Since the tabloid has 32 pages, we can calculate the number of sheets by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages per sheet:

32 pages / 4 pages per sheet = 8 sheets

"To find out how much money Elise earned in the second year, we need to determine how many books she sold in that year. We know the following:

- Total number of books: 250
- Price per book: $20
- Number of unsold books: 50
- Number of books sold in the current (third) year: 45
- Number of books sold in the first year: twice the number sold in the third year

First, let's calculate the number of books sold in the first year:
Number of books sold in the first year = 2 * number of books sold in the third year
Number of books sold in the first year = 2 * 45
Number of books sold in the first year = 90

Now, let's calculate the total number of books sold over the three years:
Total books sold = total number of books - number of unsold books
Total books sold = 250 - 50
Total books sold = 200

Next, we can find out how many books were sold in the second year by subtracting the number of books sold in the first and third years from the total number of books sold:
Number of books sold in the second year = total books sold - (number of books sold in the first year + number of books sold in the third year)
Number of books sold in the second year = 200 - (90 + 45)
Number of books sold in the second year = 200 - 135
Number of books sold in the second year = 65

Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year by multiplying the number of books sold in the second year by the price per book:
Total amount earned in the second year = number of books sold in the second year * price per book
Total amount earned in the second year = 65 * 20
Total amount earned in the second year = 1300

- He earns $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings from the hourly wage are 50 * $10 = $500.

Next, let's add the weekly bonus:
- Since the company performed well, he gets a $300 bonus each week.

Now, let's calculate his total weekly earnings:
- His total weekly earnings are $500 (hourly wage) + $300 (bonus) = $800.

April typically has 4 weeks, so we will calculate his earnings for 4 weeks:
- His total earnings for April are 4 * $800 = $3200.

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April.

Since he beats 16 people, the number of people he loses to is the total number of people he arm wrestles minus the number he beats:

\( 20 - 16 = 4 \)

So, John loses to 4 people.

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning:
   Two-thirds of 60 loaves are sold in the morning.
   \( \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \) loaves

2. Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales:
   \( 60 - 40 = 20 \) loaves

3. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon:
   Half of the remaining 20 loaves are sold in the afternoon.
   \( \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \) loaves

So, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide the total weight loss by the number of weeks to find the weekly weight loss:

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Now, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will also lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

To lose the same 8 pounds that Joey loses in 4 weeks, we need to calculate how many 4-week periods it will take for Sandy to lose 8 pounds:

8 pounds / 2 pounds per 4 weeks = 4

Since each period is 4 weeks, we multiply the number of periods by 4 weeks:

4 * 4 weeks = 16 weeks

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

"To calculate the total savings, we need to determine the savings on the ice cream and the milk separately and then add them together.

For the ice cream:
- Original price per tub: $13
- New price per tub: $11
- Savings per tub: $13 - $11 = $2
- Total savings for 2 tubs: 2 * $2 = $4

For the milk:
- Discount per packet: $0.5
- Total savings for 4 packets: 4 * $0.5 = $2

Total savings for both items:
- Total savings: $4 (ice cream) + $2 (milk) = $6

"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after drinking Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum for fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of new arms and legs separately and then add them together.

An extra arm grows every 3 days, so in 15 days, the number of new arms will be:
15 days / 3 days per arm = 5 new arms

An extra leg grows every 5 days, so in 15 days, the number of new legs will be:
15 days / 5 days per leg = 3 new legs

Adding the new arms and legs together gives us the total number of new limbs:
5 new arms + 3 new legs = 8 new limbs

"Theo's total expenses can be calculated as follows:

1. Cost of 6 business suits: 6 * $100 = $600
2. Cost of 3 suitcases: 3 * $50 = $150
3. Cost of the flight ticket: $700 + (5 * $100) = $700 + $500 = $1200

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
Total expenses = Cost of suits + Cost of suitcases + Cost of flight ticket
Total expenses = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the amount he has left to spend on gifts is:
Amount for gifts = Total money - (Total expenses + Savings)
Amount for gifts = $6000 - ($1950 + $2000)
Amount for gifts = $6000 - $3950
Amount for gifts = $2050

The amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is $2050."
"To calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to first determine the daily egg consumption and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Three people eat three eggs each day, so they consume:
3 people * 3 eggs/person = 9 eggs

The remaining two people eat two eggs each day, so they consume:
2 people * 2 eggs/person = 4 eggs

The total daily consumption of eggs by the family is:
9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs

Now, to find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
13 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 91 eggs/week

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Cera is currently 46 years old.
2. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
3. Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
4. Currently, Noah is 20 + 6 = 26 years old.
5. Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age, so the population was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.
6. The population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, so the current population is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

The population of Chile now is 120,000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. According to the problem, there are twice as many players on the offense, which would be 2D, and half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, which would be D/2.

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. So we can write the equation:

D + 2D + D/2 = 105

Combining like terms, we get:

3.5D = 105

To find the number of players on the defense, we divide both sides of the equation by 3.5:

D = 105 / 3.5
D = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To find out how many people show up for Martha's party, let's break down the information:

1. Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, which is 2 * 6 = 12 people.
2. She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, which is 3 * 4 = 12 people.
3. The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24 people.
4. 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
5. 1/4 of the number of people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 people.

Now, let's subtract the people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

24 (total invited) - 8 (illness) - 2 (commitments) = 14 people.

So, 14 people show up for Martha's party.

"To find the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has after buying from Johanna and receiving from his father.
2. Multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to get the total weight.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of marbles.
- Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
- He already had 50 marbles in the store.
- His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

So, the total number of marbles Solomon has is:
20 (from Johanna) + 50 (already in the store) + 8 (from his father) = 78 marbles.

Step 2: Calculate the total weight.
- Each marble weighs 2kgs.
- The total weight is 78 marbles * 2kgs/marble = 156kgs.

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 156kgs.

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls and nongendered children based on the number of boys, and then add all the numbers together.

Given:
- The classroom has 30 boys.
- There are 3 times as many girls as boys.
- There are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys.

Let's calculate the number of girls:
Number of girls = 3 * Number of boys
Number of girls = 3 * 30
Number of girls = 90

Now, let's calculate the number of nongendered children:
Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * Number of boys
Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * 30
Number of nongendered children = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children
Total number of children = 30 + 90 + 3
Total number of children = 123

"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left, which means 1/4 of 40 people left the party. That's 40 / 4 = 10 people who left.

If 22 men stayed at the party, that means 25 (initial number of men) - 22 (men who stayed) = 3 men left the party.

Since 10 people left in total and 3 of them were men, the remaining 10 - 3 = 7 people who left must have been women.

Initially, there were 15 women, so the number of women left at the party is 15 (initial number of women) - 7 (women who left) = 8 women.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes and then calculate the total number of boxes needed for both Jam and Meg's pencils.

First, let's find out how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can set up the following equation to find the number of pencils in each box:

3 * (number of pencils in each box) + 2 loose pencils = 26 pencils

Let's solve for the number of pencils in each box:

3 * (number of pencils in each box) = 26 - 2
3 * (number of pencils in each box) = 24
(number of pencils in each box) = 24 / 3
(number of pencils in each box) = 8

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Now, let's find out how many boxes are needed for Meg's 46 pencils. We can divide the total number of Meg's pencils by the number of pencils that fit in one of Jam's boxes:

46 pencils / 8 pencils per box = 5.75 boxes

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we'll need to round up to the next whole number, which means Meg needs 6 boxes to store all her pencils.

Now, we add the number of boxes Jam has to the number of boxes Meg needs:

Jam's boxes: 3
Meg's boxes: 6
Total boxes needed: 3 + 6 = 9

So, Jam and Meg need a total of 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To find out how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to calculate the total amount of liquid added to the coffee, which includes both the ice cubes and the cream.

First, we determine how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we divide 65 by 13 to find the number of ice cubes:

65 degrees / 13 degrees per ice cube = 5 ice cubes

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:

5 ice cubes * 12 milliliters per ice cube = 60 milliliters weaker

Additionally, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. So, the total amount by which the coffee is weakened is:

60 milliliters (from ice cubes) + 15 milliliters (from cream) = 75 milliliters

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of junior programmers.
2. Calculate the number of senior programmers.
3. Calculate the monthly salary of a senior programmer.
4. Calculate the total monthly salary for all junior programmers.
5. Calculate the total monthly salary for all senior programmers.
6. Add the total monthly salaries of junior and senior programmers to get the total amount paid to all programmers.

Let's start with step 1:

1. The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees. Since the company has 100 employees, the number of junior programmers is:
   \( \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \)

2. The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers:
   \( \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \)

3. The monthly salary of a senior programmer is $400 more than a junior programmer, who is paid $2000 per month:
   \( \text{Monthly salary of a senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \)

4. The total monthly salary for all junior programmers is:
   \( \text{Total for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \)

5. The total monthly salary for all senior programmers is:
   \( \text{Total for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \)

6. The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in, so the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

We know that after the second stop, there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop. So we can set up the following equation:

\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = 20 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 5 - 7 + 8 = 20 \]
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal.

"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to determine the remaining percentage of charge needed:

100% - 60% = 40%

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. To find out how many minutes it will take to charge 40 percentage-points, we multiply the number of percentage-points by the time it takes to charge one percentage-point:

40 percentage-points * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes

Now, to convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%.

On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43. They used their rewards, and the coupon took off twice the amount of the rewards. 

Coupon value = 2 * $4 = $8.

Now, let's calculate the total discount applied to this shopping trip:

Total discount = Rewards value + Coupon value
Total discount = $4 + $8 = $12.

Finally, we subtract the total discount from the amount spent to find out how much the customer paid:

Amount paid = Amount spent - Total discount
Amount paid = $43 - $12 = $31.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chickens and cows Farmer Brown has, and then calculate the total number of legs.

Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( Ch \).

According to the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of animals is 60, so \( C + Ch = 60 \).
2. There are twice as many chickens as cows, so \( Ch = 2C \).

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( C \):
\( C + 2C = 60 \)
\( 3C = 60 \)
\( C = 20 \)

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\( Ch = 2C \)
\( Ch = 2 \times 20 \)
\( Ch = 40 \)

Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. So, the total number of legs is:

\( 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \) meters

The total distance Tyson covered in June is:
180000"
"Juice Box A costs 4 dollars. 

Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it costs 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.

Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it costs 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C: 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

"To calculate the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have, we need to multiply the number of tables by the number of legs for each type of table and then add the two results together.

For the 40 tables with 4 legs each:
40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs

For the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs

Now, we add the two totals together:
160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310.

"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband, and then subtract that from the total number of cookies in the bag.

Jenny's son gets 4 cookies a day for 5 days a week, so he eats:
4 cookies/day * 5 days/week = 20 cookies/week

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days a week, so he eats:
1 cookie/day * 7 days/week = 7 cookies/week

Together, they eat:
20 cookies/week (son) + 7 cookies/week (husband) = 27 cookies/week

The bag has 36 cookies, so the number of cookies Jenny eats is:
36 cookies - 27 cookies = 9 cookies

Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find out how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts with a 40% discount, we first need to calculate the total cost of the shirts without the discount. Then we apply the discount to find the final price.

The cost of one shirt is $30, so the cost of two shirts is:
2 * $30 = $60

The discount is 40%, so the discount amount on the total cost is:
40% of $60 = 0.40 * $60 = $24

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final price:
$60 - $24 = $36

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

"To find out what percentage more the factory is making per day now, we need to calculate the daily revenue from tractors and silos, and then compare the two.

First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractors:
10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silos:
5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

Now, we find the difference in daily revenue:
$1100/day - $1000/day = $100/day

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original daily revenue from tractors and multiply by 100:
($100/day / $1000/day) * 100 = 10%

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

"To calculate the total amount of money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to add up the monthly costs and then multiply by 12 (the number of months in a year).

First, we calculate the monthly cost of food:
$25 per week * 4 weeks per month = $100 per month

Next, we add the monthly costs of treats and medicine:
$100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220 per month

Finally, we calculate the yearly cost:
$220 per month * 12 months per year = $2640 per year

So, the total amount of money Madeline spends on her dog per year is:

$2640"

"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots she donates and then subtract that from the number of plant pots she originally bought.

The school asked for 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses. This means they asked for:
- 30 plant pots for the daisies
- 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses

The total number of plant pots the school asked for is:
30 (daisies) + 60 (roses) = 90 plant pots

April had already bought 100 plant pots. After donating the 90 plant pots to the school, she has:
100 - 90 = 10 plant pots left over

"To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to first determine the total time he spent on vacation. We know that the time he spent watching shows (3 shows * 2 hours each) and the time he spent boating and swimming is 30% of his total vacation time.

Let's calculate the time spent on these activities:
- Time spent boating: 6 hours
- Time spent swimming: 6 / 2 = 3 hours
- Time spent watching shows: 3 * 2 = 6 hours

Total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows:
6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (shows) = 15 hours

This 15 hours is 30% of his total vacation time. We can set up the equation to find the total vacation time (T):
15 hours = 0.30 * T

Now we solve for T:
T = 15 hours / 0.30
T = 50 hours

Now that we know the total vacation time, we can calculate the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time:
Time spent sightseeing = 0.40 * T
Time spent sightseeing = 0.40 * 50 hours
Time spent sightseeing = 20 hours

So, John spent 20 hours sightseeing.

"To find out how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and add that to her current savings. Then we subtract this total from the cost of the phone.

First, let's calculate her earnings from the first job:
$10 per hour * 20 hours = $200

Next, her earnings from the second job:
$5 per hour * 15 hours = $75

Now, let's add her earnings from both jobs:
$200 + $75 = $275

We add this to her current savings:
$80 + $275 = $355

Finally, we subtract this total from the cost of the phone to find out how much more she needs to save:
$400 - $355 = $45

So, Annabelle still needs to save $45.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The height of the shortest tree is 6 feet.
2. The height of the second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet.
3. The combined height of the shortest and the second tree is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.
4. The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree, so it is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars and teddy bears that Dean bought.

The cost of 6 toy cars at $2 each is:
6 * $2 = $12

The cost of 5 teddy bears at $1 each is:
5 * $1 = $5

The total cost of the toys is:
$12 + $5 = $17

Dean initially had $28 and spent $17, so he has:
$28 - $17 = $11

After his mother gives him an extra $10, he has:
$11 + $10 = $21

So, Dean has $21 left.

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for one person (Morgan) to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then we can see how many people can be accommodated within the $90 budget.

The cost for one person is:
- Mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- Go-karts (2 rides): $10 * 2 = $20

Total cost for one person: $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Now, we need to see how many people can be accommodated with the $90 budget. Since the budget is for Morgan and her friends, we need to include Morgan in the count.

$90 / $30 = 3

This means that the budget can cover the cost for 3 people, which includes Morgan. Therefore, the number of friends she can invite is:

3 - 1 (Morgan) = 2

Morgan can invite 2 friends.

"Marisa gets $5 every day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops every day. The cost of the lollipops per day is:

4 lollipops * $0.25 per lollipop = $1.00

So, the amount she saves each day is:

$5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00

If she saves for 5 days, the total amount saved is:

$4.00 * 5 days = $20.00

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Billy starts with $10.
2. He buys candy at $1.5 per pound.
3. After buying the candy, he has some change left.
4. He spends half of his change on gumballs, which cost $0.05 each.
5. He bought 40 gumballs.

First, we need to find out how much money Billy spent on the gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05 and he bought 40, the total cost for the gumballs is:

40 gumballs * $0.05/gumball = $2.00

Since this $2.00 is half of his change, the total change he had after buying the candy is:

$2.00 * 2 = $4.00

Now, we know that Billy had $4.00 left after buying the candy. Since he started with $10, the amount he spent on candy is:

$10.00 - $4.00 = $6.00

Finally, to find out how many pounds of candy he bought, we divide the amount he spent on candy by the cost per pound:

$6.00 / $1.5/pound = 4 pounds

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver is 5 years less than twice his son's age. We can write this as an equation:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 2x = 45 + 5 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the train travels in one complete trip between the three cities, then multiply that by the number of trips it makes in a day, and finally determine how many days it can operate before reaching the 18,000-mile service interval.

1. Calculate the distance from the third city to the first city:
   The combined distance from the first to the second and then to the third city is 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles.
   The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than 175 miles, which is 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.

2. Calculate the total distance for one complete trip:
   The total distance for one trip is the sum of the distances between all three cities: 75 miles + 100 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.

3. Calculate the total distance traveled in one day:
   Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is 300 miles * 3 = 900 miles.

4. Calculate the number of days before service is needed:
   The train needs service every 18,000 miles, so we divide 18,000 miles by the daily distance to find out how many days it can go without service: 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.

The train goes 20 days between services.

"To find out how many pounds of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to determine the amount of stuffing required for a collie bed. Since a collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed, we can calculate it as follows:

Average stuffing for a collie bed = (Stuffing for a Rottweiler bed + Stuffing for a chihuahua bed) / 2
Average stuffing for a collie bed = (8 pounds + 2 pounds) / 2
Average stuffing for a collie bed = 10 pounds / 2
Average stuffing for a collie bed = 5 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds:

Total stuffing for chihuahua beds = 4 beds * 2 pounds/bed
Total stuffing for chihuahua beds = 8 pounds

Total stuffing for collie beds = 3 beds * 5 pounds/bed
Total stuffing for collie beds = 15 pounds

Total stuffing needed = Total stuffing for chihuahua beds + Total stuffing for collie beds
Total stuffing needed = 8 pounds + 15 pounds
Total stuffing needed = 23 pounds

"To calculate the total time John spent on his trip, we need to calculate the time for each leg of the journey and then add them together.

First, we calculate the time it took for John to drive to his friend's house with the detour. The total distance for this part of the trip is 200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles. Since he drives at a speed of 70 mph, the time it takes is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time to friend's house = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

Next, we calculate the time it took for John to drive back home. The distance for this part of the trip is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph, so the time it takes is:

Time back home = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Now, we add the times for both parts of the trip to get the total time:

Total time = Time to friend's house + Time back home
Total time = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

The total time for the trip is 6 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks be \( x \).
2. According to the problem, \( x = 3 \) (since 3 customers were kicked out for not wearing masks).
3. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4x - 5 \).
4. The number of people kicked out for physical violence is \( 3 \) times the number of shoplifters, which is \( 3(4x - 5) \).
5. The total number of people kicked out is the sum of those kicked out for not wearing masks, shoplifting, physical violence, and other reasons, which is \( 50 \).

Let's denote the number of people kicked out for other reasons as \( y \).

The equation representing the total number of people kicked out is:

\[ x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) + y = 50 \]

Now we can substitute \( x = 3 \) into the equation:

\[ 3 + (4 \cdot 3 - 5) + 3(4 \cdot 3 - 5) + y = 50 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3 + (12 - 5) + 3(12 - 5) + y = 50 \]
\[ 3 + 7 + 3 \cdot 7 + y = 50 \]
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 + y = 50 \]
\[ 31 + y = 50 \]

Now, solve for \( y \):

\[ y = 50 - 31 \]
\[ y = 19 \]

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is \( 19 \).

Erin's current points = Sara's points * 3
Erin's current points = 8 * 3
Erin's current points = 24

Now, to find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we subtract 14 from her current points:

3. **Pins cost**: 2 seniors * $5/pin = $10
4. **Cords cost**: 1/4 of 44 seniors are officers, so 44 / 4 = 11 officers * $12/cord = $132

Now, we add all the costs together:

$880 (frames) + $176 (etching) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198

The total amount spent on the senior gifts is $1198.

"To find out how many apples Lucy picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples she picked each day and then sum them up.

First, we know that Lucy sold all the apples she picked on Monday for $56. Since she sells apples at $4 each, we can calculate the number of apples she sold on Monday by dividing the total money by the price per apple:

Number of apples sold on Monday = Total money from Monday / Price per apple
Number of apples sold on Monday = $56 / $4
Number of apples sold on Monday = 14

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, so:

Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 2 * Number of apples picked on Tuesday
Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 2 * 12
Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 24

Now, we can sum up the apples picked over the three days:

Total apples picked = Apples picked on Monday + Apples picked on Tuesday + Apples picked on Wednesday
Total apples picked = 14 + 12 + 24

"To calculate the monthly payment Karan has to make, we need to first determine the total amount of interest that will be charged over the five months and then add that to the principal to find the total amount to be repaid. After that, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

The formula to calculate simple interest is:

\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Where:
- Principal (P) is the amount borrowed, which is $3,650.
- Rate (R) is the annual interest rate, which is 10% or 0.10.
- Time (T) is the time the money is borrowed for, in years. Since the loan is for five months, we need to convert this to years by dividing by 12 (the number of months in a year).

Let's calculate the interest first:

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount to be repaid:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]

Finally, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{5} \]

Let's do the math:

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \approx 152.08 \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08 \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, Karan has to pay $760.42 per month.

   Total profit = Total revenue - Cost of supplies
   Total profit = $36 - $18 = $18

4. Number of hours to sell all the lemonade:
   Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour.
   Number of hours = Total cups / Cups per hour
   Number of hours = 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours

5. Profit per hour:
   Profit per hour = Total profit / Number of hours
   Profit per hour = $18 / 9 hours = $2/hour

So, Millie will make a profit of $2 per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand.

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up the following equation based on the information given:

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first.

He sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, so he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left.

The amount of land left is given as 12.8 hectares, so we can write:

\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To find \( x \), we can solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]

\[ x = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52
Number of girls = 0.5 * 52
Number of girls = 26

On the day of the performance, only the female members are performing, so we start with 26 girls. However, half of these girls can't make it because their bus breaks down:

Number of girls who can't make it = 50% of 26
Number of girls who can't make it = 0.5 * 26
Number of girls who can't make it = 13

So, the number of girls who are able to perform is:

Number of girls performing = 26 - 13
Number of girls performing = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so we add these 3 to the number of girls performing:

Total number of people performing = Number of girls performing + Number of teachers
Total number of people performing = 13 + 3
Total number of people performing = 16

"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of the 5 test scores he received. We do this by adding all the scores together and then dividing by the number of scores.

Here are the scores: 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

Let's add them up:

65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400

Now, we divide the total by the number of tests, which is 5:

400 / 5 = 80

So, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu and then add that to the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson.

First, we find out how many messages Mr. Yu receives. Since he gets 1/3 as many messages as Ms. Thompson, we calculate:

Messages to Mr. Yu = 1/3 * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = 1/3 * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we add the messages delivered to both teachers to get the total:

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

"To determine how much money David saves, we need to calculate the total cost for both David and Dasha to ride all 9 rides and then find the difference between their costs.

First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha:
- Each ride costs 2 ride tickets.
- Each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs 2 * $2 = $4.
- For 9 rides, Dasha will pay 9 * $4 = $36.

Now, let's calculate the cost for David:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.

The amount David saves is the difference between what Dasha pays and what David pays:
- Dasha's cost: $36
- David's cost: $30
- Savings: $36 - $30 = $6

David saves $6.

"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we can start by setting up the ratio and the total number of popsicles in terms of a variable. Let's say the number of popsicles Betty has is 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has is 6x, where x is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles they have together is the sum of Betty's and Sam's popsicles, which is given as 165. So we can write the equation:

5x + 6x = 165

Combining like terms, we get:

11x = 165

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 165 / 11
x = 15

Now that we have the value of x, we can find out how many popsicles each person has:

Betty has 5x popsicles, which is 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6x popsicles, which is 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number Sam has:

90 - 75 = 15

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To calculate the savings, we need to determine the total cost of the streaming services and then subtract that from the cost of the cable package.

First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu and Disney Plus each cost $10 a month, but with a 20% discount for bundling.

The discount on Hulu and Disney Plus is 20% of $20 (since each is $10 and he has both), which is:
0.20 * $20 = $4

So, the discounted cost for Hulu and Disney Plus together is:
$20 - $4 = $16

Now, let's add the cost of Netflix to the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:
$10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26

The total cost of the cable package is $60 a month. So, the savings by cancelling the cable package and switching to streaming services is:
$60 (cable) - $26 (streaming services) = $34

Therefore, Tim saves $34 a month by cancelling his cable package.

"To find the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the time spent recording the song, which is half the time spent writing it.
2. Convert all times to the same unit (minutes in this case).
3. Calculate the total work time.
4. Calculate the percentage of the total work time spent editing.

Step 1: Time spent recording the song
Time spent writing the song = 4 hours
Time spent recording the song = 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours

Step 2: Convert all times to minutes
Time spent writing the song in minutes = 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes
Time spent recording the song in minutes = 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
Time spent editing the song = 90 minutes (already in minutes)

Step 3: Calculate the total work time
Total work time = Time writing + Time recording + Time editing
Total work time = 240 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes
Total work time = 450 minutes

Step 4: Calculate the percentage of the total work time spent editing
Percentage spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total work time) * 100
Percentage spent editing = (90 / 450) * 100
Percentage spent editing = 0.2 * 100
Percentage spent editing = 20%

"To find out how many books Wendy will need, we first need to determine the number of books that can be placed in a shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns. This is simply the product of the number of rows and the number of columns:

6 rows * 6 columns = 36 books

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double this number. So we first double the number of books:

2 * 36 books = 72 books

Then we add 20 more books to this number:

72 books + 20 books = 92 books

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to add the cards she initially made, the cards her dad brought, and the cards she received, and then subtract the cards she passed out.

Erica made 20 cards.
Her dad brought 2 boxes of 15 cards each, so that's 2 * 15 = 30 cards.
She received 17 cards from family and friends.

So, the total number of cards Erica had is:
20 (made) + 30 (dad's) + 17 (received) = 67 cards.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, which is a total of:
24 + 5 = 29 cards.

Now, we subtract the cards she passed out from the total number of cards she had:
67 (total) - 29 (passed out) = 38 cards.

Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

"To find out how many slices are left, we need to calculate how many slices Bill and Mark received and then subtract those and the slices Jenny ate from the total.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill:
12 slices * 1/3 = 4 slices

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark:
12 slices * 1/4 = 3 slices

Jenny eats 2 slices herself.

Now we add up all the slices that have been given away or eaten:
4 slices (Bill) + 3 slices (Mark) + 2 slices (Jenny) = 9 slices

Finally, we subtract this number from the total number of slices to find out how many are left:
12 slices - 9 slices = 3 slices

"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we first need to determine the ages of Beth and Alice based on the information given.

If Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, then Beth is:
30 years + 5 years = 35 years old.

Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, Alice is:
35 years + 7 years = 42 years old.

Now, to find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we subtract Erica's age from Alice's age:
42 years - 30 years = 12 years.

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12 years.

"To calculate the builder's earnings for a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a week.
2. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a month.
3. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a year.
4. Multiply the number of days worked in a year by the daily pay rate.

Step 1: The builder works 6 days every week.
Step 2: The builder works 4 weeks every month, so the number of days worked in a month is 6 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 24 days/month.
Step 3: There are 12 months in a year, so the number of days worked in a year is 24 days/month * 12 months/year = 288 days/year.
Step 4: The builder gets paid $50 every day, so the annual earnings are 288 days/year * $50/day.

- One zebra with 36 stripes: 36 stripes
- One zebra with half as many stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: 36 / 2 = 18 stripes

Now, we add up all the stripes:
34 (from the two zebras) + 36 (from the one zebra) + 18 (from the last zebra) = 88 stripes

Next, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras to find the average:
88 stripes / 4 zebras = 22 stripes per zebra

The average number of stripes on the zebras is 22.

"To find out how much Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required and then multiply by their respective costs.

First, we determine how many sandwiches are needed to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people served per sandwich:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches, Tyson will need:

5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Now we calculate the cost for the meat and cheese:

5 pounds of meat * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
5 pounds of cheese * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

Finally, we add the cost of the meat and cheese together to get the total cost:

$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

So, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Allan has 40 cannolis in his house.
2. There is twice as much corn as cannolis, so he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.
3. Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so he now has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.
4. He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he now has, so he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.
5. The new total of corns is 80 (original) + 60 (bought) = 140 corns.
6. The combined total of corns and cannolis is 140 (corns) + 100 (cannolis) = 240.

"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 5,000 steps. He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, before his jog, he had completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. This means that before his jog, he had 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps completed or in progress.

Since he had 6,000 steps before his jog and 8,000 steps after his jog, the number of steps he took during his jog is 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

"To find out how many minutes early Toby will be, we need to calculate the total time it will take him to read the book and then add the time it takes to get to the airport. We can then subtract this total time from the 60 minutes he has before he needs to be at the airport.

First, we calculate the total number of words in the book:
45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Next, we determine how long it will take Toby to read the book:
9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes to get to the airport:
30 minutes (reading) + 10 minutes (travel) = 40 minutes

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees who continued working in June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Add the total payments for May and June to get the final amount.

Step 1: Total payment for May
- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hours per week: 40
- Pay rate: $15 per hour
- Weeks in a month: 4 (assuming a standard 4-week month for simplicity)

Total payment for May = Number of employees * Hours per week * Pay rate * Weeks in a month
Total payment for May = 40 * 40 * $15 * 4

Step 2: Number of employees in June
- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees continued working.

Number of employees in June = 3/4 * Number of employees in May
Number of employees in June = 3/4 * 40

Step 3: Total payment for June
- The number of hours per week and pay rate remain the same.

Total payment for June = Number of employees in June * Hours per week * Pay rate * Weeks in a month
Total payment for June = (3/4 * 40) * 40 * $15 * 4

Step 4: Total payment for May and June
Total payment for May and June = Total payment for May + Total payment for June

Now, let's calculate the numbers:

Total payment for May = 40 * 40 * $15 * 4 = 40 * 40 * 60 = 96,000

Number of employees in June = 3/4 * 40 = 30

Total payment for June = 30 * 40 * $15 * 4 = 30 * 40 * 60 = 72,000

Total payment for May and June = 96,000 + 72,000 = 168,000

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $168,000.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and subtract that from the $10 her parents gave her.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means the first pound costs $3 and the second pound costs $3 * 1/2 = $1.50. So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, the mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

Then, the 4 magnets cost $0.25 each, so the total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
Total cost = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells + Cost of magnets
Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00
Total cost = $7.00

Finally, we subtract the total cost from the $10 Sally had:
Money left = $10 - Total cost
Money left = $10 - $7.00
Money left = $3.00

So, Sally has $3.00 left.

"To find out how much Tim spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks after the discount and then add the cost of the finale firework.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the two packages of fireworks before the discount:
- The first package costs $400.
- The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it costs $400 * 2 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages before the discount is:
$400 + $800 = $1200.

Now, let's apply the 20% discount to the two packages:
- A 20% discount means he pays 80% of the total cost.
- The discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is $1200 * 0.20 = $240.
- The cost after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the two packages:
$960 + $150 = $1110.

So, the total amount Tim spent is:

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog. We know that 1% of the candles are expected to explode because Marcy markets them as 99% guaranteed not to explode. Out of these exploding candles, 5% also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

First, we calculate the number of candles that are expected to explode:
1% of 50000 candles = 0.01 * 50000 = 500 candles

Next, we calculate the number of these exploding candles that also smell like wet dog:
5% of 500 candles = 0.05 * 500 = 25 candles

So, 25 candles are expected to both explode and smell like wet dog.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the discount amount and then apply it to the regular price of the blouses.

The regular price for each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount on the rack. To find the discount amount for one blouse, we calculate 30% of $20:

Discount amount per blouse = 30% of $20
                           = 0.30 * $20
                           = $6

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to find the discounted price for one blouse:

Discounted price per blouse = Regular price - Discount amount
                            = $20 - $6
                            = $14

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so we multiply the discounted price of one blouse by 4 to find the total cost:

Total cost of the discounted blouses = Discounted price per blouse * Number of blouses
                                    = $14 * 4
                                    = $56

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Joanne gathers an unknown number of apples from the average trees, let's call this number \( x \).
4. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
5. Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
6. Joanne's sister gathers no apples from the average trees.
7. The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500.

We can set up the equation to represent the total number of apples gathered:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]
\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

From this, we can set up the following system of equations:

\( C + D = 180 \) (each animal has one head)
\( 2C + D = 304 \) (camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump)

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of \( C \) and \( D \).

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( D \):

\( (2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180 \)
\( 2C + D - C - D = 124 \)
\( C = 124 \)

Now that we have the number of camels, we can substitute \( C \) back into the first equation to find \( D \):

\( 124 + D = 180 \)
\( D = 180 - 124 \)
\( D = 56 \)

"To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the trip into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

First 4 days: 200 kilometers/day * 4 days = 800 kilometers
Next 2 days: 30% of 800 kilometers = 0.30 * 800 kilometers = 240 kilometers
Next 1 day: 0 kilometers (he wasn't traveling)
Second week (7 days): 300 kilometers/day * 7 days = 2100 kilometers

Now, we add up all the distances:
800 kilometers (first 4 days) + 240 kilometers (next 2 days) + 0 kilometers (next 1 day) + 2100 kilometers (second week) = 3140 kilometers

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers.

"To find out how big Timothy's locker is, we can start by determining the size of Zack's locker since we know the size of Peter's locker and the relationship between Zack's and Peter's lockers.

Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, so Zack's locker is 4 times the size of Peter's locker. Since Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can calculate Zack's locker size as follows:

Zack's locker size = 4 * Peter's locker size
Zack's locker size = 4 * 5 cubic inches
Zack's locker size = 20 cubic inches

Now, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so Timothy's locker is twice the size of Zack's locker. We can calculate Timothy's locker size as follows:

Timothy's locker size = 2 * Zack's locker size
Timothy's locker size = 2 * 20 cubic inches
Timothy's locker size = 40 cubic inches

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to determine the elevation of the ledge where the comb landed and then calculate the difference between that elevation and Oliver's current elevation.

Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet. So, the elevation of the ledge where the comb landed is:

10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To reach the comb, Oliver must climb to the 6,000 feet elevation. The number of feet Oliver must climb is:

6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet

"To find out how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the amounts he received from the two banks to his initial capital.

The first bank gave him $4000.
The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.
He initially had $5000 in capital.

So, the total capital he has now is the sum of the initial capital and the amounts from both banks:
$5000 (initial capital) + $4000 (first bank) + $8000 (second bank) = $17000.

"To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of cats on the rock.
2. Subtract the number of cats carried away by the four boats.
3. Calculate the number of cats that ran after the mouse.
4. Subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats to find out how many are left.

Let's do the math:

1. Initial number of cats: 50
2. Cats carried away by the four boats: 4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats
3. Remaining cats after the boats left: 50 - 20 = 30 cats
4. Cats that ran after the mouse: 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats
5. Cats left on the rock: 30 - 18 = 12 cats

So, the final number of cats left on the rock is:

"To calculate the total cost of the streaming service for 2 years, we need to break down the costs into the different periods and then sum them up.

1. The first 6 months at the special introductory deal: 6 months * $8/month = $48
2. The next 8 months at the normal price: 8 months * $12/month = $96
3. The remaining time in the 2-year period (24 months - 6 months - 8 months = 10 months) at the increased price: 10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, we add up all the costs:
$48 (first 6 months) + $96 (next 8 months) + $140 (remaining 10 months) = $284

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The tattered jeans cost $28.
2. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so they cost $28 - $6 = $22.
3. Cole saved a total of $6.
4. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, which is 1/3 * $6 = $2.
5. The rest of the savings, which is 2/3 of the total savings, came from the tattered jeans, so that's 2/3 * $6 = $4.

Now, to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we need to add the savings to the sale prices of the jeans to get their original prices.

6. The original price of the tattered jeans is $28 (sale price) + $4 (savings) = $32.
7. The original price of the jogger jeans is $22 (sale price) + $2 (savings) = $24.

Finally, we subtract the original price of the tattered jeans from the original price of the jogger jeans to find the difference:

8. $24 (original price of jogger jeans) - $32 (original price of tattered jeans) = -$8.

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost, which implies a positive difference. Since we have a negative number, it means the tattered jeans originally cost more than the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans actually cost $8 less, not more. Therefore, the answer to the question as stated is $0, because the jogger jeans do not cost more than the tattered jeans.

The capacity of the minibusses is:
6 minibusses * 30 employees/minibus = 180 employees

The capacity of the minivans is:
10 minivans * 15 employees/minivan = 150 employees

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to get the total number of employees that can join the day trip:

3 homemade feeders * 30 birds per feeder = 90 birds

The total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is:
3 store-bought feeders * 20 birds per feeder = 60 birds

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is:
90 birds (from homemade feeders) + 60 birds (from store-bought feeders) = 150 birds

"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for the dinner she ordered, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

The cost of the bagel is $4.

The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup, we calculate 25% of $4 and add it to the original price of the bagel:
25% of $4 = 0.25 * $4 = $1
So, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is:
1/2 * $4 = $2.

Now, we add up the cost of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost:
$5 (soup) + $4 (bagel) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to determine how many cards he sold and then calculate the total number of cards, including the ones he kept.

First, we know that Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 left over, so he must have made $150 from selling his cards.

The price per card is $1.5, so the number of cards he sold can be calculated as:

Number of cards sold = Total money made / Price per card
Number of cards sold = $150 / $1.5
Number of cards sold = 100

Since Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, the 100 cards he sold represent the remaining 2/3 of his collection. We can set up the following equation to find the total number of cards (T):

2/3 * T = 100

To find T, we solve for T:

T = 100 * (3/2)
T = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The caterer was initially told to prepare for 36 guests.
2. Most guests would eat one hot dog, but the caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hot dogs.
3. Half of 36 guests is 18 guests, so the caterer prepared 18 extra hot dogs for those 18 guests to have a second one.
4. The total number of hot dogs prepared is 36 (one for each guest) + 18 (for the second hot dog for half of the guests) = 54 hot dogs.
5. However, 40 guests showed up, and all of them wanted a second hot dog.
6. For 40 guests to each have two hot dogs, the caterer would need 40 * 2 = 80 hot dogs.
7. Since the caterer only prepared 54 hot dogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is the difference between the number of hot dogs needed for everyone to have a second one and the number of hot dogs prepared: 80 - 54 = 26 guests.

"To find the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names, we first need to calculate the number of letters in her sister's name.

Indras has 6 letters in her name. Half of the letters in Indras' name would be 6 / 2 = 3 letters. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than this, so her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:

6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13

"To find out how much Charlotte's order was after the 20% discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.
2. Calculate the discount amount.
3. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to get the final price.

Let's do the math:

1. The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
2. The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
3. The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost before the discount is:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

The discount is 20% of the total cost:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

The final price after the discount is:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

So, Charlotte's order was $132.00.

"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and then subtract the amount of money she already has.

The cost of the skipping rope is $6.
The cost of the board game is $11.
The cost of the playground ball is $2.

The total cost of the items is:
$6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Dora has saved $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16, so the total amount of money she has is:
$2 + $16 = $18

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost of the items:
$19 - $18 = $1

Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many gallons of gas are in one container.
2. Calculate how many gallons 1/4 of a container is.
3. Convert the gallons to pints, knowing that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints.

Step 1: Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, each container has:
15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Step 2: Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so she needed:
3 gallons * 1/4 = 0.75 gallons

Step 3: To find out how many pints 0.75 gallons is, we convert gallons to pints:
0.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how much money George had initially. We know that he spent $5 and had 1% of his money left. This means that the $5 he spent is 99% of his total money, because 100% - 1% = 99%.

Let's denote the total amount of money George had as \( M \). We can set up the following equation:

\[ 0.99M = 5 \]

To find \( M \), we divide both sides by 0.99:

\[ M = \frac{5}{0.99} \]

\[ M = \frac{500}{99} \]

\[ M \approx 5.0505 \]

So, George had approximately $5.05 initially.

Next, we need to calculate how much George spent on the 3 bags of chips. Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, so 3 bags would cost:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount he spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

\[ 5.00 - 1.20 = 3.80 \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so we divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find out how many he bought:

\[ \frac{3.80}{0.75} = \frac{380}{75} \]

\[ \frac{380}{75} = 5.0666... \]

Since George cannot buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 5.

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

"Rory's cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces. Each piece, therefore, weighs 20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece.

Rory and her mom each have a piece, so they have eaten 2 pieces in total. The weight of the cake they have eaten is 2 pieces * 2.5 ounces/piece = 5 ounces.

The remaining cake is the original weight minus the weight of the pieces eaten, which is 20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces.

"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we first need to calculate the total number of oranges that Sitti and Juris have together. Then we will divide that total by the number of people sharing the oranges, which is Sitti, Juris, and their 6 other friends, making a total of 8 people.

Total oranges = Sitti's oranges + Juris's oranges
Total oranges = 34 + 22
Total oranges = 56

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of people:

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Number of people
Oranges per person = 56 / 8
Oranges per person = 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges.

"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide that by the number of servings.

First, let's calculate the cost of the onions:
- Antoine doubles the amount of onions, so he uses 2 * 2 = 4 pounds.
- The cost of onions is $2.00 per pound, so 4 pounds will cost 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock:
- He needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box is $2.00, so the total cost for beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to get the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of onions + cost of beef stock = $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Finally, we divide the total cost by the number of servings to find the cost per serving:
- The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $2.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater and then determine how much earlier she needs to leave to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.

1. Wayne's drive time to the theater is 4 minutes.
2. Bernadette's drive time is four times Wayne's, so it is 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.
3. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to account for her longer drive time plus the 5-minute difference.

Wayne's total time to the theater is 4 minutes. Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before that, so she needs to leave 4 + 5 = 9 minutes before Wayne's arrival time.

However, since it takes her 16 minutes to drive, she needs to leave 16 minutes before her arrival time. To find out how much earlier she needs to leave compared to Wayne, we add the 9 minutes (to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne) to her 16-minute drive time:

16 (drive time) + 5 (time before Wayne's arrival) = 21 minutes.

Bernadette should leave 21 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room and the length, so we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

Area = Length × Width

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length to feet because the area is given in square feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so:

Length in feet = 3 yards × 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now we can solve for the width:

360 square feet = 9 feet × Width
Width = 360 square feet / 9 feet
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

Perimeter = 2 × (Length + Width)

Substituting the values we have:

Perimeter = 2 × (9 feet + 40 feet)
Perimeter = 2 × 49 feet
Perimeter = 98 feet

So, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

(1 + 2) * 20
3 * 20
60 beads

Margareth's total beads:
(3 packs of blue + 4 packs of red) * 20 beads/pack
(3 + 4) * 20
7 * 20

Now, we find the difference:
Margareth's beads - Elizabeth's beads
140 beads - 60 beads
80 beads

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

Then Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. The total cooling is:

30 minutes / 10 minutes * 2 degrees = 3 * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

So the final temperature after the window is opened is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon.
   - Swim: 40 minutes
   - Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
   - Run: 50 minutes
   - Total time for Jon: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

2. Next, we calculate the time it took James to complete the swim, which is 10% faster than Jon.
   - 10% of 40 minutes is 4 minutes (10/100 * 40 = 4)
   - James's swim time: 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

3. James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon.
   - James's bike time: 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

4. We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.
   - James's total time: 170 + 10 = 180 minutes

5. Now we can calculate the time it took James to complete the run by subtracting the swim and bike times from his total time.
   - James's run time: 180 - (36 + 85) = 180 - 121 = 59 minutes

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run.

Now, we can calculate the length of Movie B, which is 5 minutes longer than Movie C:

Movie B length = Movie C length + 5 minutes

Finally, we can find the length of Movie A, which is one-fourth the length of Movie B:

Movie A length = Movie B length / 4

Let's do the calculations:

Movie C length = 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes
Movie B length = 75 + 5 = 80 minutes
Movie A length = 80 / 4 = 20 minutes

So, Movie A is 20 minutes long.

"First, let's calculate how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

Since 30 minutes is half an hour, we can calculate the distance as follows:
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 32 MPH × 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Next, we need to determine how much hay the horse will eat for running 16 miles. The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, so:
Hay consumed = 16 miles × 1/2 bail of hay/mile
Hay consumed = 8 bails of hay

Now, let's calculate the cost of 8 bails of hay. Each bail costs $3, so:
Cost of hay = 8 bails × $3/bail
Cost of hay = $24

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which means he has:
Total money = 6 × $5
Total money = $30

Finally, we calculate the change Michael will have after buying the hay:
Change = Total money - Cost of hay
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

3. Number of sneakers sold to the department store:
   Total sneakers - Sneakers sold at flash sale = 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers

4. Revenue from the department store:
   Number of sneakers sold to the department store * Price per sneaker = 31 * $25 = $775

5. Total revenue:
   Revenue from flash sale + Revenue from department store = $340 + $775 = $1115

"Let's break down the problem:

- The cost of the movie super ticket is $20, which includes the movie, one popcorn, and a soda for $1 extra, making the total $21.
- The cost of a regular movie ticket is $12.
- The cost of a soda is $3.
- You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.

If you didn't buy the super ticket, you paid for the regular movie ticket, the popcorn, and the soda. The total cost of these items is the regular movie ticket price plus the regular price of the popcorn plus the cost of the soda. We know that this total cost is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket with the extra $1 for the popcorn and soda.

So, the equation to represent this is:

Regular movie ticket + Regular price of popcorn + Cost of soda = Cost of super ticket + $1 - $2

$12 + Regular price of popcorn + $3 = $21 - $2

Now, we can solve for the regular price of the popcorn:

$12 + Regular price of popcorn + $3 = $19
Regular price of popcorn = $19 - $12 - $3
Regular price of popcorn = $4

The regular price of the popcorn is $4."

Original cost per balloon = $45

After the price increase, the new cost per balloon is the original cost plus the increase.

New cost per balloon = Original cost per balloon + Price increase
New cost per balloon = $45 + $20
New cost per balloon = $65

Now, we can calculate how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price.

Total cost for 170 balloons = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
Total cost for 170 balloons = $65 * 170
Total cost for 170 balloons = $11,050

The final numerical answer is:
11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, we calculate the distance traveled at each speed:
- At 60 mph for 2 hours, the distance is 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles.
- At 30 mph for 1 hour, the distance is 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles.

The total distance traveled is 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles.

The total time taken is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

"To find out how much the potting soil will cost Bob, we need to calculate the total volume of soil required and then determine the cost based on the volume of soil each bag can hold and the price per bag.

First, we calculate the volume of one raised bed:
Volume of one raised bed = width * length * height
Volume of one raised bed = 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet
Volume of one raised bed = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
Total volume of soil = volume of one raised bed * number of beds
Total volume of soil = 32 cubic feet * 10
Total volume of soil = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:
Number of bags = total volume of soil / volume per bag
Number of bags = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet per bag
Number of bags = 160 bags

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
Total cost = number of bags * cost per bag
Total cost = 160 bags * $12 per bag
Total cost = $1920

The final numerical answer is:
1920"

"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then divide the total weight by the truck's capacity.

1. Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
2. Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
3. Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
4. Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:

Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)
Total weight = 4500 pounds

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, so we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find out how many trips are needed:

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip
Number of trips = 2

Since the number of trips is a whole number, the farmer will need exactly 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To find out how many cents Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the weekly earnings from both the aluminum cans and the plastic bottles, and then multiply by four.

First, we calculate the weekly earnings from the aluminum cans:
3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week from cans

Next, we calculate the weekly earnings from the plastic bottles:
5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week from bottles

Now, we add the weekly earnings from cans and bottles to get the total weekly earnings:
6 cents/week + 15 cents/week = 21 cents/week

Finally, we multiply the total weekly earnings by the number of weeks in the month to get the monthly earnings:
21 cents/week * 4 weeks/month = 84 cents/month

So, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month.

"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many plants Toni has.
2. Use the number of plants Toni has to find out how many plants Shondra has.

First, we know that Frederick has 10 plants. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. To find out how many plants Toni has, we calculate 60% of Frederick's plants and add that to the number of plants Frederick has:

60% of 10 plants = 0.60 * 10 = 6 plants

So, Toni has 10 plants + 6 plants = 16 plants.

Now, Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So we subtract 7 from the number of plants Toni has to find out how many plants Shondra has:

16 plants - 7 plants = 9 plants

Shondra has 9 plants.

"First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has:

6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 basketball cards

Next, we'll calculate the total number of baseball cards:

5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 baseball cards

Now, we'll add the basketball and baseball cards to find the total number of cards:

150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 cards

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so we subtract those from the total:

350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards

These 300 cards are the ones she gives to her students. If each student gets 10 cards, we can find the number of students by dividing the number of cards given away by the number of cards each student receives:

300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for both Becky and Kelly, taking into account the discounts they received, and then find the difference between the two amounts.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Becky:
- Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each.
- The total cost before the discount is 20 * 45 cents = 900 cents or $9.00.
- Becky received a $1 discount, so the final cost for Becky is $9.00 - $1.00 = $8.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for Kelly:
- Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each.
- The total cost before the discount is 20 * 50 cents = 1000 cents or $10.00.
- Kelly received a 10 percent discount, so the discount amount is 10% of $10.00, which is $1.00.
- The final cost for Kelly is $10.00 - $1.00 = $9.00.

Now, we find the difference between what Kelly paid and what Becky paid:
- Kelly paid $9.00 and Becky paid $8.00.
- The difference is $9.00 - $8.00 = $1.00.

So, Kelly paid $1.00 more than Becky.

"To find out how many carrot sticks Matt has to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( c \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we can set the equation equal to 5:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Now, to isolate \( c \), we multiply both sides by 2:

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the shark's length to inches because the remoras' length is given in inches.
2. Calculate the combined length of the two remoras.
3. Divide the combined length of the remoras by the shark's length in inches.
4. Multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage.

Let's do the calculations:

1. The shark is 10 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the shark's length in inches is:
   10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches

2. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length is:
   2 remoras * 6 inches/remora = 12 inches

3. The combined length of the remoras as a fraction of the shark's length is:
   12 inches / 120 inches = 0.1

4. To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
   0.1 * 100 = 10%

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs contain 8 razors. The cost per razor is the total cost divided by the number of razors:

$2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.25 to cents:

$0.25 = 25 cents

So, the cost per individual razor after the discount is 25 cents.

"To calculate the height of the human pyramid, we need to add up the heights of the cheerleaders, starting with the shortest at the top and then the others in the order they are stacked.

The 10th cheerleader, who is the shortest at 60 inches, will be at the top.
The next level will have 2 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall.
The next level will have 3 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall.
The bottom level will have 4 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall.

Let's calculate the total height in inches and then convert it to feet.

Total height in inches = (1 * 60) + (2 * 64) + (3 * 64) + (4 * 64)
Total height in inches = 60 + 128 + 192 + 256
Total height in inches = 636

Now, to convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot).

Total height in feet = 636 / 12
Total height in feet = 53

"Let's denote Angela's current age as \( A \).

According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Brett is currently 14 years old, so in four years, Angela's age will be \( A + 4 \), and this is equal to three times Brett's current age, which is \( 3 \times 14 \).

So we can write the equation:

\[ A + 4 = 3 \times 14 \]

Now we solve for \( A \):

\[ A + 4 = 42 \]
\[ A = 42 - 4 \]
\[ A = 38 \]

Angela is currently 38 years old.

"To calculate the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we need to consider the cost of each ride and the number of rides he took.

Each morning ride costs $6, and he drives in the morning twice a day for 14 days, so the total cost for the morning rides is:
$6 * 2 rides/day * 14 days = $168

Each afternoon ride costs $2, and he drives in the afternoon twice a day for 14 days, so the total cost for the afternoon rides is:
$2 * 2 rides/day * 14 days = $56

Now, we add the cost of the morning rides and the afternoon rides to get the total cost:
$168 + $56 = $224

Therefore, Paul spent $224 on driving his car during these two weeks.

"Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each, so she brought a total of:

5 boxes * 10 oranges/box = 50 oranges

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she brought:

50 oranges + 20 oranges = 70 oranges

Together, they have:

50 oranges + 70 oranges = 120 oranges

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, the number of pies they can make is:

120 oranges / 3 oranges/pie = 40 pies

"To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation where the total cost of each venue is the same.

Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 per person for food. So the total cost for the first venue is:
\[ 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per person, which includes food. So the total cost for the second venue is:
\[ 25x \]

We want to find the value of \( x \) where these two costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"Let's denote the number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi as L, D, and B, respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Together they collected 43 insects:
   L + D + B = 43

2. Lily found 7 more than David:
   L = D + 7

3. David found half of what Bodhi found:
   D = B / 2

We can substitute the second and third equations into the first to solve for the variables.

First, let's express B in terms of D using the third equation:
   B = 2D

Now, substitute L and B in the first equation with their expressions in terms of D:
   (D + 7) + D + (2D) = 43

Combine like terms:
   4D + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
   4D = 36

Divide by 4:
   D = 9

Now that we have D, we can find L:
   L = D + 7
   L = 9 + 7
   L = 16

Lily found 16 insects.

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of the skein they each used and then multiply by the total number of yards in a skein.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 4 in this case.

1/4 (Mariah's portion) + 2/4 (Grandma's portion, since 1/2 is equivalent to 2/4) = 3/4 (total portion used)

Now, we multiply the total portion used by the number of yards in a skein:

3/4 * 364 yards = 273 yards

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.
- 2 packs are strawberry.
- 1 pack is grape, which costs $2.
- 1 pack is green apple, which costs half as much as the grape pack, so it costs $2 / 2 = $1.
- The total cost of all the gum is $7.

We can set up an equation to find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum. Let's call the cost of each pack of strawberry gum ""S"".

The total cost can be represented as:
2S (for the strawberry packs) + $2 (for the grape pack) + $1 (for the green apple pack) = $7

Now we can solve for S:
2S + $2 + $1 = $7
2S + $3 = $7
2S = $7 - $3
2S = $4
S = $4 / 2
S = $2

Each pack of strawberry gum cost $2."
"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the number of sticks he can get from each type of wood and then figure out the best combination within his budget.

First, let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

- A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks.
  Cost per stick from 2 x 4 = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

- A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks.
  Cost per stick from 2 x 8 = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood provides a lower cost per stick, it is the cheaper option. However, the question asks for the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber, which in this case is the 2 x 4 piece of wood.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces of wood he can buy with $24:

- Number of 2 x 4 pieces he can buy = $24 / $4 per piece = 6 pieces

Since each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make is:

- Total sticks from 2 x 4 = 6 pieces * 200 sticks per piece = 1200 sticks

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber (2 x 4) is:

"To calculate the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of legs for all dogs.
2. Calculate the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair.

Step 1: Total number of legs
Each dog has 4 legs, and Mario has 6 dogs.
Total legs = 4 legs/dog * 6 dogs = 24 legs

Step 2: Number of pairs of snowshoes
Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the number of pairs.
Number of pairs = 24 legs / 2 legs/pair = 12 pairs

Step 3: Total cost
Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
Total cost = 12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00

Therefore, it will cost Mario $144.00 to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs.

"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the bus trips without the pass:
- Janet takes 2 bus trips per day.
- Each bus trip costs $2.20.
- She takes these trips 5 days a week.

Total cost per week without the pass = 2 trips/day * $2.20/trip * 5 days/week

Now, let's calculate the savings:
- The cost of the weekly bus pass is $20.
- We subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost without the pass to find the savings.

Let's do the math:

Total cost without the pass = 2 * $2.20 * 5 = $22.00
Savings = Total cost without the pass - Cost of the weekly pass
Savings = $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass.

"To calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to reach his goal, we first need to determine the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th, and then calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.

1. Calculate the total number of days:
- From January 1st to July 19th (since today is December 31st, we start counting from the next day, January 1st):
- January has 31 days, but we start from the 1st, so 31 days.
- February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year).
- March has 31 days.
- April has 30 days.
- May has 31 days.
- June has 30 days.
- July has 19 days (up to the 19th).

Adding these up: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days.

2. Calculate the total number of calories to lose 30 lbs:
- 1 lb = 3500 calories
- 30 lbs = 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories

3. Calculate the daily calorie deficit:
- Total calories to lose / Number of days = 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories per day

So, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to reach his goal by July 19th.

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write that as:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write that as:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second one:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Now we can solve for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by multiplying the cost of the lot by 3:
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So the house cost $90,000.

"Let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C_O \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has, and \( S_O \) be the number of sofas Ophelia has. According to the problem, Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so we can write:

\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]

We are also given that Ophelia has 20 sofas, so:

\[ S_O = 20 \]

Substituting the value of \( S_O \) into the first equation, we get:

\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]

Solving for \( C_O \), we find:

\[ C_O = 20 + 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Now, let's consider Jenna. Let \( C_J \) be the number of chairs Jenna has, and \( S_J \) be the number of sofas Jenna has. We know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so:

\[ C_J = 3 \times C_O \]
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]

Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so:

\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]

Now we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together:

Total sofas = \( S_O + S_J \)
Total sofas = \( 20 + 64 \)
Total sofas = \( 84 \)

Total chairs = \( C_O + C_J \)
Total chairs = \( 22 + 66 \)
Total chairs = \( 88 \)

Total number of sofas and chairs = Total sofas + Total chairs
Total number of sofas and chairs = \( 84 + 88 \)
Total number of sofas and chairs = \( 172 \)

3. 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus, so 5 * 8 = 40 passengers get on.
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is 40 (remaining) + 40 (new) = 80.
5. On the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so 80 - 21 = 59 passengers remain.
6. 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 1/3 of the number who got off, so 21 / 3 = 7 passengers get on.
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is 59 (remaining) + 7 (new) = 66.

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is 66."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so currently Jame is:
   27 - 5 = 22 years old.

2. In 8 years, Jame will be:
   22 + 8 = 30 years old.

3. In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time, so:
   2 * 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 years old.

4. This means that currently, his cousin is:
   55 - 8 = 47 years old.

5. The age difference between Jame and his cousin now is:
   47 - 22 = 25 years.

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is 25.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we can start by determining the cost of the printer. Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost:

$1,100 - $400 = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, the printer, and the two monitors is $2,400. We can set up the following equation to find the cost of the two monitors:

Cost of computer + Cost of printer + 2 * Cost of one monitor = Total cost
$1,100 + $700 + 2 * Cost of one monitor = $2,400

Now, we can solve for the cost of one monitor:

2 * Cost of one monitor = $2,400 - ($1,100 + $700)
2 * Cost of one monitor = $2,400 - $1,800
2 * Cost of one monitor = $600

Divide both sides by 2 to find the cost of one monitor:

Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

So, the cost of one monitor is $300.

"Let's break down the problem:

- There are 20 kids in total, divided into two equal groups of girls and boys.
- This means there are 10 boys and 10 girls.
- Each boy brought back 60 shells.
- Each girl brought back the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

The number of shells each girl brought back can be calculated as follows:

Shells brought by each girl = Shells brought by each boy + 4 * (Shells brought by each boy)
Shells brought by each girl = 60 + 4 * 60
Shells brought by each girl = 60 + 240
Shells brought by each girl = 300

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to add the thickness of each book together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 mm = 62 mm thick.

Now, we add the thickness of all four books:

31 mm (first book) + 50 mm (second book) + 45 mm (third book) + 62 mm (fourth book) = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

"To calculate the total amount you need to pay, you first need to calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill and then add that to the original bill. After that, since the bill is being split evenly, you would pay half of the original bill plus the entire tip (as you are the one paying the tip).

Here's the calculation:

1. Calculate the 20% tip:
   20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

2. Add the tip to the original bill to get the total:
   $50 + $10 = $60

3. Since the bill is split evenly, you pay half of the original bill:
   $50 / 2 = $25

4. Add the tip to your half of the bill:
   $25 + $10 = $35

So, you end up paying $35.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125.

April has 30 days, so the first half of the month consists of 15 days, and the second half also consists of 15 days.

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of the month as \( x \). According to the problem, he saves twice as much each day in the second half, which would be \( 2x \).

The total savings for the month can be expressed as:
\[ 15x + 15(2x) = 1125 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Since \( x \) is the amount saved each day in the first half, the amount saved each day in the second half is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

So, Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of April.

5 oranges * $0.80/orange = $4.00

The cost of the peaches is:
6 peaches * $0.75/peach = $4.50

The total cost of the fruits is:

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find out how much Brad gets, we divide both sides by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} \]
\[ B = 20 \]

Now that we know Brad gets 20 dollars, we can find out how much Jeff gets by multiplying Brad's amount by 4:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of letters Elise has written.

1. First, Elise writes the full alphabet twice. The English alphabet has 26 letters, so writing it twice would be:
   26 letters * 2 = 52 letters

2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of the alphabet is:
   26 letters / 2 = 13 letters

3. After that, she re-writes everything she has already written. At this point, she has written 52 letters (from the first step) plus 13 letters (from the second step), which totals:
   52 letters + 13 letters = 65 letters

4. Rewriting everything she has already written means she writes another 65 letters.

5. The total number of letters Elise has written is the sum of the letters from the first two steps and the letters from the third step:

2. Cost of pens: 2 pens * $0.25/pen = $0.50
3. Cost of calculator: 1 calculator * $12.00/calculator = $12.00
4. Cost of geometry set: 1 geometry set * $10.00/geometry set = $10.00

Now, we add up the costs to get the total before the discount:
Total before discount = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total:
Discount = 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Ray takes to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water, and then find the difference between the two times.

First, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim 1 mile in warm water:
- In cold water, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
- In warm water, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water.

So, the time to swim 1 mile in warm water is:
2 * 16 minutes (twice as long) + 2 minutes (2 minutes more) = 32 minutes + 2 minutes = 34 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time to swim 3 miles:
- In cold water, 3 miles would take 3 * 16 minutes = 48 minutes.
- In warm water, 3 miles would take 3 * 34 minutes = 102 minutes.

Finally, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water:

"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how many he buys each day and then sum them up.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spends an equal amount each day on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. Since there are 4 days, we can calculate the daily spending as follows:

Total money: $70
Number of days for wooden action figures: 4
Total money spent on wooden action figures: 4 days * $5/action figure

Let's calculate the number of wooden action figures he can buy:
Number of wooden action figures = Total money spent on wooden action figures / Cost per wooden action figure

For the remaining days of the week (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. There are 3 days left, and we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying the wooden action figures to determine how many plastic action figures he can buy.

Let's do the calculations:

Total money spent on wooden action figures = 4 days * $5/action figure = $20
Money left for plastic action figures = Total money - Total money spent on wooden action figures = $70 - $20 = $50

Number of wooden action figures = $20 / $5/action figure = 4 action figures

Now, we calculate the number of plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining money:
Number of plastic action figures = Money left for plastic action figures / Cost per plastic action figure = $50 / $2/action figure = 25 action figures

Finally, we add the number of wooden and plastic action figures to get the total:
Total action figures = Number of wooden action figures + Number of plastic action figures = 4 + 25 = 29

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses required by the flower shops and compare it to the number of roses Ford can grow.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses required by the flower shops per week:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

Total roses required per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses required per month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks:
Total roses required per month = 65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Next, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford can grow per month:
Ford grows 40 roses every week, so in a month (4 weeks), he can grow:
Total roses grown per month = 40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

Now, we can find out how many roses Ford lacks by subtracting the number of roses he can grow from the number of roses required:
Roses Ford lacks per month = Total roses required per month - Total roses grown per month
Roses Ford lacks per month = 260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month

"To find out how much money Katina will have in her savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she will withdraw over that period and then subtract it from her initial balance.

Katina withdraws $100 every month. There are 12 months in a year, so over 2 years, she will make 2 * 12 = 24 withdrawals.

The total amount withdrawn over 2 years is 24 * $100 = $2400.

Katina's initial balance is $3000. After withdrawing $2400 over 2 years, the remaining balance will be:

$3000 - $2400 = $600

"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total cost and the total revenue, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 (since 1 loaf makes 10 sandwiches).
The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00.
So, the total cost for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00.

The revenue from selling 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each is 10 * $7.00 = $70.00.

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
$70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of small crayon pieces Kate has.
2. Determine how many crayon muffins she can make with those pieces.
3. Calculate the total amount of money she can make by selling the crayon muffins.

Step 1: Total number of small crayon pieces
Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, so the total number of crayon pieces is:
3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayon pieces

Step 2: Number of crayon muffins
Since it takes 8 small pieces to make one crayon muffin, the number of crayon muffins she can make is:
192 crayon pieces / 8 pieces/muffin = 24 crayon muffins

Step 3: Total money made
If she sells each crayon muffin for $1.50, the total amount of money she can make is:
24 crayon muffins * $1.50/muffin = $36.00

So, the final amount of money Kate can make is:
$36.00"
"To calculate the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet, we need to consider the cost of the new carpet, the padding, the removal of the old carpet, and the installation of the new carpet. We will calculate each cost per square foot and then multiply by the total area of the bedroom.

1. Calculate the area of the bedroom:
   Area = length × width
   Area = 18 feet × 12 feet
   Area = 216 square feet

2. Calculate the cost of the new carpet:
   Cost of carpet = area × cost per square foot
   Cost of carpet = 216 square feet × $12/square foot
   Cost of carpet = $2,592

3. Calculate the cost of the padding:
   Cost of padding = area × cost per square foot
   Cost of padding = 216 square feet × $2/square foot
   Cost of padding = $432

4. Calculate the cost to remove the old carpet:
   Cost to remove = area × cost per square foot
   Cost to remove = 216 square feet × $4/square foot
   Cost to remove = $864

5. Calculate the cost to install the new carpet:
   Cost to install = area × cost per square foot
   Cost to install = 216 square feet × $34/square foot
   Cost to install = $7,344

6. Calculate the total cost:
   Total cost = cost of carpet + cost of padding + cost to remove + cost to install
   Total cost = $2,592 + $432 + $864 + $7,344
   Total cost = $11,232

The total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is $11,232.

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day over the week, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw and then divide by the number of days.

Here's the breakdown:
- Days one and two: 50 birds
- Day three: 0 birds
- Days four and five: 120 birds
- Day six: 20 birds
- Day seven: 90 birds

First, we add up the total number of birds:
50 (days one and two) + 0 (day three) + 120 (days four and five) + 20 (day six) + 90 (day seven) = 280 birds

Now, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days (7) to find the average:
280 birds / 7 days = 40 birds per day

The average number of birds Mack saw in a day is 40.

"To solve the problem, we need to follow the steps as described:

1. Start with the initial value, which is 20.
2. Add half of the initial value to itself.
3. Divide the result by 5.
4. Subtract 12 from the initial value.
5. Multiply the result from step 3 by the result from step 4.

Let's calculate it step by step:

1. Initial value: 20
2. Half of the initial value: 20 / 2 = 10
3. Initial value plus half the initial value: 20 + 10 = 30
4. Divide the result by 5: 30 / 5 = 6
5. Initial value minus 12: 20 - 12 = 8

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then apply that percentage to the desired temperature of 520 degrees.

First, let's find the percentage increase from the set temperature to the actual temperature when the oven is set to 450 degrees.

The actual temperature is 468 degrees, and the set temperature is 450 degrees. The difference is:

468 - 450 = 18 degrees

The percentage increase is:

(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Now, we need to find the temperature to set the oven to so that it will actually reach 520 degrees, given that it will be 4% higher than the set temperature.

Let x be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be x plus 4% of x:

x + 0.04x = 520

1.04x = 520

Now, we solve for x:

x = 520 / 1.04
x = 500

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the first movie is:
1 hour * 60 minutes/hour + 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. So, the second movie is:
2 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the duration of both movies together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and then subtract that from Herb's house value.

30% of $76,000 is:
0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800

So, Juan's house is worth:
$76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, to find the combined value of the two houses, we add the value of Herb's house and Juan's house together:
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The combined value of the two houses is $129,200.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.
2. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.
3. Judy's friend brought 40 cups to the event.
4. Judy's friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so the friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend:

- Judy's utensils: 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36 utensils
- Friend's utensils: 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84 utensils

Adding both together, we get the total number of utensils:

36 + 84 = 120

"To find the cost per pair of contacts when Pete buys 2 boxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost for 2 boxes with the 10% discount.
2. Determine the total number of contacts Pete gets from 2 boxes.
3. Divide the total cost by the total number of contacts to find the cost per contact.

Let's do the math:

1. The cost of 1 box is $100.00, and with a 10% discount, the cost of 1 box is:
   $100.00 - ($100.00 * 0.10) = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

2. The cost for 2 boxes is:
   $90.00 * 2 = $180.00

3. The total number of contacts from 2 boxes is:
   90 contacts/box * 2 boxes = 180 contacts

4. The cost per contact is:
   $180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00/contact

Since the question asks for the cost per pair of contacts, and a pair consists of 2 contacts, we need to divide the cost per contact by 2:

$1.00/contact / 2 = $0.50/pair

The final numerical answer is:
0.50"
"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate the total earnings for both of them and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked by Jill:
- Saturday: 2 hours
- Sunday: 1 hour
Total hours worked by Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the total hours worked by John:
- Saturday: 2 times Jill's hours on Saturday = 2 * 2 = 4 hours
- Sunday: 3 times Jill's hours on Sunday = 3 * 1 = 3 hours
Total hours worked by John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Next, we calculate the earnings for both:
- Jill's earnings: 3 hours * $10/hour = $30
- John's earnings: 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

Finally, we find the difference in their earnings:
John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

So, John earned $40 more than Jill.

"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total number of calories she burns during her exercise.

Hannah burns 500 calories per hour doing aerobics. Since she does aerobics for 2 hours, the total calories burned from aerobics is:
500 calories/hour * 2 hours = 1000 calories

Next, she burns 600 calories per hour running. Since she runs for 1 hour, the total calories burned from running is:
600 calories/hour * 1 hour = 600 calories

Now, we add the calories burned from both activities to get the total calories burned:
1000 calories (aerobics) + 600 calories (running) = 1600 calories

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned. To find out how much water she needs to drink, we divide the total calories burned by 200 and then multiply by 100 ml:
(1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml = 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water.

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans \( G \) is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. We can express these relationships as:

\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is 4500:

\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} \]
\[ B = 1500 \]

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

\[ R = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is:

\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

Now, we add the three measurements together:
47 WPM + 52 WPM + 57 WPM = 156 WPM

To find the average, we divide the total sum by the number of measurements, which is 3:
156 WPM / 3 = 52 WPM

The average of the three measurements is 52 WPM.

"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to calculate the height of the beanstalk each day until it exceeds 20 feet.

The beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles in height every day. We can represent the height of the beanstalk on day n as:

Height on day n = Initial height * 2^(n-1)

Where n is the number of days since planting. We want to find the smallest n such that the height is greater than 20 feet.

Let's calculate:

Day 1: 4 * 2^(1-1) = 4 * 2^0 = 4 * 1 = 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2^(2-1) = 4 * 2^1 = 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 4 * 2^(3-1) = 4 * 2^2 = 4 * 4 = 16 feet
Day 4: 4 * 2^(4-1) = 4 * 2^3 = 4 * 8 = 32 feet

On day 4, the beanstalk is 32 feet tall, which is the first time it exceeds the 20 feet height of Mark's window.

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, the second angle is twice the smallest angle, which is \( 2x \) degrees, and the third angle is three times the smallest angle, which is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} \]
\[ x = 30 \]

The largest angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is:

10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations per month = 72 months

Finally, we convert months into years:
72 months / 12 months per year = 6 years

So, the tire will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To find out how much each pump of shampoo costs in cents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of washes Jackie can get if she uses 1 pump per wash.
2. Calculate the cost per wash.
3. Convert the cost per wash to cents.

Step 1: Since the bottle gives 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash, if Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, she will get twice as many washes from the bottle.
Total washes with 1 pump per wash = 120 washes * 2 = 240 washes

Step 2: The cost of the bottle is $24.00, so we divide this by the total number of washes to find the cost per wash.
Cost per wash = $24.00 / 240 washes = $0.10 per wash

Step 3: Since we need the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents).
Cost per wash in cents = $0.10 * 100 cents/dollar = 10 cents

Therefore, each pump of shampoo will cost Jackie 10 cents.

"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to calculate the cost for each street and then find the difference.

First, we calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
Cost for Monica's street = 150 meters * $194/meter

Next, we calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
Cost for Lewis' street = 490 meters * $194/meter

Finally, we find the difference in cost:
Difference in cost = Cost for Lewis' street - Cost for Monica's street

Let's do the math:

Cost for Monica's street = 150 * 194 = $29,100
Cost for Lewis' street = 490 * 194 = $95,060

Difference in cost = $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the additional months.

For the first 5 months, the cost is straightforward:
5 months * $100,000 / 5 months = $100,000

The research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so the total duration of the research is:
5 months * 10 = 50 months

The additional months of research are:
50 months - 5 months = 45 months

The cost per month for the additional 45 months is 50% more than the initial monthly cost. The initial monthly cost is $100,000 / 5 months = $20,000 per month. Therefore, the increased monthly cost is:
$20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month

The cost for the additional 45 months is:
45 months * $30,000 per month = $1,350,000

Now, we add the cost of the initial 5 months to the cost of the additional 45 months to get the total cost:
$100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000

The total cost of John's research is:
$1,450,000"
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the ounces of meat eaten by each player who ordered meat.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, that's 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these up:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

So, the team consumed a total of 30 ounces of meat.

"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of loads Gary does in a week.
2. Calculate the number of loads Gary does in a year.
3. Calculate the total amount of water used in a year.
4. Calculate the total cost of the water used in a year.

Step 1: Number of loads per week
Gary does laundry twice a week, so he does 2 loads per week.

Step 2: Number of loads per year
There are 52 weeks in a year, so the number of loads per year is:
2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads/year

Step 3: Total amount of water used per year
Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used per year is:
104 loads/year * 20 gallons/load = 2080 gallons/year

Step 4: Total cost of water used per year
A gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost of water used per year is:
2080 gallons/year * $0.15/gallon = $312/year

Therefore, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year.

"Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so that's an additional 1 + 1 = 2 pieces of gum.

In total, Jim chews 4 (at school) + 2 (on the way home and after dinner) = 6 pieces of gum during the day.

Starting with a 20 pack of gum, after chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Jim then gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

Therefore, at the end of the day, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb per second to kb per hour.
2. Convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour.

Step 1: Convert kb per second to kb per hour.
There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.
Ashley's speed is 20 kb per second, so in one hour, she can download:
20 kb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72000 kb/hour

Step 2: Convert kb per hour to Mb per hour.
Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we divide the total kb per hour by 1000 to get Mb per hour.
72000 kb/hour / 1000 kb/Mb = 72 Mb/hour

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height and Adam's current height, and then divide that by the rate at which he grows each year.

The required height to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the required height in inches is:
4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Adam's current height is 40 inches. The difference between the required height and Adam's current height is:
48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches

Adam grows 2 inches a year, so the number of years it will take for him to grow the additional 8 inches is:
8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

So, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the total sales, the cost to the company, the profit, and then James's commission on the profit.

1. Calculate the total sales:
   James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
   Total sales = 10 * $25,000 = $250,000

2. Calculate the cost to the company:
   The company paid 30% of the car's price to acquire each car.
   Cost to the company per car = 30% of $25,000 = 0.30 * $25,000 = $7,500
   Total cost to the company for 10 cars = 10 * $7,500 = $75,000

3. Calculate the profit:
   Profit = Total sales - Total cost to the company
   Profit = $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

4. Calculate James's commission:
   James gets a 10% commission on the profits.
   James's commission = 10% of $175,000 = 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The price of a diamond jewel is given as $2000.
2. The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. So, the price of a gold jewel is:
   \( \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times \text{Price of diamond jewel} \)
   \( \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 \)
   \( \text{Price of gold jewel} = 1600 \)

3. The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. So, the price of a silver jewel is:
   \( \text{Price of silver jewel} = \text{Price of gold jewel} - 400 \)
   \( \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 \)
   \( \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1200 \)

4. The total price for all three jewels is the sum of the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:
   \( \text{Total price} = \text{Price of diamond jewel} + \text{Price of gold jewel} + \text{Price of silver jewel} \)
   \( \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 \)

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between them. Since Tom is driving faster than Bob, we can find the difference in their speeds and then use that to find out how long it will take for Tom to make up the distance.

The difference in their speeds is:
70 mph (Tom's speed) - 55 mph (Bob's speed) = 15 mph

This means Tom is gaining 15 miles on Bob every hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up, we divide the distance by the rate at which Tom is gaining on Bob:

75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if he misses some. The total cost of the classes is $60, and there are 10 classes in total.

If Manny misses a class, the cost per class for the attended classes will increase. We need to find the point at which the cost per class exceeds $10.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). The number of classes he attends will then be \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class when he misses \( x \) classes is \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the maximum \( x \) such that \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \).

Solving the inequality:

\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]

\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

\[ 10x \leq 40 \]

\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes and the cost per class will still be $10 or less. If he misses 5 or more classes, the cost per class will exceed $10, and his parents won't sign him up again.

"To find the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to determine how many customers Julie can process daily, and then we can calculate the total for both of them for the week.

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers daily, Julie processes:

50 customers/day * 2 = 100 customers/day

Now, we can calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day:

50 customers/day (Jewel) + 100 customers/day (Julie) = 150 customers/day

Since they work all days of the week, we multiply the daily total by 7 to get the weekly total:

"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to calculate the volume of the hole and then multiply that by the time it takes him to shovel a cubic foot of earth.

The volume of the hole is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and depth:

Volume = Length × Width × Depth
Volume = 6 feet × 4 feet × 3 feet
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Now, if it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, the total time to dig the hole is:

Total time = Volume × Time per cubic foot
Total time = 72 cubic feet × 3 seconds/cubic foot
Total time = 216 seconds

To convert the time into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

Total time in minutes = 216 seconds ÷ 60 seconds/minute
Total time in minutes = 3.6 minutes

However, since the question asks for the final numerical answer in seconds, we will provide the answer in seconds:

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500
6. Towing package: The cost of the towing package is not provided, so we will assume it is included in the ""several added features"" and needs to be accounted for. However, since the cost is not specified, we cannot add a numerical value for it. If we assume the towing package is free or the cost is included in the other features, we can proceed without it. If it has a cost, we would need that information to provide an accurate total.

Since the cost of the towing package is not provided, I will calculate the total cost without it and note that the actual total may be higher if the towing package has a cost.

Total cost = Base price + King cab + Leather seats + Running boards + Upgraded exterior light package
Total cost = $30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500

"To calculate Tim's new annual salary after the promotion, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new monthly salary after the 5% raise.
2. Calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary based on the new salary.
3. Calculate the total annual salary, which is the sum of the 12 months of the new salary and the bonus.

Step 1: New monthly salary after 5% raise
New monthly salary = Original monthly salary + (5% of original monthly salary)
New monthly salary = $20,000 + (0.05 * $20,000)
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000

Step 2: Calculate the bonus
Bonus = 0.5 * New monthly salary
Bonus = 0.5 * $21,000
Bonus = $10,500

Step 3: Calculate the total annual salary
Total annual salary = (New monthly salary * 12) + Bonus
Total annual salary = ($21,000 * 12) + $10,500
Total annual salary = $252,000 + $10,500
Total annual salary = $262,500

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. Steve's wife is 4 years older than him, so she is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.
3. Their son is currently half as old as his mom, so the son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.
4. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so she is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

Therefore, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.

"To find out how much flour was in three bags in total before it was divided into portions, we first need to determine how much flour was in one bag. Since one bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can calculate the total amount of flour in one bag as follows:

1 portion = 2 kilograms
8 portions = 8 * 2 kilograms

Now, we multiply the total amount of flour in one bag by 3 to find out how much flour was in three bags:

Total flour in 3 bags = 3 * (8 * 2) kilograms

Let's do the calculation:

Total flour in 3 bags = 3 * 16 kilograms
Total flour in 3 bags = 48 kilograms

"To find out how many miles Alisa and Stanley biked in total, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add those distances together.

The formula to calculate distance is:
Distance = Speed × Time

For Alisa:
Distance (Alisa) = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours

For Stanley:
Distance (Stanley) = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours

Now we calculate each distance:

Distance (Alisa) = 12 × 4.5 = 54 miles
Distance (Stanley) = 10 × 2.5 = 25 miles

Now we add the distances together to get the total distance:

Total Distance = Distance (Alisa) + Distance (Stanley)
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

"To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for Clara and Sheila, taking into account the discounts and vouchers.

First, let's calculate the cost for Clara:
- Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each.
- The total cost before the voucher is 20 pomegranates * $20/pomegranate = $400.
- She got a $2 off voucher, so the final cost for Clara is $400 - $2 = $398.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Sheila:
- Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at the new price of $30 each.
- The total cost before the discount is 20 pomegranates * $30/pomegranate = $600.
- The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is 10% of $600 = 0.10 * $600 = $60.
- The final cost for Sheila after the discount is $600 - $60 = $540.

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid:
- The difference is $540 (Sheila's cost) - $398 (Clara's cost) = $142.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $142.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Ariadne's sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
2. The sales from green hats were twice the sales from red hats, so the sales from green hats were $400 * 2 = $800.
3. The total sales for the first month are the sum of the sales from red and green hats, which is $400 + $800 = $1200.
4. In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month, so the sales for the second month were $1200 * 3/4 = $900.
5. The total amount she made in two months is the sum of the sales from the first and second months, which is $1200 + $900 = $2100.

"To calculate the total cost James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of hours the carriage was hired.
2. Subtract the free hour to find the number of paid hours.
3. Calculate the cost for each paid hour.
4. Sum up the costs to get the total amount paid.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. Since he gets 1 hour free, he only pays for 3 hours.

The cost for the first paid hour is $15. Each subsequent hour is twice the cost of the previous hour.

- First paid hour: $15
- Second paid hour: $15 * 2 = $30
- Third paid hour: $30 * 2 = $60

Now, we add up the costs for the paid hours:

$15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $60 (third hour) = $105

So, the total amount James paid is:

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed for the guests.
2. Determine the number of whole eggs required based on the number of deviled egg halves.
3. Convert the number of whole eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Total number of deviled egg halves needed
Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests.
Total deviled egg halves = 3 halves/guest * 16 guests = 48 halves

Step 2: Number of whole eggs required
Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we can find the number of whole eggs needed by dividing the total number of deviled egg halves by 2.
Number of whole eggs = 48 halves / 2 halves/egg = 24 eggs

Step 3: Convert whole eggs to dozens
There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the number of whole eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.
Number of dozens = 24 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 2 dozens

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

"To calculate the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel expenses.

1. Initial cost of the plane: $150,000
2. Monthly hanger rental: $5,000
3. Monthly fuel expenses: $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Now, we calculate the total monthly maintenance cost (hanger rental + fuel expenses) and then multiply by 12 to get the annual maintenance cost.

Monthly maintenance cost: $5,000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000
Annual maintenance cost: $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost to get the total cost for the first year.

Total cost for the first year: $150,000 (initial cost) + $180,000 (annual maintenance) = $330,000

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Time to cook rice (R) = 30 minutes
2. Time to cook pork (P) = Time to cook rice (R) + 20 minutes = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes
3. Time to cook beans (B) = 1/2 * (Time to cook pork (P) + Time to cook rice (R)) = 1/2 * (50 minutes + 30 minutes) = 1/2 * 80 minutes = 40 minutes

Now, to find the total time to cook all the food, we add the time for each item:

Total cooking time = Time to cook rice (R) + Time to cook pork (P) + Time to cook beans (B)
Total cooking time = 30 minutes + 50 minutes + 40 minutes
Total cooking time = 120 minutes

So, it took Finley 120 minutes to cook all the food.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. We know that the total number of legs is 70, so we can write the first equation as:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We also know that the total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20, so we can write the second equation as:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

Now we can solve this system of equations. We can start by solving the second equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, we substitute \( G \) in the first equation with \( 20 - S \):
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, so for a week's worth, he needs 7 pounds of coffee. The more expensive brand of coffee costs 20% more than the normal brand, which is $5 per pound.

To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we calculate 20% of $5 and add it to the original price:
20% of $5 = 0.20 * $5 = $1

So the more expensive brand costs:
$5 + $1 = $6 per pound

For 7 pounds, the cost would be:
7 * $6 = $42

Adding the cost of the donut:
$42 + $2 = $44

Therefore, the total cost for everything is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much money Kassidy has. We know that Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120.
   Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
   Kassidy's money = 3/4 * $120
   Kassidy's money = $90

2. Next, we need to find out how much money Rayna has. We know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy.
   Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + $60
   Rayna's money = $90 + $60
   Rayna's money = $150

3. Now we can calculate the total amount of money they have together.
   Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
   Total money = $120 + $90 + $150
   Total money = $360

4. Finally, we need to find out how much each person would have if they shared the total amount equally.
   Money per person = Total money / 3

Since a month typically has 30 or 31 days, and we are considering a 30-day period, we have already accounted for 30 + 3 = 33 days, which is more than a month. However, since the question asks how many good days were left in the month, we need to consider only the 30-day period.

The 30-day period already included 12 good days, and the question specifies the next three days, which means we are looking at a 33-day period. Since we are only interested in the 30-day period, the number of good days left in the month after the 30 days is 0, because the month has ended.

However, if the question is asking how many good days there were in total during the 30-day period, the answer would be 12, as the next three days are not part of the 30-day period.

"James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs. There are 8 more dogs, so he needs to buy 8 toys to have enough for all 12 dogs. After buying the toys, he finds out there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there are now 24 dogs (12 dogs * 2). He then needs to buy 12 more toys to have enough for all 24 dogs. When he comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs toys for those 3 dogs. Therefore, he now needs toys for 21 dogs (24 dogs - 3 dogs).

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the terms with \( L \):

\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} \]

\[ L = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes Chris to mow half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode, and then add the two times together.

First, let's find out how long it takes to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode. Since it takes 1 hour (60 minutes) to mow the entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode, it will take half that time to mow half the lawn:

60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode. Since it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn in ""rabbit"" mode, it will take half that time to mow half the lawn:

40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes

Now, we add the two times together to get the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn:

30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

So, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write:

\[ T = R + 7 \]

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can write the equation for their combined ages as:

\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Now we can substitute \( T \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 44 - 14 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now that we have the age of one triplet, we can find the age of one twin:

\[ T = R + 7 \]
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"To find out how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost Manolo, we first need to determine the cost of one candy.

We know that:
- Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20.
- Each lollipop costs $0.40.

First, we calculate the total cost of the lollipops:
5 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $2.00

Now we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the four candies:
$3.20 total cost - $2.00 cost of lollipops = $1.20 cost of four candies

Next, we find the cost of one candy:
$1.20 cost of four candies / 4 candies = $0.30 per candy

Now we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
10 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $4.00
10 candies * $0.30 per candy = $3.00

Finally, we add the cost of the 10 lollipops and 10 candies together:
$4.00 cost of 10 lollipops + $3.00 cost of 10 candies = $7.00

The final cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have saved in ten years, we need to calculate the monthly savings for each and then multiply by the number of months in ten years.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. In ten years, which is 120 months, Rong will have saved:
20 coins/month * 120 months = 2400 coins

Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong each month. To find out how many more coins that is, we calculate:
2/5 * 20 coins = 8 coins

So Neil saves 8 coins more than Rong each month, which means Neil saves:
20 coins + 8 coins = 28 coins/month

In ten years, Neil will have saved:
28 coins/month * 120 months = 3360 coins

To find the total number of coins they have saved together in ten years, we add Rong's and Neil's savings:
2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The cost of the two vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.
2. Let the total bill be T. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so the cost of the heartworm check is 0.60 * T.
3. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check, so T = $40 + 0.60 * T.
4. We can solve for T by isolating it on one side of the equation:

   T - 0.60 * T = $40
   0.40 * T = $40
   T = $40 / 0.40
   T = $100

5. John's total bill is $100.
6. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is $125 - $100.

Now, let's calculate the final amount John leaves with:

$125 - $100 = $25

"To find the price of the crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum them up.

1. The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple. Since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs:
   \( 0.5 \times 2 = 1.0 \) dollar.

2. The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana. Since one banana costs $1.0, one orange costs:
   \( 1.0 \times 3 = 3.0 \) dollars.

Now, we can calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:

- The total cost for bananas in the crate is:
  \( 5 \times 1.0 = 5.0 \) dollars.

- The total cost for apples in the crate is:
  \( 12 \times 0.5 = 6.0 \) dollars.

- The total cost for oranges in the crate is:
  \( 7 \times 3.0 = 21.0 \) dollars.

Finally, we sum up the costs to get the total price of the crate:

\( 5.0 + 6.0 + 21.0 = 32.0 \) dollars.

"To find the total number of square feet of Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the number of squares of each color and then sum them up.

1. Red squares: 14
2. Blue squares: 14 (red) + 4 = 18
3. Green squares: 18 (blue) + 6 = 24
4. White squares: 24 (green) - 12 = 12

Now, we add up all the squares to get the total number of squares, which is equal to the total square feet since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot.

Total square feet = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white)

Total square feet = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12
Total square feet = 68

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of chairs required for the function and compare it to the number of chairs Mia's restaurant currently has.

First, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed:
- There are 42 adults, and each adult will need a regular chair.
- There are 15 babies, and each baby will need a high chair.

Total chairs needed = 42 (for adults) + 15 (for babies) = 57 chairs

Next, let's determine how many chairs the restaurant currently has:
- The restaurant has 8 high chairs.
- The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, so it has 5 * 8 = 40 regular chairs.

Total chairs available = 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48 chairs

Now, we can find out how many more chairs are needed:
Chairs needed - Chairs available = 57 - 48 = 9 chairs

Mia has to get 9 more chairs.

1. Calculate the number of bucks in the field.
2. Calculate the number of 8-point bucks from the total number of bucks.

Step 1: Calculate the number of bucks.
50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks, so:
50 deer * 50% = 50 deer * 0.5 = 25 bucks

Step 2: Calculate the number of 8-point bucks.
20 percent of the 25 bucks are 8 points, so:
25 bucks * 20% = 25 bucks * 0.2 = 5 8-point bucks

Therefore, there are 5 8-point bucks in the field.

"To find out how many points the class is missing to go on the trip, we need to calculate the total points collected by all the students and then subtract this from the minimum threshold of 400 points.

1. Adam has collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. To find out how many points Betty has, we calculate 30% of Adam's points and add it to Adam's points:
   Betty's points = Adam's points + (30% of Adam's points)
   Betty's points = 50 + (0.30 * 50)
   Betty's points = 50 + 15
   Betty's points = 65
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty:
   Tom's points = Betty's points - 30
   Tom's points = 65 - 30
   Tom's points = 35
4. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom:
   Martha's points = 3 * Tom's points
   Martha's points = 3 * 35
   Martha's points = 105

Now, let's add up all the points collected by the students:
Total points = Adam's points + Betty's points + Tom's points + Martha's points
Total points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105
Total points = 255

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points, so the class is missing:
Missing points = Minimum threshold - Total points
Missing points = 400 - 255
Missing points = 145

"Greta's paycheck is $2400.00.

First, she puts 50% of her pay into her retirement account:
50% of $2400.00 = 0.50 * $2400.00 = $1200.00

Next, she uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment:
20% of $2400.00 = 0.20 * $2400.00 = $480.00

Now, we subtract the amount she put into her retirement and the car payment from her total paycheck to find out how much she has left:
$2400.00 - $1200.00 - $480.00 = $720.00

So, Greta has $720.00 left to spend.

"To find out how many fireworks Hannah will see in total, we need to calculate the number of fireworks from the city's display that she can see and add the number of fireworks she will set off in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks in the city's display:
15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we calculate:
40% of 300 fireworks = 0.40 * 300 = 120 fireworks

Next, we calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:
3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks

Now, we add the fireworks Hannah will see from the city's display to the fireworks she will set off:

1. Calculate the total number of people in the group.
2. Determine the total number of drinks and snacks that can be held by the seats.
3. Calculate the total cost of the drinks and snacks.

Step 1: Total number of people
Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:
13 + 7 = 20 people

Step 2: Total number of drinks and snacks
Each seat can hold two drinks and three snacks. Since there are 20 people, and each person saves a seat, there are 20 seats. Therefore, the total number of drinks and snacks is:
Drinks: 20 seats * 2 drinks/seat = 40 drinks
Snacks: 20 seats * 3 snacks/seat = 60 snacks

Step 3: Total cost of drinks and snacks
Each drink and snack costs $2, so the total cost is:
Cost of drinks: 40 drinks * $2/drink = $80
Cost of snacks: 60 snacks * $2/snack = $120

The total amount spent on drinks and snacks is:

Next, we need to find out how much more money they need to reach their goal:
$6300 goal - $2100 raised = $4200 still needed.

Now, we calculate how many more hours they need to fundraise to raise the remaining $4200:
$4200 needed / $700 per hour = 6 hours.

Since they have already fundraised for 3 hours, the total number of hours they need to fundraise is:

"To find the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the percent of the river's water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract that from the total percent of water used by the city to find the non-industrial use.

Step 1: The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes.
So, the industrial water use is 40% * 80% = 0.40 * 0.80 = 0.32 or 32% of the river's total water.

Step 2: The total water use by the city is 40%, and we subtract the industrial use to find the non-industrial use.
So, the non-industrial water use is 40% - 32% = 8%.

Therefore, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

"To find the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to calculate the number of taps for each foot separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the number of taps for the right foot:
- For the 3 minutes with her arms at her sides, she taps at 300 taps per minute.
- For the 2 minutes with her arms raised, she taps at 200 taps per minute.

Right foot taps:
(3 minutes * 300 taps/minute) + (2 minutes * 200 taps/minute) = 900 taps + 400 taps = 1300 taps

Next, we calculate the number of taps for the left foot:
- For the 3 minutes with her arms at her sides, she taps at 250 taps per minute.
- For the 2 minutes with her arms raised, she taps at 200 taps per minute.

Left foot taps:
(3 minutes * 250 taps/minute) + (2 minutes * 200 taps/minute) = 750 taps + 400 taps = 1150 taps

Now, we add the taps from both feet to get the combined total:
1300 taps (right foot) + 1150 taps (left foot) = 2450 taps

"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of the damage to his car if the pothole is not fixed and compare it to the cost of fixing the pothole himself, including the fine and the cost of the asphalt.

Cost of damage to car if pothole is not fixed: $450
Cost of the fine for unauthorized road maintenance: $120
Cost of 3 buckets of asphalt: 3 * $25 = $75

Total cost for Ron to fix the pothole himself: $120 + $75 = $195

Money saved by fixing the pothole: $450 - $195 = $255

"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person ate and then subtract that from the total number of slices available.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, they each ate:
2/3 * 12 = 8 slices

The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas, so they each ate:
3/4 * 12 = 9 slices

Now, we calculate the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends:
3 people * 8 slices/person = 24 slices

And the total number of slices eaten by the other two friends:
2 people * 9 slices/person = 18 slices

The total number of slices eaten by all five friends is:
24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices

Since there were 5 pizzas and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices available was:
5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices available to find out how many slices were left:
60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices

"To find the average time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages, we first need to determine how long it takes the dog to eat nine sausages.

The cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages. The dog takes 2/3 of the time the cat takes, so we calculate the dog's time as follows:

Dog's time = 2/3 * Cat's time
Dog's time = 2/3 * 30 minutes
Dog's time = 20 minutes

Now we have the time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages:
- Cat's time: 30 minutes
- Dog's time: 20 minutes

To find the average time, we add the two times together and divide by 2 (since there are two animals):

Average time = (Cat's time + Dog's time) / 2
Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2
Average time = 50 minutes / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches.

Topher's shoe length in inches is:
8 feet * 12 inches/foot + 4 inches = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. We can set up the following equation to represent this relationship, where \( b \) is the length of Bobby's shoe in inches:

100 inches = 9 * b + 10 inches

Now, we solve for \( b \):

100 inches - 10 inches = 9 * b
90 inches = 9 * b
b = 90 inches / 9
b = 10 inches

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To find out how many windows Hannah smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, each with 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.
- The total number of windows in the students' cars is 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.
- A quarter of the students' cars' windows is 256 windows * 1/4 = 64 windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, each with 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows.
- The total number of windows in the teachers' cars is 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.
- Three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows is 64 windows * 3/4 = 48 windows.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed in the students' cars to the number of windows smashed in the teachers' cars to get the total number of windows smashed:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (students' windows) + 48 (teachers' windows) = 112 windows.

"To find the percentage of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools together and then divide by the total number of spools. After that, we multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

Number of blue spools = Number of light blue spools + Number of dark blue spools
Number of blue spools = 15 + 45
Number of blue spools = 60

Total number of spools = Number of light blue spools + Number of dark blue spools + Number of light green spools + Number of dark green spools
Total number of spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50
Total number of spools = 150

Percentage of blue spools = (Number of blue spools / Total number of spools) * 100
Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100
Percentage of blue spools = 0.4 * 100
Percentage of blue spools = 40

"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of people who had voted by midday.
2. Subtract the number of people who voted by midday from the total to find the number of people who had not voted by midday.
3. Calculate the number of people who voted between midday and 16:00.
4. Subtract the number of people who voted between midday and 16:00 from the number of people who had not voted by midday to find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Number of people who voted by midday:
   \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 5000 = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \)

2. Number of people who had not voted by midday:
   5000 - 2000 = 3000

3. Number of people who voted between midday and 16:00:
   \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining 3000 = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \)

4. Number of people who had not voted by 16:00:

"To find out how many boxes of graham crackers are needed, we first need to calculate the total number of smores that will be made.

The number of smores the kids will eat is:
9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores

The number of smores the adults will eat is:
6 adults * 1 smore/adult = 6 smores

The total number of smores needed is:
18 smores (kids) + 6 smores (adults) = 24 smores

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores, we need to find out how many sleeves are required for 24 smores:
24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

There are 3 sleeves in a box, so the number of boxes needed is:
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves/box = 1 box

Therefore, they will need 1 box of graham crackers.

First, we calculate Dora's father's age:
Dora's father's age = 8 + 2 * 15
Dora's father's age = 8 + 30
Dora's father's age = 38 years

Next, we calculate Dora's mother's age:
Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4
Dora's mother's age = 34 years

Now, we can calculate the total combined age:
Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

"To find out how many votes candidate C received, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of votes candidate A received.
2. Calculate the number of votes candidate B received, which is 50% more than candidate A's votes.
3. Subtract the votes of candidates A and B from the total number of votes to find the votes for candidate C.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Candidate A's votes: 20% of 100 voters = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes
2. Candidate B's votes: 50% more than candidate A's votes = 20 votes + (0.50 * 20 votes) = 20 votes + 10 votes = 30 votes
3. Candidate C's votes: Total votes - (Candidate A's votes + Candidate B's votes) = 100 votes - (20 votes + 30 votes) = 100 votes - 50 votes = 50 votes

Candidate C received 50 votes.

"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

Beck's apples = Boris's apples - 23
Beck's apples = 100 - 23
Beck's apples = 77

Now, if Boris gives Beck 10 apples, we need to adjust the number of apples each has:

Boris's new number of apples = Boris's original apples - 10
Boris's new number of apples = 100 - 10
Boris's new number of apples = 90

Beck's new number of apples = Beck's original apples + 10
Beck's new number of apples = 77 + 10
Beck's new number of apples = 87

Now we can find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after the transaction:

Fewer apples = Boris's new number of apples - Beck's new number of apples
Fewer apples = 90 - 87
Fewer apples = 3

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for the ice cubes and then subtract that from the initial 32 ounces.

First, we calculate the water used for each type of ice cube:

- Giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces/cube = 12 ounces
- Medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces
- Small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 4 ounces

Now, we add up the water used for all the cubes:

12 ounces (giant) + 14 ounces (medium) + 4 ounces (small) = 30 ounces

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:

32 ounces (initial) - 30 ounces (used) = 2 ounces

So, Peter has 2 ounces of water left.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let the number of books Steven has be \( S \).
2. According to the problem, Clara has two times as many books as Steven, so Clara has \( 2S \) books.
3. We are given that Clara has 20 books, so \( 2S = 20 \).
4. Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 20 / 2 = 10 \). So, Steven has 10 books.
5. Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has \( S + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \) books.
6. To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has: \( 20 - 16 = 4 \).

Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. We know that a gallon jar costs $5 and that it is $2 more than a half-gallon jar. So, we can set up the following equation to find the cost of a half-gallon jar:

Cost of a gallon jar = Cost of a half-gallon jar + $2

Given that the cost of a gallon jar is $5, we can substitute that into the equation:

$5 = Cost of a half-gallon jar + $2

Now, we can solve for the cost of a half-gallon jar:

Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Now that we know the cost of a half-gallon jar, we can calculate the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars:

Total cost = (Cost of a gallon jar * Number of gallon jars) + (Cost of a half-gallon jar * Number of half-gallon jars)
Total cost = ($5 * 10) + ($3 * 16)

Now we calculate the total cost:

Total cost = ($5 * 10) + ($3 * 16)
Total cost = $50 + $48
Total cost = $98

So, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is:

$98"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many students like to play video games. We know the following:

- Total number of students = 50
- Number of students who like to bake = 10
- Number of students who like to play basketball = 5
- Number of students who like to play music = 2 * (number of students who like to play basketball) = 2 * 5 = 10

Now, we can calculate the number of students who like to play video games by subtracting the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music from the total number of students.

Number of students who like to play video games = Total number of students - (Number of students who like to bake + Number of students who like to play basketball + Number of students who like to play music)

Let's do the math:

Number of students who like to play video games = 50 - (10 + 5 + 10) = 50 - 25 = 25

So, the number of students who like to play video games is 25.

Next, we need to find out how many of those students are girls. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, we can calculate the number of girls in one class as follows:

40% of 40 students = 0.40 * 40 = 16 girls

Now, to find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in the class:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons:
   - 90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Since 1 large button is worth 3 small stickers, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

3. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons:
   - 50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Since 1 large sticker is worth 1 large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

4. She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons:
   - She has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
   - Since 1 large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

5. Now, let's count the total number of buttons she has:
   - Large buttons: 9 (from small stickers) + 20 (from large stickers) = 29 large buttons.
   - Small buttons: 60 (from large stickers) + (30 - 27) (remaining small stickers) = 60 + 3 = 63 small buttons.

6. The total number of buttons is the sum of large and small buttons:
   - Total buttons = 29 large buttons + 63 small buttons.

Since a large button is worth 3 small buttons, we can convert all the large buttons to small buttons to get the total count in small buttons:
   - 29 large buttons * 3 small buttons/large button = 87 small buttons.

Finally, we add the small buttons to the converted large buttons:
   - Total small buttons = 87 (converted from large) + 63 (small buttons) = 150 small buttons.

So, Lorraine has 150 buttons by the end.

"Let's denote the number of votes in favor of the new regulation as \( F \) and the number of votes against it as \( A \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, so we can write:

\[ F = 2A \]

Since the total number of people on the council is 33, the sum of the votes in favor and against must be 33:

\[ F + A = 33 \]

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second one:

\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now that we know the number of votes against the regulation is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor:

"To find out how many shirts Krissa needs to order, let's break down the information given:

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small as extra-small, so:
   \( 2 \times 11 = 22 \) students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so:
   \( 22 - 4 = 18 \) students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so:
   \( 18 / 2 = 9 \) students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so:
   \( 9 + 6 = 15 \) students need size extra-large.

Now, we add up all the shirts needed for each size:

\( 11 \) (extra-small) \( + 22 \) (small) \( + 18 \) (medium) \( + 9 \) (large) \( + 15 \) (extra-large) \( = 75 \)

So, Krissa needs to order a total of 75 shirts.

"To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of songs in all 20 playlists.
2. Multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song in hours.

Step 1: Total number of songs in 20 playlists
Total songs = Number of playlists * Number of songs per playlist
Total songs = 20 * 300
Total songs = 6000

Step 2: Total hours for all songs
Total hours = Total songs * Length of each song in hours
Total hours = 6000 * 10
Total hours = 60000

The 20 playlists will last for a total of 60000 hours.

"To find out how many puppies Jana has, we can work backwards from the information given.

First, we know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. This means that the total number of Pomeranians is three times the number of Pomeranian girls, because 1/3 of the Pomeranians = 6, so:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3 = 18

Next, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. If 18 is two thirds of the total number of puppies, we can find the total number of puppies by dividing the number of Pomeranians by 2 and then multiplying by 3:

Total Puppies = (18 / 2) * 3 = 9 * 3 = 27

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total.

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \). According to the problem, the second house will need twice as many cases as the first house, which is \( 2x \), and the third house will need double the amount of the first house, which is \( 2x \) as well.

The total number of cases for all three houses is 250, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

The third house needs double the amount of the first house, so it will need:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To find out how many fruits George has in total, we first need to calculate the number of pears he has based on the information that he has 45% more pears than bananas.

If George has 200 bananas, and he has 45% more pears than bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

Number of pears = Number of bananas + (45% of Number of bananas)
Number of pears = 200 + (0.45 * 200)
Number of pears = 200 + 90
Number of pears = 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears:

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
Total number of fruits = 200 + 290
Total number of fruits = 490

"To calculate Tanya's earnings, we need to consider her hourly rate and the additional daily rate if she teaches more than 3 classes.

On Monday:
- She teaches 4 classes, which is more than 3, so she gets an additional $5 for the day.
- She teaches for 5 hours at $15 per hour, so her earnings for the hours are 5 * $15 = $75.
- Adding the additional daily rate, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday:
- She teaches 2 classes, which is not more than 3, so she does not get the additional $5 for the day.
- She teaches for 2 hours at $15 per hour, so her earnings for the hours are 2 * $15 = $30.
- Since she does not get the additional daily rate, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Adding the earnings from both days:
- Total earnings = Monday's earnings + Wednesday's earnings = $80 + $30 = $110.

Therefore, Tanya earned $110 for these two days of teaching.

"To calculate the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to consider the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent at the museum, and the time spent driving back home.

First, we calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles and he drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time to drive to the museum is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time to museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since the trip back home is the same distance and speed, the time to drive back is also 2 hours.

Now, we add the time spent at the museum, which is 6 hours.

Total time gone from home = Time to museum + Time at museum + Time back home
Total time gone from home = 2 hours + 6 hours + 2 hours
Total time gone from home = 10 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts:

1. Calculate the number of movies that are part of a series.
2. Calculate the cost of the series movies.
3. Calculate the number of remaining movies after the series movies are accounted for.
4. Calculate the number of older movies from the remaining movies.
5. Calculate the cost of the older movies.
6. Calculate the number of normal movies from the remaining movies.
7. Calculate the cost of the normal movies.
8. Sum up the costs from steps 2, 5, and 7 to get the total cost.

Let's start with step 1:

1. Number of series movies = 1/3 of 600 = 600 / 3 = 200 movies

2. Cost of series movies = 200 movies * $6 = $1200

3. Number of remaining movies = 600 - 200 = 400 movies

4. Number of older movies = 40% of 400 = 0.40 * 400 = 160 movies

5. Cost of older movies = 160 movies * $5 = $800

6. Number of normal movies = 400 - 160 = 240 movies

7. Cost of normal movies = 240 movies * $10 = $2400

8. Total cost = Cost of series movies + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
             = $1200 + $800 + $2400
             = $4400

The total cost of replacing the movies is $4400.

"To find the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance they covered while driving and the distance they covered while hiking.

First, let's calculate the distance they drove:
- They drove for 6 hours in total.
- They hiked for 1.5 hours, so they drove for 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours.
- They drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
- The distance they drove is 4.5 hours * 50 miles/hour = 225 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance they hiked:
- They hiked at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
- Half their driving speed is 50 miles per hour / 2 = 25 miles per hour.
- Their hiking speed is 25 miles per hour - 5 miles per hour = 20 miles per hour.
- The distance they hiked is 1.5 hours * 20 miles/hour = 30 miles.

Finally, we add the distances together to get the total distance to the vacation spot:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Emma jumps on \( E \) enemies, collects \( B \) berries, and finishes the level with \( T \) seconds left on the timer.

Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies, collects \( B + 3 \) berries, and finishes the level with \( T - 4 \) seconds left on the timer.

The score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Emma's score} = 10E + 5B + 30T \]

The score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4) \]
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 \]
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \]

The difference between their scores is:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Ava's score} - \text{Emma's score} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = -25 \]

So, the difference between their two scores is -25, which means Emma's score is 25 points higher than Ava's.

"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish Bob bought as \( W \).

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish, making a total of 7 fish. After buying 17 more fish, he had a total of \( 7 + 17 = 24 \) fish.

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. So, the equation representing this relationship is:

\[ (3 + O) = 2 \times (4 + W) \]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so:

\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( 3 + O = 2 \times (4 + W) \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

Let's solve the system of equations. First, we can simplify the first equation:

\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O = 2W + 5 \]

Now we can substitute \( O \) from the second equation:

\[ 2W + 5 + W = 17 \]
\[ 3W + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3W = 12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.
3. Multiply the total monthly salary by the number of months (3) to get the total amount paid after three months.

Step 1: Total number of employees after three months
Initial number of employees = 200
Number of new employees hired each month = 20
Number of months = 3

Total number of new employees hired in three months = 20 * 3 = 60
Total number of employees after three months = Initial number + New hires
Total number of employees after three months = 200 + 60 = 260

Step 2: Total monthly salary for all employees
Monthly salary per employee = $4000
Total monthly salary for all employees = Total number of employees * Monthly salary per employee
Total monthly salary for all employees = 260 * $4000 = $1,040,000

Step 3: Total amount paid after three months
Total amount paid after three months = Total monthly salary * Number of months
Total amount paid after three months = $1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $3,120,000.

"To find out how long the choir will be caroling, we need to calculate the total time for singing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and ""Jingle Bells"" once.

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long, and they will sing it twice, so:
150 seconds * 2 = 300 seconds

""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long, and they will sing it once, so:
240 seconds * 1 = 240 seconds

Now, we add the time for both songs together to get the total caroling time:
300 seconds + 240 seconds = 540 seconds

Therefore, the choir will be caroling for a total of 540 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the hourly rates for both Billy and Sally, and then determine how much each of them earns for 20 hours of work. Finally, we will find the difference between their earnings.

1. Billy's starting hourly rate: $10.00
2. Billy's hourly rate after 2 months: $10.00 + $0.50 = $10.50
3. Billy's hourly rate on his first anniversary: $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50

Sally's starting hourly rate is $0.50 more than Billy's starting rate, so:
4. Sally's hourly rate: $10.00 + $0.50 = $10.50

Now, we calculate their earnings for 20 hours of work:
5. Billy's earnings for 20 hours: $11.50 * 20 = $230.00
6. Sally's earnings for 20 hours: $10.50 * 20 = $210.00

Finally, we find the difference between Billy's and Sally's earnings:
7. Difference in earnings: $230.00 - $210.00 = $20.00

Billy will earn $20.00 more than Sally for 20 hours of work.

"To find out how many points Nikita scored, we first need to calculate half of Pierson's score and then add 11 to it.

Half of Pierson's score is:
278 / 2 = 139

Nikita scored 11 more than this, so:
139 + 11 = 150

Now, to find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we add their individual scores together:
278 + 150 = 428

The total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"To find out how many trees will be planted at the end of the campaign, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class.
- Therefore, the total number of students is 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students.
- Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000 trees.

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- There are 40 classes with 3 teachers per class.
- Therefore, the total number of teachers is 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers.
- Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees.

Now, we add the number of trees planted by students and teachers to get the total number of trees planted:
- Total trees planted = trees planted by students + trees planted by teachers
- Total trees planted = 1000 trees + 240 trees = 1240 trees.

"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy to make them 30% of her collection, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14 stuffed animals.

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as \( x \). After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to be 30% of the total, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now we solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x - 0.30 \times x = 0.30 \times 14 \]
\[ 0.70 \times x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats to make them 30% of her collection.

"Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so for 2 weeks, that's 14 days. Half an hour is 0.5 hours, so:

0.5 hours/day * 14 days = 7 hours

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. That's 7 days, so:

2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours

Adding the two amounts together gives us the total hours Kris has played:

7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours

Kris is trying to earn an achievement for playing a total of 30 hours. To find out how many hours she still needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required:

30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours

Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement.

"To find out how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car will travel in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles

The difference in distance between the two cars after 2 hours will be:
140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

So, the two cars will be 20 miles apart after 2 hours.

"To find out how much James paid for the ring, we need to calculate the total cost of the materials and then add the 30% premium.

The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. So, the total cost of the materials is:

$600 (diamond) + $300 (gold) = $900

Next, we calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of the materials:

30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the materials to find out the final amount James paid:

$900 (materials) + $270 (premium) = $1170

So, James paid $1170 for the ring.

"To find the school's overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and divide it by the total number of students.

First, we calculate the pass rate for each grade:

- Third graders: 340 out of 500 passed, which is a pass rate of 340/500.
- Fourth graders: 40 out of 100 passed, which is a pass rate of 40/100.
- Fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it's 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. Since there are 400 fifth graders, the number who passed is 400 * (80/100) = 320.

Now, we calculate the total number of students and the total number of students who passed:

- Total students = 500 (third graders) + 100 (fourth graders) + 400 (fifth graders) = 1000 students.
- Total passed = 340 (third graders) + 40 (fourth graders) + 320 (fifth graders) = 700 students.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

Overall pass rate = 700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made with the total number of glass chips.
3. Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, divide the total square inches by 3 to find the length in inches.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total number of glass chips:
   Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips.
   Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips

2. Total square inches of mosaic:
   It takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch.
   Total square inches = 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches

3. Length of the mosaic:
   The mosaic is 3 inches tall, so to find the length, we divide the total square inches by the height.
   Length = Total square inches / Height
   Length = 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea that was consumed and then add the 10 quarts that were left over. After that, we convert the total quarts to gallons, knowing that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts.

First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students who each drank 1.5 quarts:
4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts

Next, we calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the 16 students who each drank 2 quarts:
16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts

Now, we add the tea consumed by all the students together:
6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts

Then, we add the 10 quarts that were left over to find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party:
38 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts

Finally, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
48 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 12 gallons

"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150, which means he sold all of his initial stock and needed 50 more to fulfill the orders. He then ordered 100 more candies. To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell to sell all of his candy, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has after the new order and subtract the number he has already sold.

Initial candies: 100
Candies sold: 150
Additional candies ordered: 100

Total candies after the new order: 100 (initial) + 100 (additional) = 200
Candies still needed to be sold: 200 (total after order) - 150 (already sold) = 50

Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month, starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year, and doubling the number of students at the end of each month. We will then find the difference between the number of students at the end of May and the initial number of students at the beginning of the year.

Let's calculate the number of students at the end of each month:

- End of January: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- End of February: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- End of March: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- End of April: 80 * 2 = 160 students
- End of May: 160 * 2 = 320 students

Now, to find the number of additional students that joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students (10) from the number of students at the end of May (320):

320 - 10 = 310

So, 310 additional students would have joined by the end of May.

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to know how many days he worked during the week. A typical week has 7 days. We can then divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch to find out the total number of branches he climbed during the week. Finally, we divide that number by the number of days in the week to get the average number of branches climbed per day.

Let's do the math:

1. Total money made: $105
2. Cost per branch: $0.25
3. Total branches climbed in the week: $105 / $0.25
4. Number of days in a week: 7
5. Average branches climbed per day: (Total branches climbed in the week) / 7

Now, let's calculate:

Total branches climbed in the week = $105 / $0.25 = 420 branches

Average branches climbed per day = 420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches per day

"To find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the number of petals for each type of flower Rose picked, subtract the petals from the flowers she dropped, and then sum the remaining petals.

1. For the first set of flowers, she picked 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
   3 flowers * 5 petals/flower = 15 petals

2. For the second set of flowers, she picked 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
   4 flowers * 6 petals/flower = 24 petals

3. For the third set of flowers, she picked 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
   5 flowers * 4 petals/flower = 20 petals

4. For the last set of flowers, she picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
   6 flowers * 7 petals/flower = 42 petals

Now, we add up all the petals:
15 petals + 24 petals + 20 petals + 42 petals = 101 petals

Since she dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract the petals of one flower from each set:
1 flower * 5 petals/flower = 5 petals
1 flower * 6 petals/flower = 6 petals
1 flower * 4 petals/flower = 4 petals
1 flower * 7 petals/flower = 7 petals

Total petals from the dropped flowers:
5 petals + 6 petals + 4 petals + 7 petals = 22 petals

Subtract the petals from the dropped flowers from the total:
101 petals - 22 petals = 79 petals

The total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money spent by Jack and his three friends playing the arcade games for 4 hours.

First, let's determine how long each person can play with one quarter:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
- Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes with one quarter.
- One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes with one quarter.

Next, we need to calculate how many quarters each person will use in 4 hours (240 minutes):
- Jack: 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters
- Two friends: 240 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters each
- One friend: 240 minutes / 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters

Now, we calculate the total number of quarters used:
- Jack: 12 quarters
- Two friends: 24 quarters each, so 24 * 2 = 48 quarters
- One friend: 8 quarters

Total quarters used = 12 (Jack) + 48 (two friends) + 8 (one friend) = 68 quarters

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is:
68 quarters * $0.25 per quarter = $17.00

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient Tanya uses:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so \( s = 2z \).

The total volume of the scrub is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:

\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]

Simplifying the equation, we get:

\[ 2z + 2s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

Since \( s = 2z \), we can substitute \( 2z \) for \( s \) in the equation:

\[ 2z + 4(2z) = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 8z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now that we know \( z \), we can find \( s \):

\[ s = 2z = 2(1) = 2 \]

And the amount of oil is:

\[ 2s = 2(2) = 4 \]

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

Julie's points in the first game = Sasha's points in the first game - 4
Julie's points in the first game = 14 - 4
Julie's points in the first game = 10

Now, Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game, so:

Sasha's points in the second game = Julie's points in the first game - 6
Sasha's points in the second game = 10 - 6
Sasha's points in the second game = 4

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the terms with \( P \):

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( P \):

\[ P = 47 \]

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick has:

\[ 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]

"To calculate how much money Milly will lose, we need to consider the cost of shipping the book back and the amount she will be refunded by Amazon.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost:
- The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
- The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.

Shipping cost for weight = 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40
Shipping cost for distance = 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Next, let's calculate the refund amount:
- The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.

Refund amount = $32 * 75% = $32 * 0.75 = $24.00

Now, let's calculate the total loss:
- Milly will lose the difference between the book's cost and the refund, plus the shipping cost.

Total loss = (Book cost - Refund amount) + Shipping cost
Total loss = ($32 - $24) + $3.00

1. Time spent recording TikTok videos:
- Each video is 4 minutes long.
- She records 18 videos each week.
- In a month with four weeks, she records 18 videos/week * 4 weeks = 72 videos.
- The total time spent recording videos is 72 videos * 4 minutes/video = 288 minutes.

2. Time spent writing amateur songs:
- She spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
- In a month with four weeks, she spends 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours.

"To calculate the total cost for Angela, we need to determine the cost of the additional items she needs installed beyond what is included in the standard installation package.

The standard installation package includes:
- 4 mirrors
- 2 shelves (not needed by Angela)
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

Angela has:
- 6 mirrors (2 additional mirrors needed)
- 2 chandeliers (1 additional chandelier needed)
- 20 pictures (10 additional pictures needed)

The cost for additional items is $15.00 per item. So, we need to calculate the cost for the 2 additional mirrors, 1 additional chandelier, and 10 additional pictures.

The total number of additional items is:
2 (mirrors) + 1 (chandelier) + 10 (pictures) = 13 items

The cost for the additional items is:
13 items * $15.00/item = $195.00

Now, we add the cost of the additional items to the standard installation cost:
$129.00 (standard installation) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00

Therefore, the total cost for Angela will be:
$324.00

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. First, we know that Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find out how much more, we calculate 40% of Anthony's savings: 40% of $30.00 = 0.40 * $30.00 = $12.00.
4. Therefore, Roy has saved $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

So, Roy has $42.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the height each person can lift a mountain, starting from Pompei and working our way up to Naruto.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 inches.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 4 * 12 inches.

Now, let's calculate the height Naruto can lift a mountain in inches and then convert it to feet (1 foot = 12 inches).

Naruto's mountain height in inches:
10 * 4 * 12 = 480 inches

Now, convert inches to feet:
480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour. For the first part of his journey, he travels for 4 hours, so he covers:

8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles

After taking some rest, he continues his journey for another 6 hours, covering:

8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

To find the total distance traveled, we add the two distances together:

32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then calculate the time it would take for the turtles to travel the same distance.

First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can assume that the total distance is the same for one kangaroo, as they are traveling at the same speed. Therefore, one kangaroo would also take 18 hours to travel the same distance.

Now, if a turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, it would take twice as long for a turtle to travel the same distance. So, one turtle would take 18 hours * 2 = 36 hours to travel across the highway.

Since we have four turtles, and they are all traveling at the same speed, the time it takes for them to travel the distance does not change with the number of turtles, as they are not helping each other to travel faster. Each turtle will still take 36 hours to travel the distance individually.

Therefore, it will take 36 hours for one turtle, and consequently, it will also take 36 hours for four turtles to travel across the highway.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Kora made 20 dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, to find out how many dishes they all made together, we add the number of dishes each person made:

Kora's dishes + Rory's dishes + Jada's dishes = Total dishes
20 + 40 + 80 = 140

So, together they made 140 clay dishes.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after the trade-in, her part-time job pay, and her mom's contribution, and then subtract the amount she still needs to buy the laptop.

The cost of the new laptop after the trade-in is:
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika has received the following amounts:
- Part-time job pay: $150
- Her mom's contribution: $80

The total amount Erika has received from her job and her mom is:
$150 + $80 = $230

Erika still needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means the total amount she has, including the money in her purse, is:
$400 (laptop cost after trade-in) - $50 (amount still needed) = $350

To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we subtract the amount she has received from her job and her mom from the total amount she has:
$350 (total amount) - $230 (job and mom's contribution) = $120

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To find out how many apple slices are left, we need to calculate the total number of slices Adam gets from slicing the apples and then subtract the number of slices he eats.

First, we calculate the number of slices from the large apples:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

Next, we calculate the number of slices from the small apples:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Now, we add the slices from the large and small apples to get the total number of slices:
15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract that from the total number of slices:
30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices

The number of apple slices left is:

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many cows are required in total:

25 liters/day / 5 liters/cow/day = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, the number of additional cows needed is:

5 cows - 3 cows = 2 cows

2. The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the remaining length is 12 mm * 2/3 = 8 mm.
3. The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the remaining length is 12 mm * 1/2 = 6 mm.

Now, we add the remaining lengths together to get the total length of the glue that is not used:

2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

We know that:
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, let's find out how many students are good at both subjects. We can do this by subtracting the number of students who are good at only one subject from the total number of students:

Total number of students = 20
Number of students good at math only = 5
Number of students good at English only = 8

Number of students good at both = Total number of students - (Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only)
Number of students good at both = 20 - (5 + 8)
Number of students good at both = 20 - 13
Number of students good at both = 7

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the number of students who are good at math only to the number of students who are good at both:

Number of students good at math = Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at both
Number of students good at math = 5 + 7
Number of students good at math = 12

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group will take, including the time to get on stage, perform, and exit the stage. We also need to account for the intermission.

Each group will take:
2 minutes to get on stage
6 minutes to perform
2 minutes to exit the stage
Total time per group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. We need to subtract the 10-minute intermission from the total concert time to find out how much time is available for the groups to perform.

Total time available for groups = 120 minutes - 10 minutes (intermission) = 110 minutes

Now, we divide the total time available for groups by the time each group takes to find out how many groups can perform.

Number of groups = Total time available for groups / Time per group
Number of groups = 110 minutes / 10 minutes per group
Number of groups = 11

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to use the formula for simple interest:

\[ A = P(1 + rt) \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

In this case, the interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which means \( r = \frac{3}{4} \) of \( P \) per year. However, the interest rate should be a fraction of the principal, not the principal itself. Since the interest is three-quarters of the original amount, the interest rate is actually 75% or 0.75.

Let's plug in the values:

- \( P = 300 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.75 \)
- \( t = 3 \) years

Now we can calculate the interest earned over 3 years:

\[ \text{Interest} = P \times r \times t = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 \]

\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \]

\[ \text{Interest} = 675 \]

Now, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount:

\[ A = P + \text{Interest} \]

\[ A = 300 + 675 \]

\[ A = 975 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $975.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the number of white shirts with collars:
   Half of the 40 white shirts have collars, so:
   40 / 2 = 20 white shirts with collars.

2. Calculate the number of white shirts with no collars:
   Since there are 40 white shirts in total and 20 have collars, the remaining shirts have no collars:
   40 - 20 = 20 white shirts with no collars.

3. Calculate the number of floral shirts with buttons:
   We are given that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.

4. Calculate the number of floral shirts with no buttons:
   There are 50 floral shirts in total, so the number of floral shirts with no buttons is:
   50 - 20 = 30 floral shirts with no buttons.

5. Calculate how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars:
   30 (floral shirts with no buttons) - 20 (white shirts with no collars) = 10 more floral shirts with no buttons.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y.

So, there are now 45 - 20 = 25 goats left in Farm Y.

Altogether, the number of goats left in the two farms is 45 (from Farm X) + 25 (from Farm Y) = 70 goats.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people infected each day, starting with the initial ten people and then accounting for the exponential growth due to each infected person infecting six others every day.

Day 0: 10 people are initially infected.
Day 1: Each of the 10 people infects 6 others, so 10 * 6 = 60 new people are infected, making the total 10 (initial) + 60 (new) = 70 people infected.
Day 2: Each of the 70 people now infects 6 others, so 70 * 6 = 420 new people are infected, making the total 70 (from Day 1) + 420 (new) = 490 people infected.
Day 3: Each of the 490 people now infects 6 others, so 490 * 6 = 2940 new people are infected, making the total 490 (from Day 2) + 2940 (new) = 3430 people infected.

However, this method of calculation is incorrect because it assumes that only the newly infected people from the previous day can infect others, whereas in reality, all infected people from all previous days can continue to infect others.

The correct method is to use the formula for exponential growth:

Total infected people after n days = Initial infected people * (1 + number of people each infected person infects)^n

In this case, the initial infected people are 10, the number of people each infected person infects is 6, and n is 3 days.

Total infected people after 3 days = 10 * (1 + 6)^3
Total infected people after 3 days = 10 * 7^3
Total infected people after 3 days = 10 * 343
Total infected people after 3 days = 3430

2. Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months.
3. Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 badges every month.

Now, let's calculate the number of badges each person earns in a year (12 months):

- Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months, so she earns 1/2 badge/month * 12 months/year = 6 badges/year.
- Wendy earns 3 badges/month * 12 months/year = 36 badges/year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:

2. A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)
3. S + A + F = 85 (Together, they have 85 books)

We can substitute the first two equations into the third to find the value of F.

First, we express S in terms of F using the second equation:
A = F - 12
S = (F - 12) + 25
S = F + 13

Now we substitute S and A in the third equation:

3F = 84
F = 28

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to determine how much each person pays per month and then divide that by 4 to get the weekly amount.

Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, so Keenan pays the remaining 40%.

The total monthly cost is $400.

Keenan's monthly share is 40% of $400:
\( Keenan's\ monthly\ share = 400 \times 0.40 \)

Now, to find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide the monthly share by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in the month):
\( Keenan's\ weekly\ share = \frac{Keenan's\ monthly\ share}{4} \)

Let's calculate it:

\( Keenan's\ monthly\ share = 400 \times 0.40 = 160 \)

\( Keenan's\ weekly\ share = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \)

So, Keenan spends $40 per week.

"To find out how many pieces of pizza Tobias has eaten so far, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the number of pieces he ate on the first day:
2/5 of 60 pieces = (2/5) * 60 = 24 pieces

Next, we know he ate 10 pieces on the second day.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces were left after the first two days:
60 pieces - 24 pieces (first day) - 10 pieces (second day) = 26 pieces remaining

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces:
7/13 of 26 pieces = (7/13) * 26 = 14 pieces

Finally, we sum up the pieces he ate over the three days:
24 pieces (first day) + 10 pieces (second day) + 14 pieces (third day) = 48 pieces

So, Tobias has eaten 48 pieces of pizza so far.

"To find out how much 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water will cost, we need to calculate the cost per bottle for each and then multiply by the number of bottles David wants to buy.

First, let's find the cost per bottle of soda:
7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, so the cost per bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

Next, let's find the cost per bottle of water:
4 bottles of water cost $8.00, so the cost per bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.
Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Total cost = Cost of 3 bottles of soda + Cost of 2 bottles of water = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

The final cost for David to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00.

"To find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts and then subtract that from the amount of money David has.

The cost of one bolt is $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts. So, the total cost of the bolts is:

16 bolts * $0.03/bolt = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the amount of money David has:

$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

So, after paying for the bolts, David has $12.00 left.

"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we first need to determine her hourly rate. We can do this by dividing the total amount she earned by the number of hours she worked.

Hourly rate = Total earnings / Number of hours
Hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours
Hourly rate = $11 per hour

Now that we know her hourly rate, we can calculate her earnings for 12 hours by multiplying her hourly rate by the number of hours she will work.

Earnings for 12 hours = Hourly rate * Number of hours
Earnings for 12 hours = $11 * 12
Earnings for 12 hours = $132

"To calculate Amy's total score, we need to determine how many points she earns from each type of question and then sum them up.

1. For the multiple-choice questions:
- There are 10 multiple-choice questions, and she answers 80% of them correctly.
- 80% of 10 is 0.80 * 10 = 8 questions.
- Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, she scores 8 * 1 = 8 points from multiple-choice questions.

2. For the true/false questions:
- There are 20 true/false questions, and she answers 90% of them correctly.
- 90% of 20 is 0.90 * 20 = 18 questions.
- Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, she scores 18 * 1 = 18 points from true/false questions.

3. For the long-answer questions:
- There are 5 long-answer questions, and she answers 60% of them correctly.
- 60% of 5 is 0.60 * 5 = 3 questions.
- Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points from long-answer questions.

Now, we add up the points from all the questions to get her total score:
8 (multiple-choice) + 18 (true/false) + 15 (long-answer) = 41 points.

"To find out how much money Isaias spent to buy the chickens he took to the market for sale, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Subtract the profit from the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

Step 1: Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them.
Number of chickens to sell = 300 * (3/5) = 180 chickens

Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
Isaias sells each chicken for $50.
Total revenue = 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000

Step 3: Subtract the profit from the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.
Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000.
Cost of the chickens = Total revenue - Profit
Cost of the chickens = $9000 - $2000 = $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000.

"To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we first need to determine how many glasses each of the boys sold. Since Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold a total of 32 glasses and Julie sold 14 glasses, we can subtract Julie's sales from the total to find out how many glasses the boys sold together.

32 glasses (total) - 14 glasses (Julie's sales) = 18 glasses (boys' sales combined)

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the boys' sales by 2 to find out how many each boy sold.

18 glasses (boys' sales combined) / 2 = 9 glasses (each boy's sales)

Now we know that Micah sold 9 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract Micah's sales from Julie's sales.

14 glasses (Julie's sales) - 9 glasses (Micah's sales) = 5 glasses

Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To find out how much money Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then sum them up.

1. The cost of doing her hair is $400.
2. The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the cost of doing her hair, so:
   \[ \text{Manicure cost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \]
3. The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure, so:
   \[ \text{Pedicure cost} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Now, we add up the costs of all the services:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Hair cost} + \text{Manicure cost} + \text{Pedicure cost} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 575 \]

So, Iris spent a total of $575 at the spa.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling her rope.
2. Determine the length of the new rope she can buy with the money from the sale.
3. Calculate the cost of the new rope.
4. Subtract the cost of the new rope from the total money received from the sale to find out how much money she will have left over.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Sarah's rope is 20 meters long and she sells it for $2 a meter.
   Total money from sale = 20 meters * $2/meter = $40

2. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter.
   To find out how much new rope she can buy, we divide the total money by the cost per meter of the new rope.
   Length of new rope = Total money from sale / Cost per meter of new rope
   Length of new rope = $40 / $1.5/meter = 26.666... meters

   Since Sarah can't buy a fraction of a meter, she can buy 26 meters of the new rope.

3. The cost of the new rope is:
   Cost of new rope = 26 meters * $1.5/meter = $39

4. The money left over after buying the new rope is:
   Money left over = Total money from sale - Cost of new rope
   Money left over = $40 - $39 = $1

So, Sarah will have $1 left over after she buys the new rope.

"To solve the problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can set up the following equation to find her current age:

Current age + 10 years = 18 years

Now, we solve for her current age:

Current age = 18 years - 10 years
Current age = 8 years

Now we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let's call the number of years it will take for her age to be three times her current age ""x"". We can set up the following equation:

Current age + x years = 3 * Current age

Substitute the current age (8 years) into the equation:

8 years + x years = 3 * 8 years
8 + x = 24

Now, solve for x:

x = 24 - 8
x = 16

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and then subtract that from her budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the bacon:
5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, so each pack costs $10 / 5 = $2.

Next, the cost of the chicken:
Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet costs $2 * 2 = $4.
The total cost for 6 packets of chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

Now, the cost of the strawberries:
Each pack of strawberries costs $4, so the total cost for 3 packs is 3 * $4 = $12.

Then, the cost of the apples:
Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack costs $4 / 2 = $2.
The total cost for 7 packs of apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
Total cost = cost of bacon + cost of chicken + cost of strawberries + cost of apples
Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14
Total cost = $60

Finally, we subtract the total cost from Kelly's budget to find out how much she has left:
Money left = Kelly’s budget - Total cost
Money left = $65 - $60
Money left = $5

"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we need to first determine the speed of a thingamabob, since the speed of a whirligig is based on the speed of a thingamabob.

We know that:
- A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.
- A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.

Let's denote the speed of a thingamabob as \( T \) meters per second. Then, the speed of a whatchamacallit is \( 11T \).

Since the speed of a whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:
\[ 11T = 121 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:
\[ T = \frac{121}{11} \]
\[ T = 11 \]

Now that we know the speed of a thingamabob is 11 meters per second, we can find the speed of a whirligig, which spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob:
\[ \text{Speed of a whirligig} = 5T \]
\[ \text{Speed of a whirligig} = 5 \times 11 \]
\[ \text{Speed of a whirligig} = 55 \]

So, the whirligig spins at 55 meters per second.

"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the cost of one carrot as \( c \).

The cost of the salad is $6.
The cost of the yogurt is half the price of the salad, so it is \( \frac{6}{2} = $3 \).

Ellen eats two carrots, so the cost for the carrots is \( 2c \).

The total cost for all the items she eats every day is $11.

So, the equation to represent this is:
\[ 2c + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Now, we can solve for \( c \):
\[ 2c + 9 = 11 \]
\[ 2c = 11 - 9 \]
\[ 2c = 2 \]
\[ c = \frac{2}{2} \]
\[ c = 1 \]

Therefore, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
2. We also know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work mowing his lawn.
3. We need to find out how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn to determine how much she made from mowing lawns in total.
4. Once we have the total amount made from mowing lawns, we can subtract it from the total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as J.

From the information given:
- The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3J times.
- The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn 5J times.

The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is the sum of the payments for mowing Joe's, Kamala's, and Alba's lawns. Since Joe paid $6, we can assume that Kamala and Alba paid the same rate per mow.

Total earnings from mowing lawns = (J + 3J + 5J) * $6
Total earnings from mowing lawns = 9J * $6
Total earnings from mowing lawns = 54J

We know that the total earnings from all activities (lemonade and mowing lawns) is $80, so we can set up the equation:

Earnings from lemonade + Earnings from mowing lawns = Total earnings
Earnings from lemonade + 54J = $80

However, we don't have the value of J, but we can find it by knowing that Joe paid $6, which means J = 1 (since the problem states ""Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work"" and we assume this is for one mow).

Now we can calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:
54J = 54 * 1 = $54

Finally, we can find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales:
Earnings from lemonade = Total earnings - Earnings from mowing lawns
Earnings from lemonade = $80 - $54
Earnings from lemonade = $26

So, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

- John rents his car 10 times a month.
- Each rental is for 3 hours.
- He gets paid $25 per hour.

Total earnings from renting = Number of rentals * Hours per rental * Rate per hour
Total earnings from renting = 10 * 3 * $25

Now, let's calculate the profit:

- Car payment is $500.
- Profit = Total earnings from renting - Car payment

Let's do the math:

Total earnings from renting = 10 * 3 * $25 = 30 * $25 = $750

"Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since he is eating with his adult wife and their two children, we need to calculate how much soup will be left after they all have one bowl for dinner.

1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls (since 4 adult bowls = 8 child bowls, 1 adult bowl = 8/4 = 2 child bowls).

Calvin and his wife will eat 2 adult bowls, which is equivalent to 4 child bowls (2 adult bowls * 2 child bowls/adult bowl).

Including the two children, the total number of child bowls needed for dinner is 4 (from the adults) + 2 (from the children) = 6 child bowls.

The pot can fill 8 child bowls, so after dinner, the number of child bowls left will be 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls.

Since there are two children, each child will be able to have 2 / 2 = 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"To find out how much material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can calculate the material needed for each type of mask and then add them together.

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- To make 20 small masks, we need to find out how many sets of 4 masks are in 20 masks, which is 20 / 4 = 5 sets.
- Since each set requires 2 yards of material, 5 sets will require 5 * 2 = 10 yards of material.

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- To make 8 large masks, we need to find out how many sets of 3 masks are in 8 masks, which is 8 / 3 ≈ 2.67 sets (we'll round up to 3 sets because you can't make a fraction of a mask and you need to have enough material for all 8 masks).
- Since each set requires 2.25 yards of material, 3 sets will require 3 * 2.25 = 6.75 yards of material.

Now, we add the material needed for the small and large masks together:
- 10 yards (for small masks) + 6.75 yards (for large masks) = 16.75 yards of material.

Therefore, Jo would need 16.75 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks.

2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the hours spent on these activities:
10 (sleep) + 8 (work) + 1 (walking the dog) = 19 hours.

There are 24 hours in a day, so the free time Harold has left is:
24 - 19 = 5 hours.

"Tim originally has 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes.

He uses 3 blue shoe boxes, so the number of blue shoe boxes left is:
7 - 3 = 4 blue shoe boxes

He uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes, so the number of red shoe boxes used is:
1/3 * 9 = 3 red shoe boxes

The number of red shoe boxes left is:
9 - 3 = 6 red shoe boxes

The total number of shoe boxes left is the sum of the blue and red shoe boxes left:
4 + 6 = 10 shoe boxes

"Let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \).

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. We can write this as an equation:

\[ D - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]

We are also given that Duncan's current age \( D \) is 60. So we can substitute \( D \) with 60 in the equation:

\[ 60 - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To find the total number of acres that Farmer Brown's and Farmer Smith's farms have together, we first need to calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Since Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice that would be:

2 * 200 acres = 400 acres

Adding the additional 100 acres to this, we get:

400 acres + 100 acres = 500 acres

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:

200 acres + 500 acres = 700 acres

Therefore, the two farms together have 700 acres.

"To find out how much money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of packages Colby completes per hour.
2. Calculate the total number of packages he completes in an eight-hour workday.
3. Multiply the total number of packages by the amount he earns per package.

Step 1: Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, which is:
50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Step 2: In an eight-hour workday, the total number of packages he completes is:
40 packages/hour * 8 hours = 320 packages.

Step 3: Colby earns $0.20 for every package, so his total earnings for the day are:
320 packages * $0.20/package = $64.00.

Therefore, Colby earns $64.00 in a typical eight-hour workday.

"To solve this, we need to calculate the total time John spends on an extreme Sudoku puzzle and then determine how many bottles of water he drinks during that time.

A normal Sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes, and an extreme Sudoku takes 4 times that long. So, the time for an extreme Sudoku is:

45 minutes * 4 = 180 minutes

John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, which is every 30 minutes. To find out how many bottles he drinks in 180 minutes, we divide the total time by the interval at which he drinks:

180 minutes / 30 minutes per bottle = 6 bottles

So, John drinks 6 bottles of water during the time it takes him to complete an extreme Sudoku puzzle.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( r \) as the number of red balloons,
- \( y \) as the number of yellow balloons.

From the problem, we know that:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon,
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon,
- Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna,
- There are 20 red balloons.

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown can be represented by the equation:
\[ 2r + 3y = 58 \]

Since we know \( r = 20 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[ 2(20) + 3y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3y = 58 \]

Now, we solve for \( y \):
\[ 3y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3y = 18 \]
\[ y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ y = 6 \]

So, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

"To find out how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide that by 2, since they had the same amount of allowance.

The cost of the cake is $11.
The cost of 1 dozen (12) balloons at $0.5 for 2 balloons is \( 12 \div 2 \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = $3 \).
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each is \( 2 \times 7 = $14 \).

The total amount spent is \( 11 + 3 + 14 = $28 \).

Since this amount is the combined allowance of Julia and Nadine, we divide it by 2 to find out how much each one received:
\( 28 \div 2 = $14 \).

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"To find out how much money the class was able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops and then subtract the total cost of buying them.

First, we calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class:
30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops:
300 lollipops * $0.8/lollypop = $240

Then, we calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops:
300 lollipops * $0.5/lollypop = $150

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
$240 - $150 = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(21 \div 3 = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:

- Cats: 3

"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of cups used for cinnamon tea.
2. Subtract the number of cinnamon tea cups from the total number of cups to find out how many cups are left for chamomile and mint tea.
3. Divide the remaining cups equally between chamomile and mint tea.
4. Since the remaining cups are divided into 3 rows, we will then divide the number of mint tea cups by 3 to find out how many are in each row.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total cups of cinnamon tea: 15 cups
2. Total cups of tea: 27 cups
3. Remaining cups for chamomile and mint tea: 27 cups - 15 cups = 12 cups
4. Since the remaining cups are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea, we have: 12 cups / 2 = 6 cups of mint tea
5. The 6 cups of mint tea are divided into 3 rows, so: 6 cups / 3 rows = 2 cups of mint tea per row

The number of cups of mint tea in each row is 2.

"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to calculate how many trips he can make in that time.

Since it takes the sloth 4 hours to make one trip (down, pick berries, and back up), in 8 hours, he can make:

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

To collect 24 berries in 2 trips, he must pick up:

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip to meet his goal is 12.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial amount of water in the tank, which is half the amount of water in the pool.
2. Calculate the total amount of water used after 6 days by multiplying the daily usage rate by the number of days.
3. Subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find the remaining amount.

Let's do the calculations:

1. The pool has 10,000 gallons of water, so the tank is filled with half of that:
   \( \text{Water in the tank} = \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ gallons} \)

2. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so after 6 days:
   \( \text{Water used} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3,000 \text{ gallons} \)

3. The remaining amount of water in the tank after 6 days is:
   \( \text{Remaining water} = 5,000 \text{ gallons} - 3,000 \text{ gallons} = 2,000 \text{ gallons} \)

"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his total expenses for the month and subtract that from the $150 he was given.

First, let's calculate the cost of the movies he has already seen:
- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays at $10 each: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days at $7 each: 8 * $7 = $56

Next, let's calculate the cost of the popcorn and candy he has already bought:
- 2 tubs of popcorn at $8 each: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy at $2 each: 4 * $2 = $8

Now, let's add up all his expenses so far:
- Movies: $50 + $56 = $106
- Snacks: $16 + $8 = $24
- Total expenses: $106 + $24 = $130

Colby has $150 to spend, so let's see how much he has left:
- Remaining budget: $150 - $130 = $20

On the last day of the month, which is a Friday, he wants to see a movie, get a popcorn, and a box of candy. The cost for this will be:
- Movie ticket on Friday: $10
- Popcorn: $8
- Box of candy: $2
- Total for the night: $10 + $8 + $2 = $20

Since the cost for the night is exactly $20, which is the amount he has left, he can see 1 more movie.

"To find the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal one, so it has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.
- Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories for the mini cinnamon rolls are 200 rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories.

Next, we calculate the calories for the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal one, so it has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.
- Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories for the mini blueberry muffins are 300 muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories.

Finally, we add the calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins to get the total calories:
- Total calories = 40,000 calories (from mini cinnamon rolls) + 45,000 calories (from mini blueberry muffins) = 85,000 calories.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days and then divide by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, which is 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as Monday, which is again 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add up the total number of Junebugs removed:
39 (Monday) + 78 (Tuesday) + 78 (Wednesday) + 48 (Thursday) + 57 (Friday) = 300 Junebugs.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of days (5):

"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then subtract the car's distance from the bus's distance.

The formula to calculate distance is:
Distance = Speed × Time

For the bus:
Distance_bus = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
Distance_car = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, we subtract the car's distance from the bus's distance to find out how much farther the bus went:
Distance_bus - Distance_car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

The number of stuffed animals is 8.
The number of stacking rings is 9.

Let's add these numbers together:

31 (building blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, we subtract the total number of toys Sophie had before the bouncy balls from the new total:

62 (total toys after buying bouncy balls) - 48 (total toys before buying bouncy balls) = 14

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as P, Pa, and J, respectively.

According to the problem, we have the following equations:

1. P + Pa + J = 100 (The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old)
2. Pa = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than Jean, not John, but I will assume it's a typo and should be Jean)
3. P = Pa + J (Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age)

From equation 2, we can express Pa in terms of J:

Pa = J + 10

Now, we can substitute Pa in equation 3 with J + 10:

P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now we have P in terms of J. We can substitute P and Pa in equation 1 with their expressions in terms of J:

(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
4J + 20 = 100
4J = 80
J = 20

Now that we have Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:

Pa = J + 10
Pa = 20 + 10
Pa = 30

And finally, we can find Peter's age:

P = Pa + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

So, Peter is 50 years old.

"To find the total number of water balloons the girls had, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. First, we calculate the number of water balloons Maria gave to her friends. Since she has 4 friends and gave each 2 water balloons, that's 4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons.

2. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.

3. Then, Maria's mom came out and gave each person (Maria and her 4 friends, so 5 people in total) 3 more balloons. That's 5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 balloons.

4. To find the total, we add the balloons Maria gave to her friends, the one Maria had for herself, and the additional balloons given by her mom.

Total balloons = (balloons given to friends) + (balloons Maria had) + (balloons given by mom)
Total balloons = 8 + 1 + 15
Total balloons = 24

Now, let's add the 10 boxes they already have:
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all 60 boxes, given that 2 boxes can fit per table:
60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

The charity group already owns 15 tables, so we need to find out how many more tables are needed:

"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total revenue generated by each machine over the course of a month and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month:

- The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour.
- The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour.

Both machines run 24 hours a day for 30 days, so the total number of hours they run in a month is:
24 hours/day * 30 days = 720 hours

Now, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month:

- Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 720 hours = 43,200 widgets
- WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 720 hours = 32,400 widgets

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the widgets:

- Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
- WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Finally, we find the difference in revenue between the two machines:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

So, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month.

5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

The total cost for Cameron's stay is:
1000 pesos (for the first 12 hours) + 350 pesos (for the additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos

If Cameron had chosen the 24-hour stay option, it would have cost him 1600 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron saves by choosing the 12-hour stay plus the additional hours is:
1600 pesos (24-hour stay) - 1350 pesos (12-hour stay + additional hours) = 250 pesos

"To find out how many pounds of hay Nate needs, we first need to calculate the amount of hay required for the goats and the sheep separately, and then add the two amounts together.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Since there are 15 goats, the total amount of hay needed for the goats is:
15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds

Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that amount is:
2 * 5 pounds = 10 pounds

So each sheep needs 3 pounds less than 10 pounds, which is:
10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds

Since there are 12 sheep, the total amount of hay needed for the sheep is:
12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

Now, we add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:
75 pounds (for goats) + 84 pounds (for sheep) = 159 pounds

Therefore, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay.

"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:

Earnings = Hourly Rate * Hours Worked
Earnings = 50 dollars/hour * 6 hours
Earnings = 300 dollars

Next, we'll subtract the amount he spends on gas and the amount he wants to deposit in the bank:

Remaining Money = Earnings - Gas - Bank Deposit
Remaining Money = 300 dollars - 50 dollars - 100 dollars
Remaining Money = 150 dollars

Now, we'll calculate the total cost of the 5 pencils:

Cost of Pencils = Number of Pencils * Cost per Pencil
Cost of Pencils = 5 * 10 dollars
Cost of Pencils = 50 dollars

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:

Money After Pencils = Remaining Money - Cost of Pencils
Money After Pencils = 150 dollars - 50 dollars
Money After Pencils = 100 dollars

Finally, we'll determine how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the money left after buying the pencils:

Number of Pens = Money After Pencils / Cost per Pen
Number of Pens = 100 dollars / 25 dollars/pen
Number of Pens = 4

So, John can buy 4 pens.

2. Labor cost: $35 per hour for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours.
3. Parts cost: $60

Now, let's calculate the labor cost for 3 hours:
Labor cost = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, we add all the costs together:
Total charge = Visit fee + Labor cost + Parts cost
Total charge = $40 + $105 + $60

Total charge = $205

"To find out how much money James was out, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs after the discount, then subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs he didn't like.

1. Calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:
   10 CDs * $15/CD = $150

2. Calculate the discount amount:
   40% of $150 = 0.40 * $150 = $60

3. Calculate the total cost of the CDs after the discount:
   $150 - $60 = $90

4. Calculate the amount he got from selling 5 CDs:
   5 CDs * $40/CD = $200

5. Since he sold the CDs for more than he paid for all of them, he actually made a profit. However, the question asks how much money he was out, which in this case is negative (he gained money). To find out how much he was out, we subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs from the total cost after the discount:
   $90 - $200 = -$110

Since the question asks for the amount he was out, and he actually gained money, the answer is that he was out $0 (or he gained $110, but the question specifically asks for the amount he was out).

"To calculate Jen's total earnings from selling her root crops, we need to multiply the number of each type of crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

For the yams:
6 yams * $1.5/yam = $9.0

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2/sweet potato = $20.0

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25/carrot = $5.0

Now, we add up the earnings from each type of crop to get the total earnings:
$9.0 + $20.0 + $5.0 = $34.0

Jen will earn $34.0 if she sells everything.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time for each part of James's journey.

1. **Swimming the first part:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - 60% of 20 miles is 0.60 * 20 = 12 miles.
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - The time to swim 12 miles is 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

2. **Resting on the island:**
   - James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   - The rest time is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

3. **Swimming the remaining part:**
   - The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.
   - James swims the remaining distance at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.
   - The time to swim 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

4. **Total time:**
   - The total time is the sum of the time spent swimming the first part, resting, and swimming the remaining part.
   - Total time = 6 hours (first part) + 3 hours (rest) + 8 hours (remaining part) = 17 hours.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we can set up the equation based on the information given:

Let \( S \) represent the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. According to the problem, \( S = 70 \).

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had. So, the number of loaves the bakery has can be represented as:

\( 7 \times S - 40 \)

Substituting \( S \) with 70, we get:

\( 7 \times 70 - 40 \)

Now, we calculate the result:

\( 490 - 40 = 450 \)

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

"To calculate the total commission Cayley earns, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper separately and then add them together.

For the New York Times:
- Each copy costs $5.
- The commission is 10% of $5, which is 0.10 * $5 = $0.50 per copy.
- For 6 copies, the total commission is 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Each copy costs $15.
- The commission is 8% of $15, which is 0.08 * $15 = $1.20 per copy.
- For 10 copies, the total commission is 10 * $1.20 = $12.00.

Adding the commissions from both newspapers:
- Total commission = $3.00 (New York Times) + $12.00 (Wall Street Journal) = $15.00.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find Leo's age, we first need to determine Marcus's age. We know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, who is 26 years old.

So, Marcus's age is:
26 - 5 = 21 years old

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. Therefore, to find Leo's age, we multiply Marcus's age by 2:

21 * 2 = 42 years old

Leo is 42 years old.

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati as B, by Azibo as A, and by Dinar as D. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. B + A + D = 45 (the total points scored by the team)
2. B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
3. B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

From the second equation, we can express A in terms of B:
A = B - 20

From the third equation, we can express D in terms of B:
D = B - 10

Now we can substitute A and D in the first equation with the expressions in terms of B:
B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45

Combine like terms:
3B - 30 = 45

Add 30 to both sides:
3B = 75

Divide by 3:
B = 25

Now that we know B, we can find A:
A = B - 20
A = 25 - 20
A = 5

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To find out how many reports Vince can staple from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, we need to calculate the total time he spent stapling and then determine how many reports he can staple in that time.

First, let's calculate the total time in minutes:
- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.
- 15 hours is equal to 15 * 60 minutes, which is 900 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
- 900 minutes / 15 minutes per interval = 60 intervals.

Since Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can now calculate the total number of reports:
- 60 intervals * 30 reports per interval = 1800 reports.

Therefore, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether.

"Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours or 480 minutes. On the day she sleepwalked, she was out of bed from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes. She also woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so instead of waking up at 6 a.m., she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

To calculate the total sleep time, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the extra 5 minutes she was awake from her usual sleep time.

480 minutes (usual sleep time) - 23 minutes (sleepwalking) - 5 minutes (woke up early) = 452 minutes.

"Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. If he has two dozen cups, that means he has 24 measuring cups (since one dozen equals 12).

To find out how many measuring spoons he has, we calculate 2/3 of 24:

\[ \text{Measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

So, Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons.

If he gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ \text{Measuring spoons remaining} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the number of measuring cups to the number of measuring spoons remaining:

\[ \text{Total utensils remaining} = \text{Measuring cups} + \text{Measuring spoons remaining} \]
\[ \text{Total utensils remaining} = 24 + 10 = 34 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial number of occupied beds.
2. Calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks.
3. Calculate the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks.
4. Subtract the total number of occupied beds from the hospital's capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds.

Step 1: Initial number of occupied beds
The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of them are occupied.
Initial occupied beds = 1000 * (1/5) = 200 beds

Step 2: Number of patients admitted over 2 weeks
There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 14 days.
Patients admitted each day = 50
Total patients admitted over 2 weeks = 50 * 14 = 700 patients

Step 3: Total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks
Total occupied beds = Initial occupied beds + Patients admitted over 2 weeks
Total occupied beds = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

Step 4: Number of unoccupied beds
Unoccupied beds = Hospital capacity - Total occupied beds
Unoccupied beds = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds

   16 - 7 = 9 non-work emails

2. Calculate the number of emails to family:
   Two-thirds of the non-work emails are to family.
   (2/3) * 9 = 6 emails to family

3. Calculate the remaining emails after work and family emails:
   Non-work emails - Emails to family = Remaining emails
   9 - 6 = 3 remaining emails

4. Calculate the number of emails to her boyfriend:
   One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend.
   (1/3) * 3 = 1 email to her boyfriend

"To find out how old Shawna's father is, we need to first determine Shawna's age based on Aliya's age.

Given that Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years old

Now that we know Shawna is 9 years old, we can find out how old Shawna's father is. Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna:

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years old

So, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

"If Courtney reported that the audience was 48 in number but overstated this number by 20%, we can find the actual number of people who attended the concert by calculating what 100% (the actual number) would be.

Let's denote the actual number of people as \( x \). According to the information, Courtney's count of 48 is 120% of the actual number, because she overstated by 20%.

So we can write the equation as:
\[ 1.20 \times x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Now we calculate the value of \( x \):
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

The total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to first determine the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day and then use the information that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day.

Let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:

- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes, so the net holes dug on the third day is 8 - 2 = 6 holes

Total holes by the end of the third day:
10 (first day) + 13 (second day) + 6 (third day) = 29 holes

Now, we know that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes, so four times that is:

4 * 10 = 40 holes

Since there were 29 holes by the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day and the total number of holes by the end of the third day:

40 (total by the end of the fourth day) - 29 (total by the end of the third day) = 11 holes

So, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

"If Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, and the third person (Collins) got 15 more than either of them, then Collins got:

70 corn chips + 15 corn chips = 85 corn chips

To find the total number of corn chips, we add the amounts that each person got:

70 corn chips (Amora) + 70 corn chips (Lainey) + 85 corn chips (Collins) = 225 corn chips

So, the total number of corn chips altogether is:

"To find out how much the travel costs, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of the supplies.

The cost of the supplies is $400. To find 50% of this amount, we multiply $400 by 50% (or 0.5):

$400 * 0.5 = $200

This is the additional cost for the tickets. To find the total cost of the tickets, we add this additional cost to the original cost of the supplies:

$400 (cost of supplies) + $200 (additional cost) = $600

So, the travel costs $600.

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

According to the problem, we have the following equations:

1. \( X + S + A = 339 \) (the total number of Pokemon caught)
2. \( X = S + 5 \) (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \) (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to express everything in terms of \( S \) and \( A \):

\( (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \)

Simplifying, we get:

\( 2S + A + 5 = 339 \)

\( 2S + A = 334 \) (Equation 4)

Now, we can substitute the third equation into Equation 4:

\( 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \)

Expanding and simplifying:

\( 8A - 26 + A = 334 \)

\( 9A - 26 = 334 \)

\( 9A = 360 \)

\( A = 40 \) (Adelwolfe's Pokemon count)

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( S \) using the third equation:

\( S = 4A - 13 \)

\( S = 4(40) - 13 \)

\( S = 160 - 13 \)

\( S = 147 \) (Stan's Pokemon count)

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to determine the total number of episodes and then multiply that by the length of each episode.

We know that each episode is 20 minutes long and that there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. This means that the number of episodes is 20 / 2, which is 10 episodes.

Now, to find the total time spent watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

10 episodes * 20 minutes/episode = 200 minutes

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode.

"To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance the bird traveled in each direction and then sum the distances traveled to the south, subtracting the distance traveled to the north.

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
   Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 10 hours = 300 miles

2. The bird then flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
   Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 2 hours = 36 miles

3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
   Distance = Speed × Time = 22 mph × 5 hours = 110 miles

Now, we add the distances traveled to the south and subtract the distance traveled to the north to find the total distance between the two homes:

Total distance to the south = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles
Total distance to the north = 36 miles

Net distance between the homes = Total distance to the south - Total distance to the north
Net distance between the homes = 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles

"To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she had and then subtract the number of brownies that were eaten.

1. Greta made a batch of 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself.
2. She was sent home with 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office party.
3. Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies for the surprise party.
4. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.

First, we convert all the dozens to individual brownies:
- 1 dozen = 12 brownies
- 1/2 dozen = 6 brownies
- 4 dozen = 48 brownies
- 1 1/2 dozen = 18 brownies

Now, we add up all the brownies she had:
- 12 (from herself) + 6 (from the office) + 48 (from the surprise party) = 66 brownies

Then, we subtract the brownies that were eaten:
- 66 (total brownies) - 18 (eaten) = 48 brownies

So, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.

- The fourth phone (for the other kid) is also half price, so it costs $600 / 2 = $300.

Now, we add up the costs:

$600 (first phone) + $600 (second phone) + $300 (third phone) + $300 (fourth phone) = $1800

So, John paid a total of $1800 for all the phones.

"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we first need to determine how many players are on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

Number of players on Zeke's team = Number of players on Carlton's team + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Carlton's team to the number of players on Zeke's team:

Total number of players = Number of players on Carlton's team + Number of players on Zeke's team
Total number of players = 13 + 20
Total number of players = 33

"To find out how many wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:

P = 2 * (length + width)

Given that the length (L) is 15 feet and the width (W) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2 * (15 + 10)
P = 2 * 25
P = 50 feet

Now, since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the total perimeter by 2 to find the total number of slats needed:

Total slats needed = Perimeter * Slats per foot
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

"To find out how much Sunny earned over the two days, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold each day and then multiply by the cost of each item.

Let's start with the gingerbread:
- On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.
- On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.

Now, let's calculate the apple pie:
- On Sunday, Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie.
- On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday, so he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

Next, we calculate the earnings for each item:
- Gingerbread earnings: (10 + 15) boxes * $6/box = 25 * $6 = $150
- Apple pie earnings: (11 + 15) boxes * $15/box = 26 * $15 = $390

5. To find out the current age of Emil's dad, we subtract 5 years from his age when Emil is 24, so his dad is 48 - 5 = 43 years old now.
6. To find out the current age of Emil's brother, we also subtract 5 years from his age when Emil is 24, so his brother is 12 - 5 = 7 years old now.
7. The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 43 + 7 = 50.

"To find out how many beads Adrianne has altogether, we need to add up the beads she received from her mother, her sister, and her friend.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which is 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, which is 20 * 2 = 40 beads.

Now, we add all the beads together:

20 (from mother) + 30 (from sister) + 40 (from friend) = 90 beads.

So, Adrianne has 90 beads altogether.

"To find out how many servings of crawfish Joe has, we need to calculate the total amount of crawfish he caught over the three days and then divide that by the amount that constitutes one serving.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

The total amount of crawfish Joe caught is:
3 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) + 6 (Saturday) = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, the number of servings Joe has is:
21 pounds / 3 pounds per serving = 7 servings.

"To find out how many students are leaving early, we need to calculate the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members, and then add these two numbers together.

First, we calculate the number of football players:
20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

Next, we find out how many students are left after the football players leave:
30 students - 6 football players = 24 students

Then, we calculate the number of cheerleaders or band members from the remaining students:
25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early:
6 football players + 6 cheerleaders or band members = 12 students

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is:
12"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine the size of Charlie's boots.

If Sophie wears size 5 boots, and Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, then Charlie's boots are:

5 (Sophie's size) * 5 = 25

Now, to find the average size of the shoes worn by the two, we add the sizes of their boots and divide by 2:

(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15.

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the width of the flowers from inches to feet.
2. Calculate the total space each plant, including the space between them, will occupy.
3. Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed.
4. Subtract the number of plants Pat already owns from the total number of plants needed.
5. Calculate the cost of the additional plants needed.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. Each flower grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot (since 12 inches = 1 foot).
2. Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between them, so the total space each plant will occupy is 1 foot (the plant itself) + 1.5 feet (the space between plants) = 2.5 feet.
3. The total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed is the length of the flower bed divided by the space each plant occupies: 111 feet / 2.5 feet per plant = 44.4. Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.
4. Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs 44 - 17 = 27 more plants.
5. Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for 27 plants is 27 * $6 = $162.

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

"Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar does each day. So, if Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, his brother eats:

18 pretzels/day * 1/2 = 9 pretzels/day

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by the number of days in a week:

9 pretzels/day * 7 days/week = 63 pretzels/week

"To find out how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of the plants for one basket and then multiply that by the number of baskets.

For one basket, the cost of the petunias is:
3 petunias * $3.00 per petunia = $9.00

The cost of the sweet potato vines for one basket is:
2 sweet potato vines * $2.50 per vine = $5.00

The total cost for one basket is:
$9.00 (petunias) + $5.00 (sweet potato vines) = $14.00

Now, to find the total cost for all 5 baskets, we multiply the cost of one basket by the number of baskets:
$14.00 per basket * 5 baskets = $70.00

So, the total amount Katherine will spend is:
$70.00"
"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations, and then see how much soil is left for the roses.

First, let's calculate the soil used for the sunflowers:
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

Next, the soil used for the carnations:
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, let's add the soil used for sunflowers and carnations:
12 pounds (sunflowers) + 15 pounds (carnations) = 27 pounds

The total amount of soil they started with is 30 pounds, so the remaining soil for the roses is:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"Jessica sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck, which is:

$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00

She saves this amount each month, so in a year (12 months), she will have saved:

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of pairs she can buy with her savings is:

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

"To find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to calculate the time for each task separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp:
Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To peel 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the number of shrimp she can peel per minute:
90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to saute 90 shrimp:
Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find out how long it takes to saute 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the number of shrimp she can saute in one batch and then multiply by the time it takes to saute one batch:
(90 shrimp / 30 shrimp per batch) * 10 minutes per batch = 3 batches * 10 minutes per batch = 30 minutes

Now, we add the time for peeling and the time for sauteing to get the total time:
15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (sauteing) = 45 minutes

So, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature change for each period the air conditioner was running and when it was off.

1. On low for 3 hours: The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees per hour, so over 3 hours it will cool the room by 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.
2. On high for 4 hours: The air conditioner cools the room 3 degrees per hour, so over 4 hours it will cool the room by 3 * 4 = 12 degrees.
3. Off for 2 hours: The room will warm up 2 degrees per hour, so over 2 hours it will warm up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

Now, we can calculate the total temperature change by adding the cooling and subtracting the warming:

Total cooling = 6 degrees (low) + 12 degrees (high) = 18 degrees
Total warming = 4 degrees

Net temperature change = Total cooling - Total warming = 18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Bill's dad saw Comet Halley when he was 30 years old.
2. Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the next time the comet would be visible would be 75 years after the dad saw it.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. So, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet the second time.
4. Since the comet appears every 75 years, and Bill saw it when he was 90, the first time he saw the comet would have been 75 years earlier, when he was 90 - 75 = 15 years old.

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.

"To calculate the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to add up the checks for each category:

- Electric bill: 1 check per month × 12 months = 12 checks per year
- Gas bill: 1 check per month × 12 months = 12 checks per year
- Church: 2 checks per month × 12 months = 24 checks per year
- Pest and lawn service: 1 check per quarter × 4 quarters = 4 checks per year

Now, we add them all up:

12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks per year

"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \).

According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which means \( \frac{3}{4}F \) flights are to Greece. The remaining flights, which are \( \frac{1}{4}F \), are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{8}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes is twice the number of flights the second plane makes:

\[ F = 2 \times 44 \]
\[ F = 88 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France:

\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8}F \]
\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 \]
\[ \text{Flights to France} = 11 \]

So, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum them up.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add up the durations of their howls:
20 (Tobias) + 40 (Chikote) + 60 (Igneous) = 120 seconds.

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert the total seconds to minutes:
120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.

"Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar's age = 3 years
- Alessandro's age = 4 years
- Helene's age = H years
- Wilfred's age = W years

The total age of the children is given as 20 years, so we can write the equation:

3 + 4 + H + W = 20

Simplifying, we get:

H + W = 20 - 3 - 4
H + W = 13

We are also told that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So the average age is 20 / 4 = 5 years. Therefore, Helene's age is twice this average:

H = 2 * 5
H = 10

Now we can substitute Helene's age back into the equation for the total age:

10 + W = 13

Solving for W, we get:

W = 13 - 10
W = 3

So, Wilfred is 3 years old.

"To find out how many people were in the church next door, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests.
2. Determine how many cookies were given to the church.
3. Calculate how many people in the church received 15 cookies each.

Step 1: Total number of cookies brought by the guests
There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies.
Total cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

Step 2: Number of cookies given to the church
The bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church.
Cookies given to the church = 1/2 * 1500 cookies = 750 cookies

Step 3: Number of people in the church who received 15 cookies each
Each person in the church received 15 cookies.
Number of people = 750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

So, 50 people were in the church next door.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a ratio to represent the distribution of the watermelon slices. Let's say each kid's slice is of size \( x \). Then, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

There are 4 kids and 2 adults, so the total number of slices in terms of \( x \) is:
\[ 4x + 2(2x) = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the entire watermelon is divided into 8 parts of size \( x \).

Each adult gets \( 2x \), which is \( 2 \) parts out of the \( 8 \) total parts. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we calculate:
\[ \frac{2x}{8x} \times 100\% = \frac{2}{8} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he will spend on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from his total available time at the clinic.

First, let's calculate the time spent on rounds:
- Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients.
- Each inpatient check takes 20 minutes.
- Total time for rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on appointments:
- Doctor Jones has 10 appointments.
- Each appointment takes 30 minutes.
- Total time for appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.

Now, let's convert the total time for rounds and appointments into hours:
- Total time for rounds in hours = 180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours.
- Total time for appointments in hours = 300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours.

Now, let's add the time spent on rounds and appointments to find the total time spent:
- Total time spent = 3 hours (rounds) + 5 hours (appointments) = 8 hours.

Finally, let's subtract the total time spent from the total available time to find the time left for updating records:
- Time left for updating records = 9 hours (total available) - 8 hours (spent) = 1 hour.

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up all the time required for each step and then subtract that total from the time she wants to serve the cake.

The total time required is:
- 20 minutes to make the cake batter
- 30 minutes to bake the cake
- 2 hours to cool the cake
- 10 minutes to frost the cake

Let's convert all the times to minutes for easier calculation:
- 20 minutes (batter)
- 30 minutes (baking)
- 2 hours = 120 minutes (cooling)
- 10 minutes (frosting)

Now, let's add up the total time in minutes:
20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours.

Jordan wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm. To find the latest time she can start, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as \( x \).

Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold \( 64 \) chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:

\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by \( 8 \):

\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]

\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the following:

1. The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
2. The cost per student per session is $1.50.
3. There are 10 students.
4. The studio is rented 3 days a week.

First, we calculate the total cost per session:
- Studio rental cost per session: $25
- Cost per student per session: $1.50 * 10 students = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40

Next, we calculate the total cost per week:
- Total cost per session * 3 sessions per week = $40 * 3 = $120

Now, we need to determine the number of weeks in a month. For simplicity, we'll assume an average month has about 4 weeks.

Finally, we calculate the total cost per month:
- Total cost per week * 4 weeks = $120 * 4 = $480

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month would be the total cost, which is the amount the studio would need to cover. However, if you are asking for the revenue (which is the income before expenses), we need to calculate the income from the students.

Revenue per session from students:
- $1.50 * 10 students = $15

Total revenue per week:
- $15 * 3 sessions = $45

Total revenue per month:
- $45 * 4 weeks = $180

So, the expected earnings (revenue) of the dance studio in a month from the students would be $180. However, this does not cover the studio rental costs, which would need to be subtracted to find the profit.

If the question is asking for the total amount the studio would need to cover (costs), the answer is $480. If it's asking for the revenue from students, the answer is $180. If it's asking for the profit, it would be a negative number since the costs exceed the revenue.

Since the question asks for the expected earnings, I will provide the revenue from students as the answer:

"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we need to first determine how many chocolate bars are in each of their boxes.

Let's start with Peter. If Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars, we can find the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:

Number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes = Total chocolate bars / Number of boxes
Number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes = 64 / 4
Number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes = 16

Now, let's do the same for Martha. If Martha has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars, we can find the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:

Number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes = Total chocolate bars / Number of boxes
Number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes = 56 / 7
Number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes = 8

Now we can find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha by subtracting the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes:

More chocolate bars in Peter's boxes = Number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes - Number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes
More chocolate bars in Peter's boxes = 16 - 8
More chocolate bars in Peter's boxes = 8

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

2. Determine the number of babies born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of babies born in a year.
4. Add the total number of babies born in a year to the initial population to get the final population.

Step 1: Number of female porcupines
The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population.
Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Step 2: Number of babies born each month
Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
Babies born each month = 30 * 4 = 120

Step 3: Total number of babies born in a year
There are 12 months in a year.
Total babies born in a year = 120 * 12 = 1440

Step 4: Final population after a year
Initial population = 50
Final population = Initial population + Total babies born in a year
Final population = 50 + 1440 = 1490

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.
2. Convert the volume to gallons using the given conversion factor.
3. Calculate the cost to fill the pool based on the price per gallon.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.
The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 25 \, \text{ft} \times 14 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.
The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons.
\[ \text{Gallons} = V \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \]

Step 3: Calculate the cost to fill the pool.
The cost is $0.10 per gallon.
\[ \text{Cost} = \text{Gallons} \times 0.10 \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \]

The cost to fill the pool will be $826.

"To find the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we need to break down the student population by age and gender.

First, we'll determine the number of students over 16 years old and the number of students under 16 years old:
- Students over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students
- Students under 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students

Next, we'll find out how many of the students over 16 years old are male and how many are female:
- Male students over 16 years old: 1500 / 4 = 375 students
- Female students over 16 years old: 1500 - 375 = 1125 students

Then, we'll determine the number of male and female students under 16 years old:
- Male students under 16 years old: 1500 / 2 = 750 students
- Female students under 16 years old: 1500 - 750 = 750 students

Finally, we'll add the number of female students over 16 years old to the number of female students under 16 years old to get the total number of female students:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps in one hour.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps in one hour.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps in one hour.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

10 (Bethany's laps) - 5 (Quinn's laps) = 5

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn.

- Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day:
  \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons

Now, let's add up all the water pumped into the tank over the two days:

- Total water pumped by Wanda:
  \( 4500 + 3000 = 7500 \) gallons

- Total water pumped by Ms. B:
  \( 3375 + 1125 = 4500 \) gallons

- Total water pumped into the tank:
  \( 7500 + 4500 = 12000 \) gallons

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity to find out how much water is remaining:

- Water remaining to fill the tank:
  \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons

"To find out the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

First, we need to account for the 3 hours where the power bank was losing 7% of its total capacity each hour. If the power bank is losing 7% per hour, then each hour it retains 93% (100% - 7%) of its charge from the previous hour. We can reverse this process by dividing the final charge by 0.93 for each of the 3 hours.

Let's calculate the charge before the 7% loss per hour for 3 hours:

Charge after 5 hours of 9% loss = 28%
Charge before 3 hours of 7% loss = 28% / 0.93 / 0.93 / 0.93

Now, we need to account for the 5 hours where the power bank was losing 9% of its total capacity each hour. Similarly, if the power bank is losing 9% per hour, then each hour it retains 91% (100% - 9%) of its charge from the previous hour. We can reverse this process by dividing the charge by 0.91 for each of the 5 hours.

Let's calculate the initial charge before the 9% loss per hour for 5 hours:

Initial charge = (28% / 0.93 / 0.93 / 0.93) / 0.91 / 0.91 / 0.91 / 0.91 / 0.91

Now, let's do the math:

Charge before 3 hours of 7% loss = 28% / 0.93^3
Charge before 5 hours of 9% loss = (28% / 0.93^3) / 0.91^5

Let's calculate the values:

Charge before 3 hours of 7% loss = 28% / (0.93 * 0.93 * 0.93) ≈ 28% / 0.804357 ≈ 34.80%
Charge before 5 hours of 9% loss = 34.80% / (0.91 * 0.91 * 0.91 * 0.91 * 0.91) ≈ 34.80% / 0.6240321 ≈ 55.77%

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 55.77%.

"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to save, which is 20% of $10,000.

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Next, we need to determine how much Janet earns in a week. She makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, which totals to $25 an hour.

$10 (wages) + $15 (tips) = $25 per hour

If she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

$25 per hour * 40 hours = $1,000 per week

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for her to save $2,000, which is the amount needed for the down payment.

$2,000 (total needed) / $1,000 (weekly earnings) = 2 weeks

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save up the down payment for the car.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: 3 * $0.50 = $1.50
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: 4 * $0.50 = $2.00
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up these costs to find the total amount spent so far:

Total spent = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:

Remaining money = $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining money is:

Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

"To find out how many guests the hotel now has, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform the necessary calculations.

1. The hotel started with 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so we subtract 24 from 100:
   100 - 24 = 76 guests remaining.
3. 15 guests checked out late, so we subtract 15 from the remaining 76:
   76 - 15 = 61 guests remaining.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice that number checked in:
   2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in.
5. We add the 30 guests who checked in to the 61 guests remaining:
   61 + 30 = 91 guests.
6. After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so we add 7 to the 91 guests:
   91 + 7 = 98 guests.

The hotel now has 98 guests.

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( L = 3S \) and \( S = $4 \).

Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals sold as \( x \) and the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( y \). The problem states that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so \( x = 2y \).

The total earnings from the sales are given as $120, which is the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals. Therefore, we can write the equation for total earnings as:

\[ 4x + 3(4)y = 120 \]

Since \( x = 2y \), we can substitute \( 2y \) for \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 4(2y) + 3(4)y = 120 \]
\[ 8y + 12y = 120 \]
\[ 20y = 120 \]
\[ y = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ y = 6 \]

Now that we know \( y \), the number of large stuffed animals sold, we can find \( x \), the number of small stuffed animals sold:

\[ x = 2y \]
\[ x = 2(6) \]
\[ x = 12 \]

So, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the daily consumption for each family member and then multiply by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, so in one week he eats:
5 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 35 sandwiches/week

The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, so in one week she eats:
4 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 28 sandwiches/week

The son eats 2 sandwiches per day, so in one week he eats:
2 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 14 sandwiches/week

Now, we add up the weekly consumption for all three family members:
35 sandwiches/week (man) + 28 sandwiches/week (wife) + 14 sandwiches/week (son) = 77 sandwiches/week

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in a day, and then multiply that by the number of dwarves and the number of days in the month.

1. First, we find out how much ore a dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe:
   - A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so:
     12 pounds * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day.

2. Next, we calculate how much ore a dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe:
   - A steel pickaxe allows a dwarf to mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so:
     24 pounds * 1.5 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

3. Now, we find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine with steel pickaxes in one day:
   - 40 dwarves * 36 pounds = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

4. Finally, we calculate the total amount of ore mined in a month with 30 days:
   - 1440 pounds/day * 30 days = 43200 pounds of ore.

"To find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can use the information that the prices are proportional. This means that the cost per sandwich is the same for all package sizes.

First, we calculate the cost per sandwich for the first two packages:

- For the first package, the cost per sandwich is $3 / 2 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich.
- For the second package, the cost per sandwich is $6 / 4 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich.

Since the cost per sandwich is the same for both packages, we can use this cost to find the price of the third package with 8 sandwiches:

- The cost for 8 sandwiches would be 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12.

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sally starts with 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons.
2. 40% of the red balloons burst, so she loses 40% of 25, which is 10 red balloons. She now has 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.
3. She accidentally releases half of the yellow balloons, so she loses 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. She now has 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.
4. She finds 8 blue balloons and adds 75% of them to her clutch. 75% of 8 is 6, so she adds 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's add up the remaining balloons:

- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7 (none were lost or added)
- Yellow balloons: 6

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios where he would not have to turn it in and then subtract that from 100%.

1. There's a 50% chance that Marcus will have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework.
2. If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. This means there's a 50% * 40% = 20% chance that the normal teacher will give an extension.
3. If the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension (50% * 60% = 30% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. This means there's a 30% * 20% = 6% chance that Marcus will get a personal extension.

Now, we add up all the probabilities where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
- 50% (substitute teacher)
- 20% (normal teacher gives an extension)
- 6% (Marcus gets a personal extension)

The total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework is 50% + 20% + 6% = 76%.

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is 100% - 76% = 24%.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats available for friends and family by subtracting the seats for graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.
2. Divide the number of seats available for friends and family by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.

Let's do the math:

Total seats in the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300

Seats available for friends and family = Total seats - Seats for graduates - Seats for faculty
Seats available for friends and family = 6000 - 950 - 300
Seats available for friends and family = 4750

Now, we divide the seats available for friends and family by the number of graduates:

Tickets per graduate = Seats available for friends and family / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

Each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

Total earnings for 3 days = $15 * 3 = $45

Next, let's calculate her total expenses:
Parking cost per day = $3
Total parking cost for 3 days = $3 * 3 = $9

Now, we subtract the total expenses from the total earnings to find the net earnings:
Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = $45 - $9 = $36

Finally, we divide the net earnings by the total number of hours spent on jury duty to find the pay per hour:
Total hours spent = 6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours
Pay per hour after expenses = Net earnings / Total hours spent
Pay per hour after expenses = $36 / 18 hours = $2

First, we calculate the number of soda bottles:

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of bottles is:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

However, since he starts at the first bottle, he will only need to move between the bottles, which means he will move 7 times (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on until the 7th to the 8th).

"To find out how much fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he will be using. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet, and Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of the fabric piece will be:
6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of the fabric piece will be:
8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we can calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
8 feet (length) * 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. On the first race, he lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 on the first race, twice that amount is $10, and $1 more than that is $11. So, he won $11 on the second race.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 on the second race, 1.5 times that amount is $16.5. So, he lost $16.5 on the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost and the average loss per race.

Total amount lost = Amount lost in the first race + Amount lost in the third race
Total amount lost = $5 + $16.5
Total amount lost = $21.5

Since he won $11 on the second race, we need to subtract that from the total amount lost to get the net loss for the day.
Net loss for the day = Total amount lost - Amount won in the second race
Net loss for the day = $21.5 - $11
Net loss for the day = $10.5

Now, to find the average loss per race, we divide the net loss by the number of races.
Average loss per race = Net loss for the day / Number of races
Average loss per race = $10.5 / 3
Average loss per race = $3.5

So, Johnny's dad lost an average of $3.5 per race that day.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x = 1920 - 240 \]
\[ 4x = 1680 \]
\[ x = \frac{1680}{4} \]
\[ x = 420 \]

The share of the first person is $420.

"To find out how many hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Determine the fraction of a day they worked each day.
3. Convert the fraction of a day to hours.
4. Multiply the total number of days by the number of hours worked each day to get the total hours worked by the team.
5. Divide the total hours worked by the team by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Total number of days worked: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.
2. Fraction of a day worked each day: 3/8.
3. Convert the fraction of a day to hours: 3/8 * 24 hours/day = 9 hours/day.
4. Total hours worked by the team: 21 days * 9 hours/day = 189 hours.
5. Hours worked by each painter: 189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours.

Each painter put in 47.25 hours of work.

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem, in the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls, and in the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 2x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 - 4 \]

\[ 2x + \frac{x}{2} = 15 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first need to combine the terms on the left side of the equation. To do this, we can find a common denominator, which is 2:

\[ \frac{4x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} = 15 \]

\[ \frac{5x}{2} = 15 \]

Now, we can solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides by 2 and then dividing by 5:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x \), the number of balls retrieved in the second set, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set, which is \( x + 4 \):

\[ 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set of the match.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we can use the formula for exponential decay, which is:

Final Value = Initial Value * (1 - rate of depreciation) ^ number of years

In this case, the initial value is $20,000, the rate of depreciation is 21% or 0.21, and the number of years from 2007 to 2010 is 3.

Final Value = $20,000 * (1 - 0.21) ^ 3
Final Value = $20,000 * (0.79) ^ 3
Final Value = $20,000 * 0.493039
Final Value = $9,860.78

Rounded to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is $9,860.78.

"To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to calculate the total amount of food the cats consume in one day and then divide the total amount of food Imma has by the daily consumption.

First, we calculate the daily consumption:
- Each feeding is 60 grams per cat.
- There are 2 feedings per day.
- Imma has 3 cats.

So, the daily consumption is:
60 grams/feeding/cat * 2 feedings/day * 3 cats = 360 grams/day

3. Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.
4. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia to find the total number of slices they ate:

Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices = Total slices eaten
10 + 7 + 14 = 31

"Let's denote the time Donovan took to make his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's time as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal is the sum of the time Betsy and Donovan took, which is 98 minutes. So we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

Now that we know Donovan's part took 40 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 minutes to Donovan's time:

\[ Betsy's\ part = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

So, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pizzas each group ate and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas they ordered to find out how many are left.

First, let's calculate the number of pizzas the glee club ate:
- The glee club ordered 20 pizzas.
- They ate 70% of them, which is 0.70 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

Now, let's calculate the number of pizzas the football team ate:
- The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.
- They ate 80% of them, which is 0.80 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

Next, we'll find out how many pizzas are left from each group:
- The glee club has 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left.
- The football team has 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left.

Finally, we add the remaining pizzas from both groups to get the total number of pizzas left:

"To find out how much Anthony spends on postage, we need to calculate the cost for both the small and big coupons and then add them together.

First, we calculate the number of big coupons:
- Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, so he will send out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons.

Next, we calculate the cost for the small coupons:
- Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

Then, we calculate the cost for the big coupons:
- Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

Finally, we add the costs together to get the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of small coupons + cost of big coupons = 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:
- Total cost in dollars = 24500 cents / 100 = $245.

So, Anthony spends $245 on postage total.

The promotion at the grocery store is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys at full price, he gets the next pound at half price.

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. For the first pound, he pays $4.00, and for the second pound, he pays $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00. Therefore, for every two pounds, he pays $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Since he needs 6 pounds, we can divide this by 2 to find out how many times he will take advantage of the promotion:
6 pounds / 2 pounds per promotion = 3 times the promotion.

So, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter will be:
3 times * $6.00 = $18.00.

The final cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:

3. Subtract the total eaten by the first and second monkeys from the total number of bananas to find out how many the third monkey eats in a week.
4. Divide the weekly amount eaten by the third monkey by 7 to find the daily amount.

Let's do the calculations:

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day, so in a week (7 days), the first monkey eats:
   10 bananas/day * 7 days/week = 70 bananas/week

2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day, so the second monkey eats:
   (10 bananas/day + 4 bananas/day) * 7 days/week = 14 bananas/day * 7 days/week = 98 bananas/week

3. The total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week is:

First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since a dozen (12) roses cost $15, we can find the cost of 15 roses by calculating the cost of 12 roses and the cost of the remaining 3 roses.

Cost of 12 roses: $15
Cost of 3 roses: 3 * $2 = $6

Total cost of 15 roses: $15 + $6 = $21

2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend paid for the watch.
3. Determine the discount Mr. Rogers' friend received from the original price.
4. Calculate the percentage discount based on the original price.

Step 1: Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price.
Original price of the watch = $2000
Price Mr. Rogers paid = 75% of $2000 = 0.75 * $2000 = $1500

Step 2: Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he paid.
Price Mr. Rogers' friend paid = 120% of $1500 = 1.20 * $1500 = $1800

Step 3: Determine the discount Mr. Rogers' friend received from the original price.
Discount = Original price - Price Mr. Rogers' friend paid = $2000 - $1800 = $200

- Jenny bought 10 bunches, so the total cost is 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00.

Finally, we find the savings by subtracting the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount Harry gets as \( H \).

According to the problem, we have two equations:

1. \( S + H = 100 \) (the total amount of fence)
2. \( H = S + 60 \) (Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( S \):

\( S + (S + 60) = 100 \)
\( 2S + 60 = 100 \)
\( 2S = 100 - 60 \)
\( 2S = 40 \)
\( S = 20 \)

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we can set up a proportion based on the rate of growth given:

8 inches / 4 years = x inches / 13 years

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and divide:

x = (8 inches * 13 years) / 4 years

Now we calculate the value of x:

x = (104 inches*years) / 4 years
x = 26 inches

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply by their respective prices.

First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes sold: 50% of 300 = 0.5 * 300 = 150 bikes
- BMX bikes sold: 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45 bikes
- MTB bikes sold: The rest of the bikes, which is 300 - (150 + 45) = 300 - 195 = 105 bikes

Now, let's calculate the earnings from each type of bike:

- Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 bikes * $450 = $67,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 bikes * ($500 / 2) = 45 bikes * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 bikes * $500 = $52,500

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes to get the total earnings:

Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
Total earnings = $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500
Total earnings = $131,250

"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field after a 6-hour day, we need to calculate the total number of bales the farmer makes and subtract the total number of bales the truck picks up.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour. Over 6 hours, the farmer will make:
5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour. Over 6 hours, the truck will pick up:
3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales

The number of bales left in the field after 6 hours is the difference between the bales made and the bales picked up:
30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales

"To find out how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class during the week and then add the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's calculate the total minutes John spends in class during a normal school day:
- A normal student has 6 periods, but John has 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods a day.
- Each class is 40 minutes long, so in one day he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes in class.

Next, let's calculate the total minutes he spends in class during the week:
- He goes to class for 5 days a week, so he spends 5 * 320 = 1600 minutes in class during the week.

Now, let's calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday:
- He spends 1/16 of his weekly class minutes each on Saturday and Sunday, so for each day, he spends 1600 / 16 = 100 minutes.
- For both Saturday and Sunday, he spends 2 * 100 = 200 minutes.

Finally, let's calculate the total minutes he spends learning during the week:
- The total minutes spent learning is the sum of the minutes spent in class and the extra learning time, which is 1600 + 200 = 1800 minutes.

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
- 1800 minutes / 60 = 30 hours.

So, John spends 30 hours a week learning.

"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height it reaches after the first bounce and then apply the 2/3rds ratio again for the second bounce.

First, we determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped. Since each story is 24 feet high and Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony, the initial height is:

Initial height = 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet

After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3rds of the initial height:

First bounce height = 72 feet * (2/3) = 48 feet

After the second bounce, the ball again reaches 2/3rds of the height it reached after the first bounce:

Second bounce height = 48 feet * (2/3) = 32 feet

So, the ball goes 32 feet high on its second bounce.

"To find the height of the fourth child in inches, we need to convert the heights of the other children to inches and then use the given relationships to determine the height of the fourth child.

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.
2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.
3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.
4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The height of the fourth child is 72 inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat left, because the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex.

2. The 540 kilograms is what was left after the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. So, before the T-Rex ate, there were 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops.

Therefore, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

"To calculate the cost to paint the room, we need to determine the total area of the walls and then figure out how many gallons of paint are required.

First, let's calculate the area of the north and south walls:
- Each wall is 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
- The area of one wall is 10 x 8 = 80 square feet.
- Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

Next, let's calculate the area of the east and west walls:
- Each wall is 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
- The area of one wall is 5 x 8 = 40 square feet.
- Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all four walls to get the total area to be painted:
- Total area = 160 (north and south) + 80 (east and west) = 240 square feet.

A gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so we need to determine how many gallons are required:
- Number of gallons needed = Total area / Coverage per gallon = 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Finally, we calculate the cost of the paint:
- Cost = Number of gallons x Cost per gallon = 12 x $12 = $144.

The cost to paint the room is $144.

"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of picking a shaken soda from the remaining sodas.

Initially, there are 12 sodas in total, with 3 of them being shaken. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda, leaving 11 sodas (3 shaken and 8 unshaken). Ellen's brother then takes 1 shaken and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 10 sodas in total (2 shaken and 8 unshaken - 2 = 6 unshaken).

Now, there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left, making a total of 8 sodas. The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left:

Probability = Number of shaken sodas / Total number of sodas
Probability = 2 / 8
Probability = 1 / 4

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Percentage = (1 / 4) * 100
Percentage = 25%

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy takes off (20% of the total days).
3. Calculate the number of days Billy works.
4. Calculate the number of people Billy helps per day.
5. Multiply the number of people helped per day by the number of days he works to get the total number of people helped.

Let's start with step 1:

- March has 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.
- Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

Step 2:

- Billy takes 20% of the days off.
- Days off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.

Step 3:

- Days Billy works = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Step 4:

- Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day.
- People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.

Step 5:

- Total people helped = People helped per day * Days worked = 6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find Jeff's age, we can start by determining Martha's age. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4 years
Martha's age = 24 years - 4 years
Martha's age = 20 years

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10 years
Jeff's age = 20 years + 10 years
Jeff's age = 30 years

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old.

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

We are told that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on, so we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 15:

\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work to save for a 20-year retirement, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount based on her current savings rate.

1. Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs for retirement:
   40% of her current annual salary is $100,000 * 0.40 = $40,000 per year.

2. Calculate the total amount needed for 20 years of retirement:
   $40,000 per year * 20 years = $800,000.

3. Calculate the amount Lauren saves from each paycheck:
   She saves 20% of her current annual salary, which is $100,000 * 0.20 = $20,000 per year.

4. Determine how many years it will take to save the total amount needed:
   Total amount needed / Amount saved per year = $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for a 20-year retirement at 40% of her current annual salary.

To find the total number of students, we divide the number of boys by 40% (or 0.40):

Total Students = 240 boys / 0.40

Now we can calculate the total number of students:

Total Students = 240 / 0.40
Total Students = 600

Since 40% of the school population are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we can calculate 60% of the total number of students:

Number of Girls = 60% * Total Students
Number of Girls = 0.60 * 600
Number of Girls = 360

"To find out how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we need to calculate the distance for one round trip and then multiply it by the number of visits he makes in a month.

First, we calculate the distance for one way:
- Speed = 70 mph
- Time = 2 hours

Distance (one way) = Speed * Time
Distance (one way) = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance (one way) = 140 miles

Since this is a round trip, we need to double the one-way distance to get the total distance for one visit:
Distance (round trip) = Distance (one way) * 2
Distance (round trip) = 140 miles * 2
Distance (round trip) = 280 miles

John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the round trip distance by the number of visits:
Distance (monthly) = Distance (round trip) * Number of visits
Distance (monthly) = 280 miles * 2
Distance (monthly) = 560 miles

So, the total distance John drives in a month when visiting his parents is 560 miles.

"To find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we can first calculate the total number of toys produced by the other four workers during their 10-hour shift.

The two workers who produce 6 toys an hour will produce:
2 workers * 6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys

The other two workers who produce 4 toys an hour will produce:
2 workers * 4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys

Together, these four workers produce:
120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys

The manufacturer needs 400 toys for the order and still needs 20 toys after the 10-hour shift, which means they have produced:
400 toys - 20 toys = 380 toys

Since the four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced the difference:
380 toys - 200 toys = 180 toys

The fifth worker produced 180 toys over the 10-hour shift, so the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys/hour

"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we first need to calculate the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
1/4 * 60 = 15 pounds

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
1/2 * 60 = 30 pounds

Now, we add the weight of all three dogs together:
Kory's dog: 60 pounds
Elijah's first dog: 15 pounds
Elijah's second dog: 30 pounds

60 + 15 + 30 = 105 pounds

The total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs altogether is 105 pounds.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob and kept 9 for himself. This means Kris had 7 + 9 = 16 stickers before giving any to Rob.

2. These 16 stickers were the half that Luis did not use, which means Luis originally had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers before giving half to Kris.

3. The 32 stickers Luis had were the half that Seth gave him, so Seth originally had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers.

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

"To find out how many small bags John can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of M&M's John has by multiplying the number of large bags by the weight of each large bag.
2. Determine the total number of M&M's by multiplying the total weight by the number of M&M's per ounce.
3. Calculate the number of small bags by dividing the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag.

Let's do the math:

1. Total weight of M&M's: 3 large bags * 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces
2. Total number of M&M's: 30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's
3. Number of small bags: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag = 90 small bags

So, John can make 90 small bags.

"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth, we need to calculate half of the Earth's circumference and then divide that by the distance Alfie flies each day.

Half of the Earth's circumference is:
40,000 kilometers / 2 = 20,000 kilometers

Now, we divide the half-circumference by the distance Alfie flies each day:
20,000 kilometers / 400 kilometers/day = 50 days

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth.

"To solve the problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as V.

According to the problem, two years ago Liam's age was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so we can write the equation:

14 = 2 * V

Now we can solve for V:

V = 14 / 2
V = 7

This means that Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find out how old Vince is now, we add 2 years to his age from two years ago:

Vince's current age = V + 2
Vince's current age = 7 + 2
Vince's current age = 9

So, Vince is 9 years old now.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted 56 eggs in total.
2. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.
3. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.
4. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

Let's use variables to represent the number of eggs each person painted:
- Let A be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
- Let M be the number of eggs Madeline painted.
- Let C be the number of eggs Camden painted.
- Let S be the number of eggs Sarah painted.

From the information given, we can write the following equations:
1. A + M + C + S = 56 (total eggs painted)
2. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
3. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
4. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah)

We can substitute A for M in the first equation and C for S + 12 in the third equation to get:
1. A + A + (S + 12) + S = 56
2. 2A + 2S + 12 = 56
3. 2A + 2S = 44
4. A + S = 22 (dividing the equation by 2)

Now we can solve for S using the third equation (C + S = 30) and the fourth equation (C = S + 12):
1. (S + 12) + S = 30
2. 2S + 12 = 30
3. 2S = 18
4. S = 9 (Sarah painted 9 eggs)

Now that we know S, we can find C:
1. C = S + 12
2. C = 9 + 12
3. C = 21 (Camden painted 21 eggs)

Now we can find A using the equation A + S = 22:
1. A + 9 = 22
2. A = 13 (Arnold painted 13 eggs)

Finally, we can find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
1. C - A = 21 - 13
2. C - A = 8

Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, and then convert that weight from ounces to pounds.

First, we find out how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make with 200 crayons:
200 crayons / 8 crayons per group = 25 groups

Since each group goes into a box, there will be 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the weight of the crayons:
200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces

Then, we calculate the weight of the boxes:
25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

Now, we add the weight of the crayons and the boxes to get the total weight in ounces:
200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:
400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds.

2. Determine how many 4-foot logs can be made from the usable length.
3. Calculate the total number of planks from all the 4-foot logs.
4. Multiply the total number of planks by the price per plank to find the total earnings.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Usable length for logs: 80 feet * 80% = 80 feet * 0.8 = 64 feet
2. Number of 4-foot logs: 64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs
3. Total number of planks: 16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks
4. Total earnings: 80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

So, John makes $96.

"To find the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how much Valerie's brother earns.
2. Calculate the combined salary of Valerie and her brother.
3. Calculate how much their mother earns.
4. Add up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to get the total.

Step 1: Valerie's brother earns twice what Valerie earns, so:
Brother's salary = 2 * Valerie's salary
Brother's salary = 2 * $5000
Brother's salary = $10000

Step 2: The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is:
Combined salary = Valerie's salary + Brother's salary
Combined salary = $5000 + $10000
Combined salary = $15000

Step 3: Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so:
Mother's salary = 2 * Combined salary
Mother's salary = 2 * $15000
Mother's salary = $30000

Step 4: The total amount of money they all have together is:
Total = Valerie's salary + Brother's salary + Mother's salary
Total = $5000 + $10000 + $30000
Total = $45000

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Grandma to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk and add that to the 40 minutes she spends on the beach.

Let's denote the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, her speed there is \( 2v \) miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, so we can calculate her speed on the beach:
\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk at twice the speed:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{2v} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time for the 3-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

"To find out how many marbles Bob has initially, we can set up an equation based on the information given. If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 24. So, if we let x represent the number of marbles Bob has initially, we can write the equation:

x + 24 = 60

Now, we solve for x:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

So, Bob has 36 marbles initially. If he loses 10 marbles, we can subtract 10 from 36 to find out how many marbles he will have:

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water. The resulting temperature \( T_{\text{result}} \) of the mixture can be calculated using the weighted average of the temperatures, where the weights are the volumes of water:

\[ T_{\text{result}} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{4 + 1} \]

We know that \( T_{\text{result}} \) must be at least 40 degrees:

\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40 \]

Now we solve for \( T \):

\[ 4 \times 33 + T \geq 40 \times 5 \]
\[ 132 + T \geq 200 \]
\[ T \geq 200 - 132 \]
\[ T \geq 68 \]

So, the water in the second mug must be at least 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the increase in the number of cows and chickens and then add these to the initial numbers.

First, let's calculate the increase in the number of cows:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in three weeks, there are 3 * 7 = 21 days.
- The total number of cows added in three weeks is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.

Now, let's calculate the increase in the number of chickens:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- In three weeks, the total number of chickens added is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add the initial number of animals to the increase:
- Initial cows: 50
- Initial chickens: 20
- Total cows after three weeks: 50 + 420 = 470
- Total chickens after three weeks: 20 + 210 = 230

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals:
- Total animals = Total cows + Total chickens
- Total animals = 470 + 230 = 700

2. Calculate the discount amount:
   10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

3. Subtract the discount from the total cost to get the discounted total:
   $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

4. Calculate the total number of bagels:
   4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels

5. Divide the discounted total cost by the total number of bagels to get the cost per bagel:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So we calculate:

23 scoops - 5 scoops = 18 scoops

Next, we need to determine how many potatoes are used to make a certain number of scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So we calculate:

6 potatoes - 3 potatoes = 3 potatoes
3 scoops - 1 scoop = 2 scoops

This means that 3 potatoes are used to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are used per scoop, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops:

3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop

Now we can calculate how many potatoes Gomer ate by multiplying the number of scoops he ate by the number of potatoes per scoop:

18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes per scoop = 27 potatoes

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of eggs he eats and then convert that number into dozens.

First, we calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

Next, we calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the following 30 days:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the two amounts to get the total number of eggs for 60 days:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens Chester will need:
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

"To find the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probability of winning with the first ticket by the probability of winning with the second ticket.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket, so its probability of winning is 3 times 0.20, which is 0.60.

Now, we multiply the two probabilities together to find the probability that both tickets win:

0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.12 * 100 = 12%

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

4. Subtract the number of bottles Hortex can currently produce (4200) from the total number of bottles needed to find out how many more bottles are required.

Let's do the math:

1. Bottles needed per person for 100% energy: 5 bottles
2. Total bottles needed for 2300 people: 5 bottles/person * 2300 people = 11500 bottles
3. Additional bottles needed: 11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Carla has identical octuplets, which means there are 8 babies in total.
2. She dresses 3/4 of them in purple, which is 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies.
3. She dresses 1/4 of them in blue, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 babies.
4. All the blue-wearers (2 babies) and 1/3 of the purple wearers (1/3 * 6 = 2 babies) also wear bows.
5. Therefore, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies.
6. We want to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. Since 2 out of the 4 babies wearing bows are wearing purple, the probability is 2/4 = 1/2.

To convert this probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

1/2 * 100 = 50%

So, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%.

"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week: 5168
Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday: 1907
Total reports received on Thursday and Friday: 2136

Now, let's calculate the number of reports received on Wednesday:

5168 - 1907 - 2136 = 1125

So, the IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday.

"Abraham initially owns 80 square meters of land.

He sold half of the land, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters, for $50.

After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his original land, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters, for $30.

The remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

He then sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter, which is 20 * 3 = $60.

The total money earned from selling all his land is $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

"To find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found by all the participants and subtract that from the total number of eggs Cole hid.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, which is 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, which is 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, which is 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs found:
5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs found.

Finally, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:
36 (total hidden) - 27 (found) = 9 eggs still hidden.

"To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
2. Find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
3. Calculate the total number of collections per week.
4. Multiply the total number of collections by the amount he gets paid per collection.

Step 1: The third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined.
- The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.
- 60% of 400 is 0.60 * 400 = 240 apartments.
- Therefore, the third complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Step 2: The total number of apartments John collects garbage from is:
- 200 (first complex) + 200 (second complex) + 640 (third complex) = 1040 apartments.

Step 3: John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is:
- 1040 apartments * 3 collections/week = 3120 collections/week.

Step 4: John gets paid $.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are:
- 3120 collections/week * $0.40/collection = $1248/week.

Therefore, John makes $1248 in a week.

"To find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old avocado tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. A 10-year-old avocado tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.
5. An 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, which is 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
6. During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit, so it's 0 fruits.

Now, we need to calculate the number of fruits for the first four years. Since the problem does not specify the number of fruits produced by the tree in its first four years, we will assume that it does not produce any fruits during these years, which is a common occurrence for young avocado trees.

So, the total number of fruits produced over 10 years is the sum of the fruits produced from year 5 to year 10:

0 (1st year) + 0 (2nd year) + 0 (3rd year) + 0 (4th year) + 50 (5th year) + 150 (6th year) + 350 (7th year) + 800 (8th year) + 0 (9th year) + 1000 (10th year) = 2350 fruits.

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters, and the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters.

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope:
   \( R = 4B \)

2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
   \( B = Y - 7 \)

3. The combined length of the 3 ropes is 37 centimeters:
   \( R + B + Y = 37 \)

We can substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the third equation:

\( 4B + B + Y = 37 \)

Since \( B = Y - 7 \), we can substitute \( B \) in the equation:

\( 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \)

Now, let's solve for \( Y \):

\( 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \)
\( 6Y - 35 = 37 \)
\( 6Y = 72 \)
\( Y = 12 \)

Now that we have \( Y \), we can find \( B \):

\( B = Y - 7 \)
\( B = 12 - 7 \)
\( B = 5 \)

Finally, we can find \( R \):

\( R = 4B \)
\( R = 4 \times 5 \)
\( R = 20 \)

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Ronnie was given $5.
2. Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, which means Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, let's say each of them gave their little sister $x.

3. After giving $x to their sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money. So, we can write the equation for Rissa's remaining money as:
   \( 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \)

4. Solving for x, we get:
   \( 15 - x = 12 \)
   \( x = 15 - 12 \)
   \( x = 3 \)

So, each of them gave $3 to their little sister.

5. Now, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with after giving $3 to his sister:
   \( 5 - 3 = 2 \)

Ronnie is left with $2.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of each color of paint used in the mural. We know that half the mural is yellow, and the remaining half is divided equally among red, white, and purple.

Let's denote the total amount of paint used as T, which is 12 pints. Half of the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint used is:

Yellow paint = 1/2 * T
Yellow paint = 1/2 * 12 pints
Yellow paint = 6 pints

The remaining half of the mural is 12 pints - 6 pints = 6 pints, which is divided equally among the three other colors (red, white, and purple). Therefore, the amount of paint used for each of these colors is:

Red paint = White paint = Purple paint = 1/3 * (T - Yellow paint)
Red paint = 1/3 * (12 pints - 6 pints)
Red paint = 1/3 * 6 pints
Red paint = 2 pints

So, 2 pints of red paint was used.

"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, and then add them all together.

First, we calculate the area of one bedroom:
20 feet * 12 feet = 240 square feet

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area for the bedrooms is:
240 square feet/bedroom * 4 bedrooms = 960 square feet

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is:
240 square feet * 5 = 1200 square feet

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, we add the areas together to get the total area of the house:
960 square feet (bedrooms) + 1200 square feet (living room) + 1000 square feet (rest of the house) = 3160 square feet

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

"To find out how many clouds Alice counted in total from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of clouds she saw each day and then sum them up.

On Monday, she counts 3 clouds.
On Tuesday, she counts double the number from Monday, which is 3 * 2 = 6 clouds.
On Wednesday, she counts double the number from Tuesday, which is 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she counts double the number from Wednesday, which is 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she counts double the number from Thursday, which is 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.

Now, we add up all the clouds from each day to get the total:

3 (Monday) + 6 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 24 (Thursday) + 48 (Friday) = 93

So, the total number of clouds Alice counted from Monday to Friday is 93.

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box, we need to first determine how many pods are in the special size box and then calculate the cost per pod.

The regular box has 100 pods and costs $12. The special size box has 20% more pods, so we calculate the number of additional pods:

20% of 100 pods = 0.20 * 100 = 20 pods

Therefore, the special size box has:

100 pods + 20 pods = 120 pods

The special size box also costs $12, so the cost per pod in the special size box is:

$12 / 120 pods = $0.10 per pod

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, the number of cycles you can run for $1 is:

$1 / $0.10 per pod = 10 cycles

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills. To find out how many $20 bills he has, we divide $1000 by $20:
   \( \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \) bills.

2. He loses 10 of these $20 bills, so he has:
   \( 50 - 10 = 40 \) bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill, so he uses:
   \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) bills, and he has \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) bills left.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he has 20 $20 bills left, the value of his money is:
   \( 20 \times 20 = 400 \) dollars.
   Tripling this amount gives him:
   \( 400 \times 3 = 1200 \) dollars.

5. He then converts all his money to $5 bills. To find out how many $5 bills he has, we divide $1200 by $5:
   \( \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \) bills.

So, Thomas has 240 $5 bills.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first half, team A scores 4 goals.
2. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.
3. In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.
4. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, so team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up all the goals:

- Team A's total goals: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B's total goals: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of team A's and team B's goals:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then determine how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk before it is less than 2 inches, using 20% of the remaining chalk each day.

1. Start with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
2. On Monday, the teacher uses 45% of the chalk, so the remaining chalk is 55% of the original piece.
3. Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday: 5 inches * 55% = 5 * 0.55 = 2.75 inches.
4. Each subsequent day, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk, so 80% of the chalk is left after each day.
5. We need to find out how many days it takes for the chalk to become less than 2 inches.

Let's calculate the remaining length of the chalk after each day:

- After Monday: 2.75 inches
- After Tuesday: 2.75 * 0.80 = 2.2 inches
- After Wednesday: 2.2 * 0.80 = 1.76 inches

After Wednesday, the chalk is less than 2 inches, so the teacher will have to recycle it. Therefore, the teacher can use the chalk for 2 more days (Tuesday and Wednesday) after Monday.

"To find out how many students are not on varsity, we first need to calculate how many boys and girls are on varsity.

One-third of the girls are on varsity:
1/3 * 12 girls = 4 girls

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity:
1/4 * 12 boys = 3 boys

Now, we add the number of boys and girls on varsity to get the total number of students on varsity:
4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students

The total number of students in the class is:
12 boys + 12 girls = 24 students

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to calculate the total number of teeth the dentist works on and then divide that by the total number of teeth James has, and finally multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. So, the number of teeth capped is:

4 (drilled) + 7 = 11 teeth capped

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:

4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth fixed

Now, to find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100:

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the first statement, we have:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
This is because Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.

From the second statement, we have:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]
This is because in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

We can solve this system by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

From the first equation, we can express \( W \) in terms of \( C \):
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Now we substitute \( W \) in the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]

Expand the left side:
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract 3C from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices her friends will eat:
6 friends * 6 slices each = 36 slices of cheese pizza

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we can find out how many cheese pizzas are needed by dividing the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 cheese pizzas

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices her friends will eat:
6 friends * 4 slices each = 24 slices of pepperoni pizza

Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we can find out how many pepperoni pizzas are needed by dividing the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pepperoni pizzas

Now, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas to find the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy:
3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 6 pizza pies in total.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs Jay can make in an hour and then determine how long it will take him to reach 60 snowballs.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour. However, since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we need to account for the melting over the course of an hour. There are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour, so 2 snowballs melt 4 times, which is a total of 8 snowballs that melt in an hour.

The net number of snowballs Jay can make in an hour is:
20 (built) - 8 (melted) = 12 snowballs per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take for Jay to make 60 snowballs at a rate of 12 snowballs per hour.

60 snowballs / 12 snowballs per hour = 5 hours.

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of John and Jim at the time Digimon came out and then use that information to find out how old Jim is now.

1. First, we know that Digimon had its 20th anniversary, which means it came out 20 years ago.
2. John is 28 years old now, so 20 years ago, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.
3. At that time, John was twice as old as Jim. If John was 8 years old, then Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses' station started with on the first day.

1. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
2. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages, and used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.

Now, let's calculate the total number of bandages used and received over the three days:

- Total bandages used: 38 (first day) + 28 (second day) + 25 (third day) = 91 bandages.
- Total bandages received: 50 (first day) + 100 (third day) = 150 bandages.

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. This means that the number of bandages they started with plus the bandages they received minus the bandages they used should equal 78.

Let's denote the number of bandages they started with as X. Then we can set up the following equation:

X (initial bandages) + 150 (received) - 91 (used) = 78 (left)

Now we solve for X:

X + 150 - 91 = 78
X + 59 = 78
X = 78 - 59
X = 19

So, the nurses' station started with 19 bandages on the first day.

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her monthly earnings from the hourly wage are:
$101.25/week * 4 weeks = $405

Next, we add the attendance bonus:
- Jen receives an additional $10 for each week of complete attendance.
- Since there are 4 weeks in April and she had no absences, she receives the bonus for all 4 weeks.

So, her total attendance bonus for April is:
$10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Now, we add her monthly earnings from the hourly wage to the attendance bonus to get her total earnings for April:
$405 + $40 = $445

Therefore, Jen will receive $445 in April.

"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the amount he earns for each task by the number of times he completed the task and then sum up all the earnings.

Here's the breakdown:

- Laundry: $3.00 * 1 = $3.00
- Cleaning his room: $1.50 * 1 = $1.50
- Taking the trash out: $0.75 * 2 = $1.50
- Emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 * 6 = $3.00

Now, we add up all the earnings:

$3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning room) + $1.50 (trash) + $3.00 (dishwasher) = $9.00

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in the two-week period.

"To find the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have, we first need to determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, a shark has:

3 * 40 gallons = 120 gallons of blood.

Now, to find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we multiply the amount of blood in one shark by ten:

120 gallons/shark * 10 sharks = 1200 gallons.

"To calculate the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times:

- In the morning, 50 people entered.
- At around 10:00, 40 more people entered.
- After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people.
- By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (in the morning) had entered, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, we add all these numbers together:

50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (after a while) + 150 (evening) = 320

"To find out how many pens Alain has, we need to calculate the total number of red and black pens.

First, we calculate the number of red pens:
5 packs of red pens * 5 pens per pack = 25 red pens

Next, we calculate the number of black pens:
Since she bought twice the amount of black pens than the red, we have:
2 * 5 packs of red pens = 10 packs of black pens
10 packs of black pens * 5 pens per pack = 50 black pens

Now, we add the number of red and black pens to find the total:
25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens

So, Alain has a total of 75 pens.

"To find out how much John spends on everything, we need to calculate the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the cost per bottle of scotch:
Cost per bottle of scotch = Total cost of scotch / Number of scotch bottles
Cost per bottle of scotch = $600 / 10
Cost per bottle of scotch = $60

Next, we determine the number of bottles of cognac John buys:
Number of cognac bottles = 2 * Number of scotch bottles
Number of cognac bottles = 2 * 10
Number of cognac bottles = 20

Now, we calculate the cost per bottle of cognac, which is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch:
Cost per bottle of cognac = Cost per bottle of scotch + (50% of cost per bottle of scotch)
Cost per bottle of cognac = $60 + (0.5 * $60)
Cost per bottle of cognac = $60 + $30
Cost per bottle of cognac = $90

Then, we calculate the total cost of the cognac:
Total cost of cognac = Number of cognac bottles * Cost per bottle of cognac
Total cost of cognac = 20 * $90
Total cost of cognac = $1800

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the cognac to find out how much John spends on everything:
Total spent = Total cost of scotch + Total cost of cognac
Total spent = $600 + $1800
Total spent = $2400

$2400"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

On the first day:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which means he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day:
- He planted 10 more White Oak trees, so he planted 20 (from the first day) + 10 = 30 White Oak trees in total over the two days.
- He planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day. 1/4 of 40 is 10, so he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

Now, let's add up all the trees he planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 30 trees.
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90 trees.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:
30 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 120 trees.

"Let's calculate the amount of root beer remaining after each event:

1. Fred made 24 gallons of root beer initially.
2. His children drank 4 gallons, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons were left.
3. Barbie spilled 7 gallons, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons were left.
4. Ronnie drank 5 gallons, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons were left.

Now, on the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, including Fred, so there were a total of 4 people (Fred + 3 guests).

The remaining 8 gallons of root beer were to be shared equally among the 4 people.

So, each person would get 8 / 4 = 2 gallons of root beer.

"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge as \( m \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as an equation:

\[ 4m + 8 = 40 \]

To find the value of \( m \), we need to solve the equation:

\[ 4m + 8 = 40 \]
\[ 4m = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4m = 32 \]
\[ m = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ m = 8 \]

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge.

"To find out how many fish have red stripes and blue stripes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of fish with red stripes.
2. Subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total to find the number of remaining fish.
3. Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish.
4. Add the number of fish with red stripes to the number of fish with blue stripes to get the total number of fish with either red or blue stripes.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Number of fish with red stripes:
   \( \frac{1}{3} \) of 66 fish = \( \frac{66}{3} \) = 22 fish

2. Number of remaining fish:
   66 fish - 22 fish = 44 fish

3. Number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish:
   \( \frac{5}{11} \) of 44 fish = \( \frac{5 \times 44}{11} \) = \( \frac{220}{11} \) = 20 fish

4. Total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes:
   22 fish (red stripes) + 20 fish (blue stripes) = 42 fish

So, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 42.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Amy originally had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, which totals to:
   2 palettes * 4 colors/palette = 8 colors

2. She also had three makeup sets with six eyeshadow colors each, which totals to:
   3 makeup sets * 6 colors/set = 18 colors

3. Her sister steals one of the palettes, so Amy loses 4 colors from the palettes. The remaining colors from the palettes are:
   8 colors - 4 colors = 4 colors

4. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since one makeup set has 6 colors, half of that is:
   6 colors / 2 = 3 colors

5. The remaining colors from that makeup set are:
   6 colors - 3 colors = 3 colors

6. The total number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is the sum of the remaining colors from the palettes and the makeup sets. She still has the full 6 colors from the two other makeup sets, plus the 3 remaining colors from the used makeup set, and the 4 colors from the remaining palette:
   4 colors (remaining palette) + 3 colors (used makeup set) + 2 * 6 colors (two full makeup sets) = 4 + 3 + 12 = 19 colors

So, Amy has 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To find out how high the roof is from the second floor's floor, we need to calculate the height of the house and then subtract the height of the first floor.

First, we calculate the height of the house:
House height = Mattison's height * 7
House height = 60 inches * 7
House height = 420 inches

Next, we calculate the height of the first floor:
First floor height = Mattison's height * 3
First floor height = 60 inches * 3
First floor height = 180 inches

Now, to find the height from the second floor's floor to the roof, we subtract the first floor height from the total house height:
Second floor to roof height = House height - First floor height
Second floor to roof height = 420 inches - 180 inches
Second floor to roof height = 240 inches

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information about the average distance the dogs need to walk per day.

The average distance for the 4 dogs is 3 miles per day. This means the total distance for all 4 dogs combined is 4 dogs * 3 miles/dog = 12 miles.

We already know the distance the first three dogs need to walk:
- The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
- The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
- The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.

The total distance for the first three dogs is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total distance the first three dogs need to walk from the total distance for all four dogs:
12 miles (total for all dogs) - 8 miles (total for the first three dogs) = 4 miles.

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

"John's house is worth $250,000, and he gets a loan worth 40% of that value.

First, we calculate the amount of the loan:
$250,000 * 40% = $250,000 * 0.40 = $100,000

Next, we calculate how much of the loan he uses to pay off his debts, which is 60% of the loan amount:
$100,000 * 60% = $100,000 * 0.60 = $60,000

To find out how much money he has leftover after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the total loan amount:
$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

So, the amount of money John has leftover after paying off his debts is:

"To find Trinity's profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

The cost price (CP) of the magazines is $72.

The selling price (SP) is 11/8 of the cost price, so we calculate it as follows:
SP = (11/8) * CP
SP = (11/8) * 72

Now, let's calculate the selling price:
SP = 11 * 9
SP = 99

The profit is the selling price minus the cost price:
Profit = SP - CP
Profit = 99 - 72

Now, let's calculate the profit:
Profit = 27

"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. On the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day. Over 3 days, it would remove:
   1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters

2. On the medium setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much as the low setting, which is 2 liters per day. Over 3 days, it would remove:
   2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters

3. On the high setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much as the medium setting, which is 4 liters per day. Over 5 days, it would remove:
   4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we need to calculate the total capacity of the classes in each school and then add them together.

First, let's find the capacity of each of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

120 students / 8 = 15 students

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

15 students/class * 2 classes = 30 students

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's school, which is just the capacity of his one class:

120 students (Ali's class) + 30 students (John's two classes) = 150 students

The combined capacity of both schools is 150 students.

"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the total amount he owes including the interest, and then subtract the amount he has already paid over the 11 months.

First, let's calculate the interest on the $300 that Stephen borrowed. The interest is 2% of $300.

Interest = 2% of $300
Interest = 0.02 * $300
Interest = $6

So, the total amount Stephen owes after including the interest is:

Total amount owed = Principal + Interest
Total amount owed = $300 + $6
Total amount owed = $306

Next, we need to calculate how much Stephen has paid over the 11 months. He pays $25 per month.

Amount paid over 11 months = $25 * 11
Amount paid over 11 months = $275

Now, we subtract the amount paid over 11 months from the total amount owed to find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month.

Amount to pay in the twelfth month = Total amount owed - Amount paid over 11 months
Amount to pay in the twelfth month = $306 - $275
Amount to pay in the twelfth month = $31

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month.

"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of diaper changes per day for both children.
2. Determine how many of those diaper changes Jordan's wife handles.
3. Subtract the number of diaper changes Jordan's wife handles from the total to find out how many Jordan changes.

Step 1: Total number of diaper changes per day
Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children.
Total diaper changes = 5 changes/child/day * 2 children = 10 changes/day

Step 2: Number of diaper changes Jordan's wife handles
Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers.
Wife's diaper changes = 10 changes/day * 1/2 = 5 changes/day

Step 3: Number of diaper changes Jordan handles
Jordan changes the remaining half of the diapers.
Jordan's diaper changes = Total diaper changes - Wife's diaper changes
Jordan's diaper changes = 10 changes/day - 5 changes/day = 5 changes/day

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to calculate the total number of jelly beans he estimated to be in the jar and then find out how many of those he estimated to be red. We can then compare his estimate of the number of red jelly beans to the true number, which is 900.

First, we calculate the volume of the jar:
Volume of the jar = base area * height
Volume of the jar = 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches
Volume of the jar = 36 * 15
Volume of the jar = 540 cubic inches

Next, we calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans, taking into account the 80% packing efficiency:
Effective volume = volume of the jar * packing efficiency
Effective volume = 540 cubic inches * 0.80
Effective volume = 432 cubic inches

Now, we calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar based on the effective volume and the volume of a single jelly bean:
Total number of jelly beans = effective volume / volume of a single jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red:
Estimated number of red jelly beans = total number of jelly beans * 30%
Estimated number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.30
Estimated number of red jelly beans = 864

The true number of red jelly beans is 900, so we can now calculate how far off Tim's guess was:
Difference = true number of red jelly beans - estimated number of red jelly beans
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The bus departed Chengli city with 20 people.
2. On the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, so the total number of people on the bus is now 20 + 40 = 60 people.
3. On the second stop, 3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered the bus. That's 3/4 * 40 = 30 people.
4. After the second stop, the total number of people on the bus is 60 + 30 = 90 people.
5. At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus is now 90 * 2 = 180 people.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people, so the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 200 - 180 = 20 people.

"To calculate the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost of visits before the price increase and the cost of visits after the price increase.

1. **Before the price increase:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost of one visit is $2.
   - She visits for 5 years.
   - Total cost before the increase = 3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years.

2. **After the price increase:**
   - The cost of one visit has increased by 150%.
   - 150% of $2 is $3 (150% * $2 = 1.5 * $2).
   - The new cost of one visit is $2 + $3 = $5.
   - She continues to visit 3 times a year for 3 more years.
   - Total cost after the increase = 3 visits/year * $5/visit * 3 years.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for both periods and sum them up.

Before the increase:
3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years = 3 * 2 * 5 = $30.

After the increase:
3 visits/year * $5/visit * 3 years = 3 * 5 * 3 = $45.

Total cost for all visits:
$30 (before) + $45 (after) = $75.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it will take for all the students to go through the escape room, given that only 8 students can try it at a time and each session lasts 45 minutes.

First, let's determine the total number of students who will be trying the escape room. There are 10 students from each of the 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th), so:

10 students/grade * 4 grades = 40 students

Now, we need to figure out how many groups of 8 students can be formed from these 40 students:

40 students / 8 students/group = 5 groups

Since each group takes 45 minutes to complete the escape room, we multiply the number of groups by the time each group takes:

5 groups * 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes

Therefore, it will take 225 minutes for all the students to try the escape room.

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 5x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

The length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The longer piece is 4 times this length:

"To find out how much of his secret seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of ground beef are needed for 80 meatballs.
2. Calculate the amount of seasoning needed based on the number of pounds of ground beef.

Step 1: Since Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs he wants to make by the number of meatballs per pound to find out how many pounds of ground beef he needs.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of ground beef

Step 2: Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. So, for 5 pounds of ground beef, he will need:

5 pounds of ground beef * 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let the number of cupcakes Carly makes be \( c \).
2. According to the problem, the number of brownies Carly makes is 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes, which can be expressed as \( 3c - 2 \).
3. Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats, so the total number of treats needed is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).
4. The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies, which is \( c + (3c - 2) \).
5. We can set up the equation: \( c + (3c - 2) = 10 \).

Now, let's solve the equation:

\[
c + 3c - 2 = 10
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
4c - 2 = 10

4. The discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.
5. Karen has 10 fingers, and nail art costs $3 per nail, so the total cost for nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.
6. The total cost for Karen is the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of the nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

Therefore, Karen would pay $90 in all.

"Susan has 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year, 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year, and another magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine.

The total number of issues from the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year is:
3 magazines * 12 issues/magazine = 36 issues

The total number of issues from the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year is:
1 magazine * 6 issues/magazine = 6 issues

The total number of issues from the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine is:
1 magazine * (6 issues/magazine * 4) = 24 issues

The total number of issues Susan gets every year is:
36 issues + 6 issues + 24 issues = 66 issues

"Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as K.

According to the problem, Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so we can write:
Shelley's paintings = K + 8

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can write:
Samantha's paintings = Shelley's paintings - 12
27 = (K + 8) - 12

Now we can solve for K:
27 = K + 8 - 12
27 = K - 4
K = 27 + 4
K = 31

Kim has 31 paintings.

"To find the final price of the toy after the changes in December and January, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after the 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after the 50% decrease.

Step 1: December price increase
The price in November was $40. An 80% increase means the price in December is:
\[ \text{December Price} = \text{November Price} + (\text{November Price} \times 80\%) \]
\[ \text{December Price} = 40 + (40 \times 0.80) \]
\[ \text{December Price} = 40 + 32 \]
\[ \text{December Price} = 72 \]

Step 2: January price decrease
The price in January is 50% less than the December price:
\[ \text{January Price} = \text{December Price} - (\text{December Price} \times 50\%) \]
\[ \text{January Price} = 72 - (72 \times 0.50) \]
\[ \text{January Price} = 72 - 36 \]
\[ \text{January Price} = 36 \]

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36.

"Charlie's standard rate is $80 per hour. For veterans, he reduces his rate by 25%, which means the reduced rate is 75% of $80.

First, let's calculate the reduced rate for veterans:
Reduced rate = 75% of $80
Reduced rate = 0.75 * $80
Reduced rate = $60

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make from the 4 standard rate lessons:
Total from standard rate lessons = 4 * $80
Total from standard rate lessons = $320

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make from the 2 reduced rate lessons for veterans:
Total from reduced rate lessons = 2 * $60
Total from reduced rate lessons = $120

Finally, let's add the two totals to find out the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:
Total for the day = Total from standard rate lessons + Total from reduced rate lessons
Total for the day = $320 + $120
Total for the day = $440

"Walter started with 60 apples. He ate 2/5 of them, which is:

\( 60 \times \frac{2}{5} = 24 \) apples.

So, he had \( 60 - 24 = 36 \) apples left.

He then gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples, which is:

\( 36 \times \frac{25}{100} = 9 \) apples.

After giving his sister 9 apples, he had \( 36 - 9 = 27 \) apples left.

He sold these 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each, so the total amount of money he received is:

"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up a simple equation based on the information given. If 9 novels represent 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, then we can represent the total number of novels she has written this year as \( x \).

The equation would be:
\[ \frac{3}{4}x = 9 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{3}{4} \), which is \( \frac{4}{3} \):
\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]
\[ x = 3 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To find the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then compare it to the total distance between Alaska and Texas.

First, we calculate the total distance Michael has traveled in 3 days. Since he is traveling at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days. Assuming he travels 24 hours a day (which is unlikely, but we'll use this for the sake of the calculation), the total hours traveled in 3 days would be:

3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance he has traveled:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

Now we have the distance Michael has traveled, which is 3600 km. To find out what percentage of the 6000 km distance between Alaska and Texas this represents, we use the following formula:

Percentage covered = (Distance traveled / Total distance) * 100%

Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100%
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100%
Percentage covered = 60%

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of teachers who were sick from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers who were called in.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of teachers who were sick = 13
Number of substitute teachers = 9

Number of teachers at school = Total number of teachers - Number of teachers who were sick + Number of substitute teachers
Number of teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9

Now, let's do the math:

82 - 13 = 69 (teachers who were not sick)
69 + 9 = 78 (total teachers at school including substitutes)

So, the number of teachers at school that day was 78.

"To find out how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

The weekly cost is the sum of the cost of the pasta, the cheddar cheese, and the gruyere cheese.

- Pasta cost: $1.00
- Cheddar cheese cost: $3.00
- Gruyere cheese cost: 2 * $3.00 = $6.00

Now, we add these costs together to get the total weekly cost:

Total weekly cost = Pasta cost + Cheddar cheese cost + Gruyere cheese cost
Total weekly cost = $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00
Total weekly cost = $10.00

There are 52 weeks in a year, so we multiply the weekly cost by 52 to get the yearly cost:

Yearly cost = Total weekly cost * 52
Yearly cost = $10.00 * 52
Yearly cost = $520.00

So, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year.

"To find the percentage of the day the custodian spends cleaning classrooms, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time the custodian has to clean all the classrooms.
2. Calculate the total time the custodian works in a day.
3. Calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning.

Step 1: Total time to clean all classrooms
- There are 80 classrooms.
- It takes 15 minutes to clean one classroom.
- Total time = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes.

Step 2: Total time the custodian works in a day
- The custodian works 8 hours a day.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Total time in a day = 8 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day.

Step 3: Calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning
- The custodian has 5 days to clean all the classrooms, so the average time spent cleaning per day is 1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes/day.
- The percentage of the day spent cleaning = (time spent cleaning per day / total time in a day) * 100.
- Percentage = (240 minutes/day / 480 minutes/day) * 100 = 50%.

"To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the total number of books that one bookcase can hold.

Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books, so together they can hold:
2 shelves * 10 books/shelf = 20 books

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold:
2 * 10 books = 20 books

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold:
20 books - 5 books = 15 books

Now, we add up the total number of books that one bookcase can hold:
20 books (middle shelves) + 20 books (bottom shelf) + 15 books (top shelf) = 55 books

Elly has 110 books in total. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold:
110 books / 55 books/bookcase = 2 bookcases

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To calculate Rose's profit, we need to determine her total cost and her total revenue from selling the eggs.

First, we calculate the total cost of the eggs:
- Rose bought five dozens of eggs.
- Each dozen costs $2.40.
- Total cost = 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs:
- There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so five dozens contain 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.
- Rose sells the eggs at a rate of $1 for 3 eggs.
- To find out how many sets of 3 eggs she can sell, we divide the total number of eggs by 3: 60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets.
- Total revenue = 20 sets * $1/set = $20.00

Finally, we calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
- Profit = $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00

Rose's profit is $8.00.

"To find out how many white hats Skyler has, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of red hats, which is half of the total number of hats.
2. Subtract the number of red hats from the total to find out how many hats are not red.
3. Calculate the number of blue hats, which is 3/5 of the remaining (non-red) hats.
4. Subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats to find out how many white hats there are.

Let's do the math:

1. Number of red hats: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \)
2. Remaining hats (not red): \( 100 - 50 = 50 \)
3. Number of blue hats: \( \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \)
4. Number of white hats: \( 50 - 30 = 20 \)

So, Skyler has 20 white hats.

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade, we need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly across both tests, and then subtract the number of questions she already got right on the first test.

First, let's find out the total number of questions across both tests:
70 questions (first test) + 40 questions (second test) = 110 questions (total)

Next, we calculate 70% of the total questions to find out how many she needs to answer correctly to pass:
70% of 110 questions = 0.70 * 110 = 77 questions

Now, we know that Audrey got 60% of the 70 questions correct on the first test:
60% of 70 questions = 0.60 * 70 = 42 questions

To find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly:
77 questions (needed to pass) - 42 questions (correct on the first test) = 35 questions

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can write:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Now we can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by plugging \( S \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights and candles that Brianna's family has.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights:
- There is 1 flashlight for each of the 4 people living in the house.
- There are 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms.

So the total number of flashlights is:
4 (for the people) + (2 * 8) (for the rooms) = 4 + 16 = 20 flashlights.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles:
- There are 4 small candles for half the rooms, which is 4 rooms (8 rooms / 2).
- There are 5 medium candles for the other half of the rooms, which is also 4 rooms.

So the total number of candles is:
(4 small candles * 4 rooms) + (5 medium candles * 4 rooms) = 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

"To solve this, let's break down the time taken for each side of the Rubik's cube:

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they each take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.
- The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so they each take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.
- The sixth side is completed when the fifth side is done, so it doesn't add any extra time.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides:

- First side: 5 minutes

"To calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to add the number of people he saw each day.

First day: 50 people
Second day: 50 people + 20 people = 70 people
Third day: 2 * 70 people = 140 people

For the remaining four days of the week, Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. So for those four days, the total number of people is:

4 days * 60 people/day = 240 people

Now, we add the number of people from each day to get the total for the week:

50 people (first day) + 70 people (second day) + 140 people (third day) + 240 people (remaining four days) = 500 people

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 500.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. In the following 30 seconds, four times the initial amount pop, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so it's 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.
5. After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add up all the kernels that popped:

20 (first 30 seconds) + 60 (second 30 seconds) + 80 (third 30 seconds) + 40 (fourth 30 seconds) + 10 (after heat) = 210

So, Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of lemons Tim will need for the lemonade for the pool party and the extra gallon for Allen.

First, we calculate the number of lemons needed for the 4 gallons of regular lemonade:
- 1 gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of lemon juice.
- 4 gallons of lemonade will require 4 cups of lemon juice.
- 6 lemons yield 1 cup of lemon juice.
- Therefore, 4 gallons of lemonade will require 4 * 6 = 24 lemons.

Next, we calculate the number of lemons needed for the extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart:
- 1 gallon of extra tart lemonade requires 2 cups of lemon juice (since it's twice as tart).
- 6 lemons yield 1 cup of lemon juice.
- Therefore, 1 gallon of extra tart lemonade will require 2 * 6 = 12 lemons.

Finally, we add the lemons needed for the regular lemonade and the extra tart lemonade:
- 24 lemons for the regular lemonade + 12 lemons for the extra tart lemonade = 36 lemons.

So, Tim will need 36 lemons in total.

"To find out how many kilograms of dog food the kennel house will need in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption for each type of dog and then multiply by 7 days.

For the German Shepherds:
3 German Shepherds * 5 kilograms per day = 15 kilograms per day

For the Bulldogs:
2 Bulldogs * 3 kilograms per day = 6 kilograms per day

Total daily consumption for all dogs:
15 kilograms (German Shepherds) + 6 kilograms (Bulldogs) = 21 kilograms per day

Total weekly consumption:
21 kilograms per day * 7 days = 147 kilograms per week

"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we need to calculate the total number of legs and then divide by 2 to get the number of pairs.

First, we calculate the total number of legs for the 2-legged animals:
10 animals * 2 legs/animal = 20 legs

Next, we calculate the total number of legs for the 4-legged animals:
15 animals * 4 legs/animal = 60 legs

Now, we add the total number of legs together:
20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

Finally, we divide the total number of legs by 2 to find the number of pairs:
80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs

"To find the number of red blocks, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of red blocks as \( R \).

The number of blue blocks is given as 4.
The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, so that's \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \).

The total number of blocks is the sum of blue, yellow, and red blocks, which is 32.

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]

Now, we solve for \( R \):
\[ 12 + R = 32 \]
\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

Therefore, there are 20 red blocks.

"To find out how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in each direction and then find the difference between the two distances.

First, we calculate the distance he traveled west:
Distance west = Speed * Time west
Distance west = 18 mph * 5 hours
Distance west = 90 miles

Next, we calculate the distance he traveled east:
Distance east = Speed * Time east
Distance east = 18 mph * 8 hours
Distance east = 144 miles

Now, we find the difference between the distance traveled east and the distance traveled west to determine how far he is from his house:
Distance from house = Distance east - Distance west
Distance from house = 144 miles - 90 miles
Distance from house = 54 miles

Elvis is 54 miles from his house now.

"To find the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to apply the depreciation rate for each year to the value of the boat at the beginning of that year.

1. After the first year, the boat depreciates by 30%. The value of the boat at the end of the first year is:
   \( 9000 - (9000 \times 0.30) = 9000 \times (1 - 0.30) = 9000 \times 0.70 \)

2. After the second year, the boat depreciates by another 30%. The value of the boat at the end of the second year is:
   \( 9000 \times 0.70 \times (1 - 0.30) = 9000 \times 0.70 \times 0.70 \)

3. After the third year, the boat depreciates by 20%. The value of the boat at the end of the third year is:
   \( 9000 \times 0.70 \times 0.70 \times (1 - 0.20) = 9000 \times 0.70 \times 0.70 \times 0.80 \)

Now, let's calculate the final value:

\( 9000 \times 0.70 \times 0.70 \times 0.80 \)

\( 9000 \times 0.343 \times 0.80 \)

\( 9000 \times 0.2744 \)

\( 2469.60 \)

The boat is worth $2469.60 after the three years.

"To find out how many pink candies are in the bag, we need to first determine the number of each color of candy and then subtract the total from the overall number of candies in the bag.

We know that:
- There are 54 red candies.
- There are twice as many orange candies as red candies, so there are 54 * 2 = 108 orange candies.
- There are half as many yellow candies as red candies, so there are 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

Now, let's add up the red, orange, and yellow candies:
54 (red) + 108 (orange) + 27 (yellow) = 189 candies.

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies in the bag:
232 - 189 = 43.

So, the number of pink candies is 43.

"To find out how much Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels during her trip, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel stays and the cost of the bus rides, and then add them together.

The cost of one night at the hotel is $80. Since Helen stayed for 3 nights, the total cost for the hotel is:
3 nights * $80/night = $240

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. So, the cost of one bus trip is:
10% of $80 = 0.10 * $80 = $8

Helen rode the bus 7 times, so the total cost for the bus rides is:
7 rides * $8/ride = $56

Now, we add the total cost of the hotel and the total cost of the bus rides to find the total amount Helen paid:
$240 (hotel) + $56 (bus) = $296

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to first determine how many marbles Dallas originally had before dropping 4 of them. 

Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4, so before dropping them, Dallas had:

21 marbles + 4 marbles = 25 marbles

Since Mazie had 52 marbles in total and gave all of them to the twins, and we know Dallas received 25 marbles, we can find out how many marbles Darla received by subtracting the number of marbles Dallas received from the total number of marbles:

52 marbles - 25 marbles = 27 marbles

So, Mazie gave Darla 27 marbles.

"To calculate the force John needs to push the car, we need to first determine the total weight of the car including the luggage and the children. Then we will calculate 1% of that total weight to find the force required.

Total weight of the car = weight of the car + weight of the luggage + weight of the children
Total weight of the car = 1200 pounds (car) + 250 pounds (luggage) + 75 pounds (child 1) + 75 pounds (child 2)

Total weight of the car = 1200 + 250 + 75 + 75
Total weight of the car = 1600 pounds

Now, the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight.

Force required = 1% of 1600 pounds
Force required = 0.01 * 1600
Force required = 16 pounds

Emma's age = 40 years + 16 years
Emma's age = 56 years

Now that we have both ages, we can calculate the average:

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 years + 56 years) / 2
Average age = 96 years / 2
Average age = 48 years

"To calculate the total cost of the place settings for Avery's holiday dinner, we need to multiply the cost of each type of plate and bowl by the number of guests, and then sum up the total.

The cost for the dinner plates is $6.00 each, so for 12 people, it would be:
12 * $6.00 = $72.00

The cost for the bowls is $5.00 each, so for 12 people, it would be:
12 * $5.00 = $60.00

The cost for the salad plates is $4.00 each, so for 12 people, it would be:
12 * $4.00 = $48.00

"To find out how much time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation:
- Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so that's 15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in one week she meditates for 30 minutes * 7 days = 210 minutes.
- In 4 weeks, she will meditate for 210 minutes * 4 = 840 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on yoga:
- Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour, 5 days a week, so that's 1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours per week.
- In 4 weeks, she will practice yoga for 5 hours * 4 = 20 hours.

Now, we need to convert the hours of yoga into minutes to add it to the meditation time:
- 20 hours of yoga is equal to 20 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1200 minutes.

Finally, we add the time spent on meditation and yoga together:

2. Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne.
3. Anne is twice the size of Albert.
4. Albert is 36 inches tall.

First, we find Anne's height:
Anne's height = 2 * Albert's height
Anne's height = 2 * 36 inches
Anne's height = 72 inches

Now, we know Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne:
Jackie's current height = Anne's height - 2 inches
Jackie's current height = 72 inches - 2 inches
Jackie's current height = 70 inches

Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, so to find her height before the summer, we subtract 3 inches from her current height:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Randy starts with:
   - 9 oatmeal cookies
   - 4 chocolate chip cookies
   - 5 sugar cookies

2. He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
   - Oatmeal: 9 - 1 = 8
   - Chocolate chip: 4 - 1 = 3
   - Sugar: 5 - 1 = 4

3. He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
   - Oatmeal: 8 - 2 = 6

4. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
   - Sugar: 4 - 2 = 2

5. Then, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
   - Oatmeal: 6 + 4 = 10
   - Chocolate chip: 3 + 4 = 7
   - Sugar: 2 + 4 = 6

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies Randy has:
- Oatmeal: 10
- Chocolate chip: 7
- Sugar: 6

Total cookies = 10 + 7 + 6 = 23

"To calculate how much money Matthew would earn, we need to determine the earnings from each half of his collection and then sum them up.

Matthew has 12 toy soldiers, so half of his collection is 12 / 2 = 6 toy soldiers.

For the first half, he would earn 6 toy soldiers * $5 per toy = $30.
For the second half, he would earn 6 toy soldiers * $7 per toy = $42.

The total amount he would earn is $30 + $42 = $72.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation.
   - The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days.
   - Total holes dug = 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

2. Next, we need to determine the net number of holes filled by Nate each day after he returns.
   - Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes each night.
   - Net holes filled per day = 9 holes/day - 6 holes/night = 3 holes/day

3. Now, we need to calculate how many days it will take Nate to fill in all the holes.
   - Total holes to fill = 84 holes
   - Days to fill all holes = Total holes / Net holes filled per day = 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

4. Finally, we need to convert the number of days into weeks.
   - Weeks to fill all holes = Days to fill all holes / 7 days/week = 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

So, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School first and then subtract it from the enrollment at Norman High School.

Norman High School's average enrollment: 4000 students
Butler High School's average enrollment: 3/4 * 4000

Let's calculate Butler High School's enrollment:
3/4 * 4000 = 3000 students

Now, we subtract Butler High School's enrollment from Norman High School's enrollment to find the difference:
4000 - 3000 = 1000 students

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made: 7995
Rainbow cookies: 2595
Oatmeal cookies: 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - Rainbow cookies - Oatmeal cookies
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 2595 - 3075

Now, let's do the math:

Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 2595 - 3075
Chocolate chip cookies = 5400 - 3075
Chocolate chip cookies = 2325

"To find out how many beakers Igor lost, we need to determine how many items he actually placed on the lab bench and compare that to what Dr. Grumpus requested.

Dr. Grumpus requested:
- 16 test tubes
- 7 beakers
- 14 Petri dishes

Igor gathered:
- Half as many test tubes as requested: 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes
- Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes
- The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers

The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29. We can set up the equation to find out how many beakers he lost:

8 (test tubes) + x (beakers) + 16 (Petri dishes) = 29

Now we solve for x (the number of beakers Igor actually placed on the lab bench):

8 + x + 16 = 29
24 + x = 29
x = 29 - 24
x = 5

Igor placed 5 beakers on the lab bench, but he was supposed to place 7. Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is:

7 - 5 = 2

"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws he will use for the tables and then subtract that from the number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, for one table, the number of screws needed is:
4 legs/table * 2 screws/leg = 8 screws/table

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is:
4 tables * 8 screws/table = 32 screws

James has 40 screws, so the number of screws he will have left over is:
40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws

"To find the total amount of money raised by the girls, we need to calculate the individual amounts and then sum them up.

1. Alexandra raises $430.
2. Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
3. Sarah raises $300.
4. Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we add up all the amounts:
$430 (Alexandra) + $750 (Kim) + $300 (Sarah) + $700 (Maryam) = $2180

The total amount of money raised by the girls is $2180.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it took for Vanessa to run her part of the race. We know that Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, and Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did.

First, let's find out how far Aaron ran. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles and that is twice the distance Aaron ran, Aaron must have run 2 miles.

Next, we need to find out how long it took Aaron to run 1 mile. Since Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes, we can divide the total time by the distance to find the time per mile:

16 minutes / 2 miles = 8 minutes per mile

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, it means that Vanessa takes twice as long to run each mile. Therefore, Vanessa takes:

8 minutes per mile * 2 = 16 minutes per mile

Now we can calculate the total time it took Vanessa to run her 4 miles:

16 minutes per mile * 4 miles = 64 minutes

So, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply 200 feet by 3:

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line/foot of dock = 600 feet of line

The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line, so we subtract that from the total required:

600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

"To calculate how much Tom's restaurant makes a week from reservations, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of one reservation.
2. Multiply the cost of one reservation by the number of reservations per night.
3. Multiply the nightly income by the number of days the restaurant is open per week.

Step 1: Cost of one reservation
- 2 meals at $5 each: 2 * $5 = $10
- 1 bottle of wine: $5
- Total cost per reservation: $10 + $5 = $15

Step 2: Nightly income
- Number of reservations per night: 6
- Income per night: 6 * $15 = $90

Step 3: Weekly income
- Days open per week: 2
- Weekly income: $90 * 2 = $180

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we first need to calculate the total selling price of all the watermelons, and then divide that by the number of watermelons.

The vendor made a profit of 25%, so the total selling price (SP) is 125% of the cost price (CP).

The cost price for 50 watermelons is $80, so the total selling price is:

SP = CP * (1 + Profit Percentage)
SP = $80 * (1 + 0.25)
SP = $80 * 1.25
SP = $100

Now, to find the selling price per watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:

Selling price per watermelon = SP / Number of watermelons
Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50
Selling price per watermelon = $2

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, which means she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.
2. James is now twice as old as Dora, so James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old.
3. John had James when he was 19, so John is now 19 + 18 = 37 years old.
4. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.
5. In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then find the difference.

First, we convert an hour into minutes:
1 hour = 60 minutes

Next, we calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges

Then, we calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 oranges

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Mark gets the radiator for 80% off, so he pays 20% of the original price. The cost of the radiator is $400, so he pays $400 * 20% = $80 for the radiator.

The mechanic charges $50 per hour for 3 hours, so the labor cost is $50 * 3 = $150.

The total cost is the cost of the radiator plus the labor cost, which is $80 + $150 = $230.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( c \) as the number of chickens
- \( k \) as the number of cows

We know that:
1. The total number of animals (chickens and cows) is 20, so:
   \( c + k = 20 \)

2. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70, so:
   \( 2c + 4k = 70 \)

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of \( c \) and \( k \).

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   \( c + 2k = 35 \)

Now we have the system:
   \( c + k = 20 \)
   \( c + 2k = 35 \)

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
   \( (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \)
   \( c + 2k - c - k = 15 \)
   \( k = 15 \)

Now that we know there are 15 cows, we can substitute \( k \) back into the first equation to find \( c \):
   \( c + 15 = 20 \)
   \( c = 20 - 15 \)
   \( c = 5 \)

So, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to calculate the total number of slices and then divide that number by the number of people.

There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:
7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people. To find out how many slices each person gets, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:
56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person

So, each of them can have 14 slices.
