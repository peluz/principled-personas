"To find out how much profit Josh made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's find the new value of the house. The repairs increased the value by 150%. This means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% original + 150% increase).

The original value of the house is $80,000. 

To find 250% of $80,000:
\[ 250\% \times 80,000 = 2.5 \times 80,000 = 200,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is $200,000.

Next, we calculate the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Purchase price} + \text{Repair cost} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{New value} - \text{Total cost} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is:
\[ 70,000 \]"
"To find out how many total meters James runs a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he does each session by the distance of each sprint, and then multiply that by the number of times he runs per week.

1. First, we find out how many meters he runs in one session:
   - He runs 3 sprints each session.
   - Each sprint is 60 meters.
   - So, in one session, he runs \(3 \times 60 = 180\) meters.

2. Next, we find out how many meters he runs in a week:
   - He runs 3 times a week.
   - So, in a week, he runs \(180 \times 3 = 540\) meters.

Therefore, the total meters James runs a week is 540.

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed Wendi gives her chickens each day.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily feed.

First, we know that each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day. Since Wendi has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is:
\[ 3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know that in the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed. So, the total amount of feed given by the afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how many cups of feed are needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed already given from the total daily feed:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To find out how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the glasses considering the discount on every second glass.

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.
2. The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.60 = $3.

This pattern repeats for every pair of glasses. So, for every two glasses, Kylar pays $5 + $3 = $8.

3. Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide 16 by 2 to find out how many pairs of glasses he is buying: 16 / 2 = 8 pairs.
4. The total cost for 8 pairs of glasses is 8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - So, Charleston has \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) sheep.

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - So, Toulouse has \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) sheep.

4. **Total Sheep:**
   - To find the total number of sheep, we add the sheep from all three cities.
   - Total sheep = Seattle's sheep + Charleston's sheep + Toulouse's sheep
   - Total sheep = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260

"First, let's calculate the distance John travels initially:
- John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

Now, let's calculate the distance John travels on his way back:
- He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles.
- For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
  - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
- For the remaining 1.5 hours (since 4 hours - 2.5 hours = 1.5 hours), he drives at 80 mph.
  - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

Total distance traveled on the way back:
- 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

Finally, let's find out how far John is from home:
- Initial distance from home = 180 miles.
- Distance traveled back = 135 miles.
- Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

3. Divide the total by the number of guesses to find the average.

First, let's identify the guesses:
- The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
- The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60.
- The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and 80 plus 20 is 100.

So, the guesses are:
- First friend: 80
- Second friend: 60
- Third friend: 100

Next, we calculate the total of these guesses:
\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

Finally, we find the average by dividing the total by the number of guesses (which is 3):
\[ \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

So, the average guess is:

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say the number of silver coins is \( S \).
2. According to the problem, the number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins, so the number of gold coins is \( S + 30 \).
3. The total number of coins is 110, so we can write the equation: \( S + (S + 30) = 110 \).
4. Simplify the equation: \( 2S + 30 = 110 \).
5. Subtract 30 from both sides: \( 2S = 80 \).
6. Divide both sides by 2: \( S = 40 \).

So, the number of silver coins is 40. Now, we need to find the number of gold coins:

7. Number of gold coins = \( S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70 \).

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Polly can throw the gold javelin when she is holding the sapphire gemstone and then find out how far outside the dragon's reach she can stand.

1. **Determine Polly's throwing distance with the gemstone:**
   - Without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet.
   - With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther.

   \[
   \text{Throwing distance with gemstone} = 3 \times 400 \text{ feet} = 1200 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Determine the dragon's reach:**
   - The dragon can breathe fire up to 1000 feet.

3. **Calculate the distance outside the dragon's reach:**
   - Polly needs to stand far enough to be outside the dragon's 1000 feet reach but still within her throwing distance of 1200 feet.

   \[
   \text{Distance outside the dragon's reach} = 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}
   \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"First, let's figure out how many calories are in the entire 300g bag of chips. Since there are 5 servings in the bag and each serving has 250 calories, the total calories in the bag are:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine how many calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily target of 2000 calories. You have already consumed 1800 calories, so:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to find out how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories. Since the entire bag (300g) has 1250 calories, we can set up a proportion to find the grams per calorie:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x \text{ grams}}{200 \text{ calories}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{300 \text{ grams} \times 200 \text{ calories}}{1250 \text{ calories}} \]

\[ x = \frac{60000}{1250} \]

\[ x = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"First, let's find out how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per tie:
\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so:
\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:
\[ \text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + (0.5 \times 40) = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:
\[ \text{Total spent on red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, we add the amount spent on blue ties to the amount spent on red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:
\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

1. **Time spent watching TV each session:**
   Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time.

2. **Time spent reading each session:**
   Jim reads for half as long as he watches TV. So, he reads for:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

3. **Total time spent on TV and reading each session:**
   Each session, Jim spends:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours (TV)} + 1 \text{ hour (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Total time spent on TV and reading each week:**
   Jim does this 3 times a week, so each week he spends:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

5. **Total time spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks:**
   Over 4 weeks, Jim spends:
   \[
   9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, the final answer is:

"To find the total number of gems in the chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem and then add them together.

1. **Diamonds**: The problem states there are 175 diamonds.
2. **Rubies**: The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds. So, we calculate the number of rubies as:
   \[
   175 - 35 = 140
   \]
3. **Emeralds**: The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies. So, we calculate the number of emeralds as:
   \[
   2 \times 140 = 280
   \]

Now, we add the number of each type of gem to find the total number of gems:
\[
175 + 140 + 280 = 595

"First, we need to find out how many boys there are. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 * 60
Number of boys = 120

Next, we need to find the total number of students by adding the number of boys and girls:

Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of students = 120 + 60
Total number of students = 180

Now, we know there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:

Number of teachers = Total number of students / Number of students per teacher
Number of teachers = 180 / 5
Number of teachers = 36

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year and then determine how many bags of dog food she will need.

1. Calculate the amount of dog food used in the first 180 days:
   - The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day.
   - For 180 days, the total amount of dog food is \(1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups}\).

2. Calculate the amount of dog food used in the remaining days of the first year:
   - A year has 365 days.
   - The remaining days after the first 180 days are \(365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days}\).
   - The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day for these remaining days.
   - For 185 days, the total amount of dog food is \(2 \text{ cups/day} \times 185 \text{ days} = 370 \text{ cups}\).

3. Calculate the total amount of dog food used in the first year:
   - Total dog food = dog food for the first 180 days + dog food for the remaining 185 days
   - Total dog food = \(180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups}\).

4. Determine how many bags of dog food are needed:
   - Each bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
   - Number of bags needed = total dog food / cups per bag
   - Number of bags needed = \(550 \text{ cups} / 110 \text{ cups/bag} = 5 \text{ bags}\).

So, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year."
"First, we need to find out how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can write:

\[ \text{Sarah's laundry} = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ 400 = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

To find David's laundry, we divide both sides by 4:

\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Sarah's laundry} \]

Substituting Sarah's laundry:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

"To find out how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the total cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 and in packages of 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 18 / 3 = 6 packages.
- The total cost for 6 packages is 6 * $2.50 = $15.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.00.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 18 / 2 = 9 packages.
- The total cost for 9 packages is 9 * $1.00 = $9.00.

Now, we compare the two total costs:
- The cost for packages of 3 is $15.00.
- The cost for packages of 2 is $9.00.

The amount of money saved by buying the flowers in packages of 2 instead of packages of 3 is:
$15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00

Therefore, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let \( W \) be the number of games the team won.
2. Let \( L \) be the number of games the team lost.
3. According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so:
   \[
   W + L = 22
   \]
4. The team won 8 more games than they lost, so:
   \[
   W = L + 8
   \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

\[
(L + 8) + L = 22
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
2L + 8 = 22
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[
2L = 14
\]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[
L = 7
\]

Now that we know \( L = 7 \), we can find \( W \):

\[
W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15
\]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Sylvie's monthly salary after 5 years of service.
2. Calculate the monthly salary after each of the next three years.
3. Convert the final monthly salary to an annual salary.

**Step 1: Determine Sylvie's monthly salary after 5 years of service.**

Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. After 5 years, her salary increases by 10% of the initial salary.

\[ \text{Increase} = 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]
\[ \text{New monthly salary} = 600 + 60 = 660 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the monthly salary after each of the next three years.**

Each year, her salary increases by 10% of the initial salary of $600.

- After the 6th year:
  \[ \text{Increase} = 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]
  \[ \text{New monthly salary} = 660 + 60 = 720 \]

- After the 7th year:
  \[ \text{Increase} = 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]
  \[ \text{New monthly salary} = 720 + 60 = 780 \]

- After the 8th year:
  \[ \text{Increase} = 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]
  \[ \text{New monthly salary} = 780 + 60 = 840 \]

**Step 3: Convert the final monthly salary to an annual salary.**

\[ \text{Annual salary} = 840 \times 12 = 10080 \]

So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is:

"To find out how many pounds of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad that both the adult and child dinosaurs will eat.

First, let's calculate the amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adult dinosaurs.

So, the total amount of potato salad for the adults is:
\[ 10 \, \text{lbs/adult} \times 20 \, \text{adults} = 200 \, \text{lbs} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats 5 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 5 child dinosaurs.

So, the total amount of potato salad for the children is:
\[ 5 \, \text{lbs/child} \times 5 \, \text{children} = 25 \, \text{lbs} \]

Now, we add the amounts for the adults and the children to find the total amount of potato salad needed:

2. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   - The number of dogs is 60.
   - The number of cats is 120.
   - Combined, the number of dogs and cats is \( 60 + 120 = 180 \).

3. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
   - Therefore, the number of rabbits is \( 180 - 12 = 168 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - The number of dogs is 60.
   - The number of cats is 120.
   - The number of rabbits is 168.

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the original volume of tomatoes before cooking.
2. Calculate how many cans of tomatoes were used.
3. Convert the number of cans into the number of tomatoes.

First, since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked into sauce, the original volume of tomatoes must have been twice the volume of the sauce. Freda made 32 ounces of sauce, so the original volume of tomatoes was:
\[ 32 \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes were used to get 64 ounces. We do this by dividing the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:
\[ 64 \div 16 = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Since each can contains three tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:

"First, let's figure out how many potted plants Mary has initially. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of potted plants she already has is:
\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, she received 18 new potted plants from the nursery. Adding these to her existing plants, the total number of potted plants she now has is:
\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary decides to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family. Since there are 40 ledges, she will give away:
\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:
\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell:
   \[
   20 + \left(\frac{1}{4} \times 20\right) = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ times}
   \]
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means the third friend pressed the doorbell:
   \[
   60 + 10 = 70 \text{ times}
   \]

Now, we add up all the doorbell presses:
\[
20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175
\]

So, the total number of doorbell rings is:

"To find out how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to figure out how many 3-mile segments are in the 42 miles of the city. We do this by dividing the total distance by the distance covered in each segment:

42 miles / 3 miles per segment = 14 segments

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, we multiply the number of segments by the time it takes to cover each one:

14 segments * 10 minutes per segment = 140 minutes

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to first calculate the inner dimensions of one box and then find the volume of one box. After that, we can multiply by 3 to get the total volume for all 3 boxes.

1. **Determine the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) inches
   - Inner width: \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) inches
   - Inner height: \( 4 - 2 = 2 \) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - Volume = length × width × height
   - Volume of one box = \( 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \) cubic inches

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Total volume = volume of one box × number of boxes
   - Total volume = \( 24 \times 3 = 72 \) cubic inches

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

"Let's break down the total TV watching time by each day:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: \( x \) (30-minute episodes)
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hour = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

The total time spent watching TV is 7 hours. We can set up the equation:

\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \]

Combine the constants:

\[ 5.5 + 0.5x = 7 \]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[ 0.5x = 1.5 \]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[ x = 3 \]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30-minute shows on Wednesday.

"To find out how many cookies Henry baked last year, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. Henry ends up with 110 cookies after dropping 5. So, before dropping any, he had:
   \[
   110 + 5 = 115 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. The 115 cookies are 15 more than he intended to bake. So, the number of cookies he intended to bake is:
   \[
   115 - 15 = 100 \text{ cookies}
   \]

3. He intended to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year. So, the number of cookies he baked last year is:
   \[
   100 \div 2 = 50 \text{ cookies}

"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate on average, we first need to calculate the total area of the fruit roll-ups each of them had.

For Beatrice:
- Her fruit roll-up was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- The total area for Beatrice's roll-up is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) roll-ups.

For Marcell:
- His fruit roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- The total area for Marcell's roll-up is \(3 \times 14 = 42\) roll-ups.

Next, we add the total areas of the fruit roll-ups they both had:
- Total area = \(48 + 42 = 90\) roll-ups.

To find the average, we divide the total area by the number of people (which is 2):
- Average = \(90 \div 2 = 45\).

So, on average, they ate 45 fruit roll-ups each.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how much water Julia's boat took on while she was rowing back to shore. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total distance Julia rowed:**
   - Julia took 16 seconds to row 20 feet.
   - The shore was 64 seconds away.
   - To find the total distance, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \left(\frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of water taken on:**
   - The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.
   - For 80 feet, the amount of water taken on is:
     \[
     \text{Water taken on} = \left(\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought.

For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- Each board cost $10.
- Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- Each board cost $16.
- Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

Total cost for all the lumber:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, let's calculate the selling price of the lumber after the 50% price increase.

For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- Original price per board = $10.
- New price per board = $10 + 50% of $10 = $10 + $5 = $15.
- Total selling price for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $15/board = $150.

For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- Original price per board = $16.
- New price per board = $16 + 50% of $16 = $16 + $8 = $24.
- Total selling price for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $24/board = $120.

Total selling price for all the lumber:
- Total selling price = $150 + $120 = $270.

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total selling price - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio of sugar to water that Katy uses, which is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water.

First, let's find the total number of parts in the ratio:
7 (sugar) + 13 (water) = 20 parts

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined. We need to find out how many of these 120 parts are sugar.

Since the total parts in the ratio is 20, we can find the value of one part by dividing the total amount (120) by the total number of parts (20):
120 / 20 = 6

Now, we know that each part is equal to 6 teaspoons or cups. Since the ratio of sugar is 7 parts, we can find the amount of sugar by multiplying the value of one part by 7:
6 * 7 = 42

So, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"First, let's find out what Lylah's salary was four years ago. If Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

Given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ 40000 = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]
\[ 40000 = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

To find Lylah's salary, we divide both sides by 1.30:

\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = 30769.23 \]

Next, we calculate Adrien's salary four years later. His salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, we calculate her new salary as follows:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add both of their new salaries to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:

\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

"To find out how many hours Sadie slept in total throughout the week, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday and Wednesday**: She slept 2 hours less each day than she did on Monday. So, for each of these days, she slept:
   \[
   8 - 2 = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]
   Since this is for two days, the total for Tuesday and Wednesday is:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. **Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday. So, for each of these days, she slept:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew.
4. When setting the table, Julia had 12 spoons left.

We need to find out how many spoons were in the package that Julia bought.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as \( x \).

After Julia bought her package and her husband gave her 5 more spoons, the total number of spoons she had was:
\[ x + 5 \]

Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew, so the number of spoons left is:
\[ (x + 5) - 3 \]

We know that after using 3 spoons, she had 12 spoons left:
\[ (x + 5) - 3 = 12 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]
\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is:

1. Determine how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday.
   - On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
   - On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday.
   - So, on Tuesday, he walked \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) miles.

2. Calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday.
   - On Monday, he walked 4 miles.
   - On Tuesday, he walked 24 miles.
   - Therefore, the total for Monday and Tuesday is \( 4 + 24 = 28 \) miles.

3. Find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday.
   - The total mileage from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles.
   - Subtract the total miles from Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage.
   - So, the miles walked on Wednesday is \( 41 - 28 = 13 \) miles.

"To find out how much Tom pays for car washes in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the monthly cost of car washes.
2. Multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year.

First, we know that Tom gets 4 car washes a month and each car wash costs $15. So, the monthly cost is:
4 car washes/month * $15/car wash = $60/month

Next, to find the yearly cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):
$60/month * 12 months/year = $720/year

So, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the subs:
2 subs * $7.50 each = $15.00

Next, the cost of the chips:
2 bags * $1.50 each = $3.00

Then, the cost of the cookies:
2 cookies * $1.00 each = $2.00

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost before the delivery fee and tip:
$15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of the total cost:
20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Now, let's add the delivery fee to the total cost:
$20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we add the tip:
$24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

So, the final cost of Rory's delivery order is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \).
2. According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees is \( 2Q \).
3. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the queens, baby bees, and worker bees:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

Solve for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]

Now, we can find the number of worker bees:
\[ 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

- Each bicycle has 2 tires.
- 5 people came by with bicycles, so that's 5 bicycles.
- The total number of bicycle tires is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total cost for the bicycle tires is \(10 \times 25 = 250\) cents.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the tricycles:
- Each tricycle has 3 tires.
- 3 people came by with tricycles, so that's 3 tricycles.
- The total number of tricycle tires is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total cost for the tricycle tires is \(9 \times 25 = 225\) cents.

Finally, let's calculate the cost for the unicycle:
- A unicycle has 1 tire.
- 1 person came by with a unicycle.
- The total number of unicycle tires is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.
- Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total cost for the unicycle tire is \(1 \times 25 = 25\) cents.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost for bicycle tires: 250 cents
- Total cost for tricycle tires: 225 cents
- Total cost for unicycle tire: 25 cents

The total amount in cents is \(250 + 225 + 25 = 500\) cents.

"To find out how much a bag of marbles would cost after 36 months with a 20% increase every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of price increases**: Since the price increases every two months, we need to find out how many two-month periods are in 36 months.
   \[
   \text{Number of increases} = \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/increase}} = 18 \text{ increases}
   \]

2. **Calculate the new price after each increase**: Each increase is 20% of the original price, which means the price is multiplied by 1.20 (100% + 20%) after each increase.

3. **Apply the increase 18 times**: We can use the formula for compound interest to find the final price:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1 + \text{Rate})^{\text{Number of Increases}}
   \]
   Here, the original price is $20, the rate is 0.20, and the number of increases is 18.
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}

   - Total cost of action figures = 3 * $5 = $15.

3. **Doll:**
   - The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
   - Cost of 3 action figures = 3 * $5 = $15.
   - So, the doll costs $15.

Now, we add up the total costs of all the toys:
- Total cost of all toys = Cost of red cars + Cost of action figures + Cost of doll
- Total cost of all toys = $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

"To solve this problem, we need to compare the cost of hiring an accountant with the income Jackie would lose by doing her taxes herself.

1. Calculate the income Jackie would lose by doing her taxes herself:
   - She would lose 3 hours of freelance work.
   - Her hourly rate is $35.
   - Total lost income = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.

2. Calculate the cost of hiring an accountant:
   - The accountant charges $90.

3. Compare the two costs:
   - If Jackie does her taxes herself, she loses $105.
   - If she hires an accountant, she pays $90.

4. Determine how much more money she will have by hiring the accountant:
   - Savings = Lost income - Accountant's fee
   - Savings = $105 - $90 = $15.

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to figure out how many eggs she needs in total to make 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, we multiply 15 by 3:

15 flans * 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs

Now, we know Sandra gets 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:

45 eggs / 9 eggs/session = 5 sessions

"Let's say Brooke's current age is \( B \) years. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is \( 2B \) years.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( 2B + 2 \).

According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. So we can write the equation:
\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ 3B = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 8 \]

So, Brooke is currently 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is:
\[ 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Seth is 16 years old.

"To find out how much Jessica will pay in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum on all her debts, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payment for all her debts. Then, we will increase this amount by 50% to find the new monthly payment. Finally, we will multiply this new monthly payment by 12 to find the annual payment.

1. Calculate the total minimum monthly payment:
   - Student loans: $300
   - Credit card: $200
   - Mortgage: $500
   Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

2. Calculate the 50% increase on the total minimum monthly payment:
   50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

3. Calculate the new monthly payment:
   New monthly payment = Total minimum monthly payment + 50% increase
   New monthly payment = $1000 + $500 = $1500

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many red roses Sandra ordered and how many are missing. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of white carnations:**
   - Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations.
   - Let \( C \) represent the number of white carnations.
   - Therefore, \( 5C = 200 \).
   - Solving for \( C \):
     \[
     C = \frac{200}{5} = 40
     \]
   - So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

2. **Determine the number of red roses:**
   - Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.
   - Let \( R \) represent the number of red roses.
   - Therefore, \( R = 4C \).
   - Substituting the value of \( C \):
     \[
     R = 4 \times 40 = 160
     \]
   - So, Sandra ordered 160 red roses.

3. **Determine how many red roses are missing:**
   - Fred has not delivered all the red roses.
   - To keep Sandra's business, Fred must deliver the missing red roses by 5 pm.
   - Since Sandra ordered 160 red roses, and we assume Fred has not delivered any yet, the number of red roses Fred must deliver is 160.

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the ages:**
   - Jan's age is given as 30.
   - Let Mark's current age be \( M \).
   - Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is \( M + 2 \).

2. **Set up the equation based on the information given:**
   - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
   - According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.

3. **Formulate the equation:**
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago is \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
   - Mark's age two years ago was 5 years more than this, so:
     \[
     M - 2 = 14 + 5
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     M - 2 = 19
     \]
   - Solve for \( M \):
     \[
     M = 19 + 2
     \]
     \[
     M = 21
     \]

4. **Determine Jean's age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark, so:
     \[
     \text{Jean's age} = M + 2 = 21 + 2 = 23
     \]

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

### Team 1 (Well-Rounded Team):
- Each runner runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
- Since there are 4 runners, the total time for Team 1 is:
  \[
  4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds}
  \]

### Team 2 (Less Well-Rounded Team):
- The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds.
- The second runner runs 3 seconds faster than the first runner, so:
  \[
  60 - 3 = 57 \text{ seconds}
  \]
- The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so:
  \[
  57 - 3 = 54 \text{ seconds}
  \]
- The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so:
  \[
  54 - 3 = 51 \text{ seconds}
  \]

Now, we add up the times for all four runners in Team 2:
\[
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Difference in Times:
- The total time for Team 1 is 220 seconds.
- The total time for Team 2 is 222 seconds.
- The difference in time is:
  \[
  222 - 220 = 2 \text{ seconds}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on one roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).
   - Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \).

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.
   - To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3, we calculate the difference in probabilities and express it as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
   - The difference in probabilities is \( 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \).
   - The percentage increase is \( \frac{0.25}{0.25} \times 100\% = 100\% \).

So, it is 100% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To find out how much 8 pens will cost, we first need to determine the cost of one pen.

1. We know that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30.
2. The cost of a pen is the sum of the cost of a pencil and an eraser:
   \[
   \text{Cost of a pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} = 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50
   \]
3. Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times 1.50 = 12.00
   \]

12.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pounds of carrots will be used and then find out how many pounds will not be used.

1. First, we calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the restaurants. Since each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots and there are 40 restaurants:
   \[
   2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} \times 40 \text{ restaurants} = 80 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Next, we subtract the total amount of carrots distributed from the total amount of carrots available to find out how many pounds will not be used:
   \[
   200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds}
   \]

So, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of Pokemon cards**: Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **First month collection**: She collected three times the initial number of cards.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Second month collection**: She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
   \]

4. **Third month collection**: She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   \text{Combined cards from first and second months} = 60 + 40 = 100
   \]
   \[
   2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards}
   \]

5. **Total number of cards now**: Add the initial number of cards to the cards collected over the three months.
   \[
   20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320
   \]

So, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is:

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher.
2. Calculate the payment from each publisher.
3. Add the payments from both publishers to find the total weekly earnings.

Step 1: Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:
\[ \frac{1000 \text{ sentences}}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences per publisher} \]

Step 2: Calculate the payment from each publisher:
- Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]
- Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Step 3: Add the payments from both publishers to find the total weekly earnings:
\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

"To find out how much money John made in the year after winning the award, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the increased salary due to the 5% raise.

1. **Calculate the one-time monetary reward:**
   - John receives $5000 as a one-time reward.

2. **Calculate John's original annual salary:**
   - John makes $2000 per week.
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Original annual salary = $2000 * 52 = $104,000.

3. **Calculate the new weekly salary after the 5% raise:**
   - 5% of $2000 = 0.05 * $2000 = $100.
   - New weekly salary = $2000 + $100 = $2100.

4. **Calculate the new annual salary with the raise:**
   - New annual salary = $2100 * 52 = $109,200.

5. **Calculate the total money made in the year:**
   - Total money = One-time reward + New annual salary
   - Total money = $5000 + $109,200 = $114,200.

So, the total amount of money John made that year is:

"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down the problem into parts and add up the slices used for each meal.

1. **Cheese on sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices for sandwiches: \( 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Cheese in omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice than each sandwich, so each omelet used \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices.
   - Total slices for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Cheese in macaroni and cheese for dinner:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese in the macaroni and cheese.
   - Total slices for macaroni and cheese: \( 8 \text{ slices} \).

Now, we add up all the slices of cheese used:

"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to get an average of 93, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the lowest score from the first five tests.
2. Calculate the total points needed for an average of 93 over the five highest scores.
3. Determine the score needed on the sixth test to reach this total.

First, let's list Brinley's scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86.

The lowest score is 71. We will exclude this score from our calculations.

Next, we need to find the total points required for an average of 93 over the five highest scores. The formula for the average is:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total Points}}{\text{Number of Tests}} \]

We want the average to be 93 over 5 tests:
\[ 93 = \frac{\text{Total Points}}{5} \]

Solving for Total Points:
\[ \text{Total Points} = 93 \times 5 = 465 \]

Now, we need to find out how many points Brinley has from the four highest scores:
\[ 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367 \]

Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The total points including the sixth test should be 465:
\[ 367 + x = 465 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 465 - 367 = 98 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 98 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

"To find out how much Joe's bag of candy weighs, we need to calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40g. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \text{ bars} \times 40 \text{ g/bar} = 1000 \text{ g} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of each candied apple. We know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, each candied apple weighs:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ g}}{2} = 20 \text{ g} \]

Since there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[ 80 \text{ apples} \times 20 \text{ g/apple} = 1600 \text{ g} \]

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
\[ 1000 \text{ g} + 1600 \text{ g} = 2600 \text{ g} \]

So, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:
\[ 2600 \text{ g} \]

"Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let \( r \) represent the number of red chickens and \( w \) represent the number of white chickens.

From the problem, we know:
1. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day.
2. The white chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( w = r + 2 \).

We can set up the equation for the total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substitute \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( r \):
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the total distance he walks, which is the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find the time he spends walking, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool now (in gallons).
   - Let \( B \) be the amount of water in the big pool now (in gallons).

2. **Understand the leak rate:**
   - Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.
   - 4 minutes ago, each pool had 4 gallons more water than they do now.

3. **Express the water amounts 4 minutes ago:**
   - 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons).
   - 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

4. **Set up the relationship 4 minutes ago:**
   - 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
     \[
     B + 16 = 2(S + 16)
     \]

5. **Set up the current relationship:**
   - Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
     \[
     B = 4S
     \]

6. **Solve the equations:**
   - Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
     \[
     4S + 16 = 2(S + 16)
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( S \):
     \[
     4S + 16 = 2S + 32
     \]
     \[
     4S - 2S = 32 - 16

"First, let's find out how many Pokemon cards James has in total after losing and buying some cards.

Initially, he has:
- 30 fire type
- 20 grass type
- 40 water type

After losing 8 water type cards, he has:
- 40 - 8 = 32 water type

After buying 14 more grass type cards, he has:
- 20 + 14 = 34 grass type

Now, the total number of cards he has is:
- 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards

To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage is:
33%"

1. **Determine the number of apples Jamal has:**
   - Andrea has 52 apples.
   - Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
   - Therefore, Jamal has \(52 - 8 = 44\) apples.

2. **Determine the number of bananas Jamal has:**
   - Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
   - Therefore, Jamal has \(44 + 4 = 48\) bananas.

3. **Determine the number of bananas Andrea has:**
   - Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
   - Therefore, Andrea has \(\frac{48}{2} = 24\) bananas.

4. **Calculate the total number of fruits:**
   - Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas.
   - Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas.
   - Total fruits = \(52 + 24 + 44 + 48\).

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla will need, we first need to figure out how many dozens of cookies she is making each day, and then calculate the total amount of flour needed.

1. **Calculate the number of dozens of cookies for each day:**
   - Today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we divide 36 by 12:
     \[
     36 \div 12 = 3 \text{ dozen cookies}
     \]
   - Tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. We divide 30 by 12:
     \[
     30 \div 12 = 2.5 \text{ dozen cookies}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of dozens of cookies:**
   - Total dozens of cookies = 3 (today) + 2.5 (tomorrow) = 5.5 dozen cookies

3. **Calculate the total cups of flour needed:**
   - Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, we multiply the total number of dozens by 2:
     \[
     5.5 \times 2 = 11 \text{ cups of flour}
     \]

So, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

"To find out how much Mr. Tan's net proceeds are from selling the house, we need to calculate the total expenses and subtract them from the selling price.

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   - Transfer fees are 3% of the selling price.
   - Selling price = $400,000
   - Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   - Brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   - Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000

3. **Calculate the total expenses:**
   - Total expenses = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee + Remaining loan amount
   - Total expenses = $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000 = $282,000

4. **Calculate the net proceeds:**
   - Net proceeds = Selling price - Total expenses
   - Net proceeds = $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are:

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Time to heat oil to 300 degrees:**
   - It takes 20 minutes.

2. **Time to heat oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees:**
   - It takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \( 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \) minutes.
   - So, the time to heat from 300 to 400 degrees is \( 20 + 8 = 28 \) minutes.

3. **Total time to heat the oil:**
   - Time to heat to 300 degrees + Time to heat from 300 to 400 degrees
   - \( 20 + 28 = 48 \) minutes.

4. **Time to cook the chicken:**
   - It takes 5 minutes less than the time to warm up the oil.
   - \( 48 - 5 = 43 \) minutes.

5. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:**
   - Time to heat the oil + Time to cook the chicken

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, let's break down the information given:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body, so it takes \(900 \div 10 = 90\) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes \(90 \times 2 = 180\) stitches.
4. The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800.

Now, let's add up the stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 \text{ (body)} + 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 1170 \text{ stitches} \]

The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800, so the remaining stitches for the two sleeves are:

"Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let's say Sam's current age is \( S \) and Ruby's current age is \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \)
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \)

First, we substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, we expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length taken by the topaz gemstones.
2. Subtract this length from the total length of the necklace to find the length taken by the sterling silver beads.
3. Determine how many sterling silver beads fit into the remaining length.

First, we know that each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long and Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace. So, the total length of the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we subtract the length of the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length taken by the sterling silver beads:

2. Calculate the time it takes for the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles.
3. Use the same distance to find out how long it takes for the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles.

Step 1: Determine the speed of the car in the slow lane.
The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed:
\[ \text{Speed of the slow lane car} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes for the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles.
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time for the fast lane car} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Step 3: Use the same distance to find out how long it takes for the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles.

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we calculate how many chocolate bars the adults get in total. There are 4 adults, and each gets 6 chocolate bars:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and these 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them:
\[ 16 \div 8 = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

"First, let's figure out how long Susan works in total. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since she takes a half-hour break, she actually works for 2.5 hours.

Next, we need to convert the working hours into minutes because her earnings are based on 10-minute intervals. 
2.5 hours = 2.5 * 60 minutes = 150 minutes.

Now, we calculate how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.
150 minutes / 10 minutes per interval = 15 intervals.

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.
15 intervals * $5 per interval = $75.

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Points After 3 Rounds:**
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
   - Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

2. **Points After the Fourth Round:**
   - Mike has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point: \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he does not get an extra point: \(18\) points.
   - Tony has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point: \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

3. **Total Points:**
   - Mike: 22 points
   - Jim: 18 points
   - Tony: 43 points

4. **Sum of All Points:**
   - Total points = \(22 + 18 + 43 = 83\)

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the amount of rice consumed per meal per person:**
   Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.

2. **Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal for the household:**
   There are 5 members in the household, so:
   \[
   0.2 \, \text{kg/person} \times 5 \, \text{people} = 1 \, \text{kg/meal}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of meals per day:**
   The household eats rice for lunch and dinner, so:
   \[
   2 \, \text{meals/day}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day:**
   \[
   1 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day}
   \]

5. **Determine the number of days the 42 kg bag of rice will last:**
   \[
   \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{2 \, \text{kg/day}} = 21 \, \text{days}

"To find out how much John pays a year for the driving service, we need to calculate the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus given to the driver.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- John travels 30 miles to work and 30 miles back each day, so that's 60 miles per day.
- He goes to work 5 days a week, so that's 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week.
- He works 50 weeks a year, so that's 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.

Next, we calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- He gets charged $2 per mile, so for 15,000 miles, the cost is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the total bonus given to the driver:
- He gives a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800.

Finally, we add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to find the total annual cost:
- Total cost = Cost of miles + Total bonus = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

"To find out how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from both his hourly wage and his weekly bonus, considering the company performed very well for the whole month.

1. **Calculate the number of working days in April:**
   - April typically has 30 days.
   - Watson works 5 days a week.
   - There are about 4.33 weeks in a month (30 days / 7 days per week).
   - Therefore, the number of working days in April is 5 days/week * 4.33 weeks = 21.65 days. We'll round this to 22 days for simplicity.

2. **Calculate Watson's earnings from his hourly wage:**
   - Watson works 10 hours each day.
   - He earns $10 per hour.
   - Total hours worked in April = 10 hours/day * 22 days = 220 hours.
   - Total earnings from hourly wage = 220 hours * $10/hour = $2200.

3. **Calculate Watson's weekly bonus:**
   - Watson gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.
   - There are 4.33 weeks in April.
   - Total bonus for April = 4.33 weeks * $300/week = $1299.

4. **Calculate total earnings for April:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from hourly wage + Total bonus
   - Total earnings = $2200 + $1299 = $3499.

Therefore, Watson made $3499 in April.

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total loaves produced each day**: 60 loaves.

2. **Loaves sold in the morning**: 
   - Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning.
   - \( \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \) loaves.

3. **Loaves left after the morning sales**:
   - Total loaves - Morning sales = 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

4. **Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening**:
   - Half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening.
   - Half of 20 loaves = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \) loaves.
   - These 10 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, so:
     - Loaves sold in the afternoon = \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) loaves.

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 5.

"First, let's figure out how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so:

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Now, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy also needs to lose 2 pounds, but it takes her 4 weeks to do so.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same 8 pounds that Joey loses in 4 weeks, we can set up the following calculation:

8 pounds (total weight to lose) / 2 pounds (per week that Sandy loses in 4 weeks) * 4 weeks (Sandy's time to lose 2 pounds) = 16 weeks

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let's say the number of players on the defense is \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it's \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it's \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is 105. So we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), first combine the terms on the left side. To do this, we need a common denominator, which is 2:
\[ \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

Now, multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Finally, divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the ratio given and the total number of electric wires to find the number of electric poles.

The ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

Given that the total number of electric wires is 45, we can set up the following proportion based on the ratio:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of electric poles}}{\text{Number of electric wires}} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Let \( x \) be the number of electric poles. Then we can write:

\[
\frac{x}{45} = \frac{1}{3}

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers = Total employees - Number of junior programmers.
   - Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60.

3. **Determine the monthly salary of senior programmers:**
   - Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month.
   - Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
   - Monthly salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400 = $2400.

4. **Calculate the total monthly salary for junior programmers:**
   - Number of junior programmers = 40.
   - Monthly salary of each junior programmer = $2000.
   - Total monthly salary for junior programmers = 40 \times $2000 = $80,000.

5. **Calculate the total monthly salary for senior programmers:**
   - Number of senior programmers = 60.
   - Monthly salary of each senior programmer = $2400.
   - Total monthly salary for senior programmers = 60 \times $2400 = $144,000.

6. **Calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:**
   - Total monthly salary for junior programmers = $80,000.
   - Total monthly salary for senior programmers = $144,000.
   - Total monthly salary for all programmers = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Let the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal be \( x \).

2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in. So, the number of people on the bus now is \( x + 5 \).

3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. So, the number of people on the bus now is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

4. Simplify the expression: \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

5. We know that there were 20 people heading to the third stop, so \( x + 6 = 20 \).

6. Solve for \( x \): \( x = 20 - 6 = 14 \).

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school:
   \( 24 - 2 = 22 \) lollipops left.
3. He gives 14 lollipops to his friends:
   \( 22 - 14 = 8 \) lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. Since he gave 14 lollipops to his friends, he buys:
   \( 2 \times 14 = 28 \) lollipops.
5. Adding the lollipops he bought to the ones he has left:
   \( 8 + 28 = 36 \) lollipops.
6. He eats 3 lollipops that night:
   \( 36 - 3 = 33 \) lollipops left.

"First, let's figure out how many rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they get $1 off. So, we divide $80 by $20:

\[ 80 \div 20 = 4 \]

This means they earned $4 in rewards.

On this shopping trip, they spent $43. They used their $4 in rewards, and the coupon took off twice the amount of the rewards. So, the coupon took off:

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Now, we subtract the rewards and the coupon amount from the total spent:

\[ 43 - 4 - 8 = 31 \]

So, the customer paid $31 on this shopping trip.

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let the number of students in each of the two equal groups be \( x \).
2. The smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of the equal groups, so it has \( x - 10 \) students.
3. The total number of students in the class is 200, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   x + x + (x - 10) = 200
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   3x - 10 = 200

"To find out what percentage more the factory is making per day now compared to when they made tractors, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily earnings when they made tractors.
2. Calculate the daily earnings now that they make silos.
3. Find the difference in daily earnings.
4. Calculate the percentage increase based on the original daily earnings from tractors.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily earnings when they made tractors.**
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.
- Daily earnings from tractors = 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day.

**Step 2: Calculate the daily earnings now that they make silos.**
- They sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.
- Daily earnings from silos = 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day.

**Step 3: Find the difference in daily earnings.**
- Difference in daily earnings = Daily earnings from silos - Daily earnings from tractors
- Difference = $1100/day - $1000/day = $100/day.

**Step 4: Calculate the percentage increase.**
- Percentage increase = (Difference in daily earnings / Original daily earnings from tractors) * 100
- Percentage increase = ($100/day / $1000/day) * 100 = 10%.

1. **Calculate the total distance for one complete trip:**
   - Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
   - Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
   - Distance from the third city to the first city: 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs.

   First, find the combined distance of the first two legs:
   \[
   75 \text{ miles} + 100 \text{ miles} = 175 \text{ miles}
   \]

   Now, subtract 50 miles from this combined distance to find the distance from the third city to the first city:
   \[
   175 \text{ miles} - 50 \text{ miles} = 125 \text{ miles}
   \]

   So, the total distance for one complete trip is:
   \[
   75 \text{ miles} + 100 \text{ miles} + 125 \text{ miles} = 300 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total distance traveled in one day:**
   The train makes this trip 3 times a day:
   \[
   300 \text{ miles/trip} \times 3 \text{ trips/day} = 900 \text{ miles/day}
   \]

3. **Determine how many days it takes to reach 18,000 miles:**
   The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it takes to travel 18,000 miles, divide the total service distance by the daily distance:
   \[
   \frac{18,000 \text{ miles}}{900 \text{ miles/day}} = 20 \text{ days}
   \]

So, the train goes between services every 20 days.

"First, let's find out how much stuffing is needed for a collie bed. A collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed, it is 2 pounds. The average is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Rottweiler stuffing} + \text{Chihuahua stuffing}}{2} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, a collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds:

- For 4 chihuahua beds: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds
- For 3 collie beds: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) pounds

Adding these together gives the total amount of stuffing needed:

\[
8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

"To find out how much milk Mary collects every day, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. **Milk from the first half of the sheep:**
   - Mary has 30 sheep in total.
   - Half of them is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) sheep.
   - Each of these 15 sheep gives 1 kg of milk.
   - So, the total milk from the first half is \( 15 \times 1 = 15 \) kg.

2. **Milk from the second half of the sheep:**
   - The other half is also 15 sheep.
   - Each of these 15 sheep gives 2 kg of milk.
   - So, the total milk from the second half is \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) kg.

Now, we add the milk from both halves to get the total amount of milk collected every day:
- Total milk = Milk from the first half + Milk from the second half
- Total milk = 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

So, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

"To find out how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and then subtract that from the cost of the cable package.

1. **Cost of Netflix**: $10 per month.
2. **Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus**:
   - Normally, each costs $10 per month.
   - Since he gets a 20% discount for bundling, the discount on each service is 20% of $10, which is $2.
   - Therefore, the discounted price for each service is $10 - $2 = $8 per month.
   - For both Hulu and Disney Plus, the total cost is $8 + $8 = $16 per month.

3. **Total cost of streaming services**:
   - Netflix: $10
   - Hulu and Disney Plus: $16
   - Total: $10 + $16 = $26 per month.

4. **Savings**:
   - Cost of cable package: $60 per month.

So, the total number of pre-made cards is 2 * 15 = 30 cards. Adding the cards she made, Erica had 20 + 30 = 50 cards initially.

Next, we need to determine how many cards she passed out. She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, which totals 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

Now, we subtract the number of cards she passed out from the total number of cards she had initially. So, 50 - 29 = 21 cards are left.

Finally, we need to add the 17 cards she received from family and friends to the cards she has left. So, 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

Therefore, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

"First, let's figure out how many slices Bill and Mark each get.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices:
1/3 of 12 slices = 12 slices * (1/3) = 4 slices

Next, Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. So:
1/4 of 12 slices = 12 slices * (1/4) = 3 slices

Now, let's add up the slices given to Bill and Mark:
4 slices (Bill) + 3 slices (Mark) = 7 slices

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, the total number of slices eaten or given away is:
7 slices (Bill and Mark) + 2 slices (Jenny) = 9 slices

Finally, to find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten or given away from the total number of slices:
12 slices (total) - 9 slices (eaten or given away) = 3 slices

"To find the total number of bugs Nancy counted, we need to calculate the number of each type of bug and then add them together.

1. **Spiders**: Nancy saw 90 spiders.
2. **Millipedes**: The number of millipedes is 1/3rd the number of spiders. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{90}{3} = 30
   \]
3. **Stink Bugs**: The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
   \]

Now, we add the number of each type of bug to find the total:
\[
\text{Total bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168

"To find out how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy usage of the air conditioner.
2. Determine the reduction in daily energy usage when the air conditioner is used for fewer hours.
3. Calculate the total energy saved over 30 days.

First, let's calculate the daily energy usage of the air conditioner:
- The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour.
- Mel uses it for 8 hours a day.
- Daily energy usage = 900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watts/day.

Next, we convert the daily energy usage from watts to kilowatts:
- 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts.
- Daily energy usage in kilowatts = 7200 watts / 1000 = 7.2 kilowatts/day.

Now, let's determine the reduction in daily energy usage when the air conditioner is used for fewer hours:
- Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day.
- New usage time = 8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours/day.
- New daily energy usage = 900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watts/day.
- New daily energy usage in kilowatts = 2700 watts / 1000 = 2.7 kilowatts/day.

The reduction in daily energy usage is:
- Reduction in daily energy usage = 7.2 kilowatts/day - 2.7 kilowatts/day = 4.5 kilowatts/day.

Finally, we calculate the total energy saved over 30 days:
- Total energy saved = 4.5 kilowatts/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatts.

1. Calculate the total number of stripes:
   - Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\)
   - One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\)
   - One zebra with half as many stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(36 \div 2 = 18\)

   Adding these together gives the total number of stripes:
   \[
   34 + 36 + 18 = 88
   \]

2. Calculate the average number of stripes:
   - There are 4 zebras in total.
   - The average number of stripes is the total number of stripes divided by the number of zebras:
   \[
   \frac{88}{4} = 22

"To find out how much Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make to serve 20 people.
2. Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed.
3. Calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese.

Step 1: Determine the number of sandwiches needed.
- Each sandwich serves 4 people.
- There are 20 people.
- Number of sandwiches needed = 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed.
- Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
- For 5 sandwiches, Tyson needs 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost.
- Meat costs $7.00 per pound.
- Cheese costs $3.00 per pound.
- Total cost of meat = 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.
- Total cost of cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.
- Total cost for meat and cheese = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

So, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is:

"First, let's find out how many corns Allan originally has. Since there is twice as much corn as cannolis and he has 40 cannolis, we can calculate the number of corns as follows:

Number of corns = 2 × Number of cannolis
Number of corns = 2 × 40
Number of corns = 80

Next, Allan buys 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is:

New number of cannolis = Original number of cannolis + Additional cannolis
New number of cannolis = 40 + 60
New number of cannolis = 100

Now, Allan has 40 fewer corns than the new number of cannolis. So, the new number of corns is:

New number of corns = New number of cannolis - 40
New number of corns = 100 - 40
New number of corns = 60

Finally, to find the combined total of corns and cannolis, we add the new number of corns and the new number of cannolis:

Combined total = New number of corns + New number of cannolis
Combined total = 60 + 100
Combined total = 160

"First, let's figure out how many words are in the book. The book is 45 pages long and each page has 200 words. So, the total number of words in the book is:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Toby to read the book. Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. So, the time it takes for him to read the book is:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, and it takes 10 minutes to get there. So, the total time he needs to leave by is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since it takes Toby 30 minutes to read the book, he will finish reading and have:
\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early.

   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Pay rate per hour: $15
   - Total hours worked by all employees in May: 40 employees * 40 hours/employee = 1600 hours
   - Total payment for May: 1600 hours * $15/hour = $24,000

2. **Calculate the number of employees in June:**
   - 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees remained.
   - Number of employees in June: 40 * (3/4) = 30 employees

3. **Calculate the total payment for June:**
   - Total hours worked by all employees in June: 30 employees * 40 hours/employee = 1200 hours
   - Total payment for June: 1200 hours * $15/hour = $18,000

4. **Calculate the total payment for both months:**
   - Total payment for May and June: $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means the first pound costs $3 and the second pound costs half of $3, which is $1.50.

So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells. Sally bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25 and she bought 4 magnets:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from $10:
\[ 10 - 7.00 = 3.00 \]

So, Sally has $3.00 left.

"First, let's find out how much the second pack of fireworks costs. Since it's twice the amount of the first pack, which is $400, the second pack costs:
\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we add the cost of the first and second packs together:
\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Tim gets a 20% discount on these two packs. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1200:
\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost of the two packs:
\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the discount amount for one blouse.
2. Calculate the discounted price for one blouse.
3. Multiply the discounted price by the number of blouses Misha picks out.

First, let's find the discount amount for one blouse:
- The regular price of one blouse is $20.
- The discount is 30%, so we calculate 30% of $20.
- 30% of $20 is \( 0.30 \times 20 = 6 \).

Next, we calculate the discounted price for one blouse:
- The discounted price is the regular price minus the discount amount.
- So, the discounted price is \( 20 - 6 = 14 \).

Now, we find the total cost for 4 blouses:
- The total cost is the discounted price of one blouse multiplied by the number of blouses.
- So, the total cost is \( 14 \times 4 = 56 \).

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem step by step.

1. **Joanne's Apples:**
   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples
   - From the shortest trees: \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples
   - From the average trees: Let's call this number \( x \).

2. **Sister's Apples:**
   - From the tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples
   - From the shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples
   - From the average trees: 0 apples

3. **Total Apples Gathered:**
   - Joanne's total: \( 30 + 15 + x \)
   - Sister's total: \( 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \)
   - Combined total: \( (30 + 15 + x) + 105 = 500 \)

Now, let's set up the equation and solve for \( x \):

\[
30 + 15 + x + 105 = 500
\]

Combine the known values:

\[
150 + x = 500

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( C \) as the number of camels.
- \( D \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads (camels and dromedaries) is 180.
2. The total number of humps (camels have 2 humps each, and dromedaries have 1 hump each) is 304.

We can write these as two equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (total number of humps)

Now, we can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, we substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we have \( C \), we can find \( D \) using the first equation:
\[ D = 180 - C \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the original prices of the jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans were bought for $28 and saved $4, so the original price of the tattered jeans was \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The jogger jeans were bought for $22 and saved $2, so the original price of the jogger jeans was \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Kenny needed to make from selling the cards to cover the cost of the amusement park ticket and the spending cash.
2. Calculate how many cards he sold to make that amount of money.
3. Since he kept 1/3 of the cards, the number of cards he sold represents 2/3 of his total collection.

First, we calculate the total amount of money Kenny needed:
- Cost of the amusement park ticket: $100
- Spending cash: $50
- Total amount needed: $100 + $50 = $150

Next, we determine how many cards he sold to make $150:
- Price per card: $1.5
- Number of cards sold: $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

Since the 100 cards represent 2/3 of his total collection, we can find the total number of cards he started with:
- Let \( x \) be the total number of cards.
- \( \frac{2}{3}x = 100 \)
- \( x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \)

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - Therefore, he prepared 18 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 36 hotdogs for the second hotdogs.
   - Additionally, he prepared 1 hotdog for each of the remaining 18 guests.
   - So, the total number of hotdogs prepared is 36 (for the second hotdogs) + 18 (for the first hotdogs) = 54 hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs needed is 40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only had 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs needed is 80.
   - The shortage is 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs and there are 26 hotdogs short, 26 guests did not get their second hotdog.

So, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

"First, let's find out how much Charlotte's items cost before the discount.

1. The set of pots and pans costs $120.00.
2. The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
3. The 5 utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total cost before the discount:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Next, we need to calculate the discount. The discount is 20%, so we find 20% of $165.00:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount to find the final cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

So, the final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought and then find the difference between the two totals.

First, let's calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought:
- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack contains 20 beads.
- Total beads Elizabeth bought = (1 pack of red * 20 beads/pack) + (2 packs of clear * 20 beads/pack)
- Total beads Elizabeth bought = (1 * 20) + (2 * 20)
- Total beads Elizabeth bought = 20 + 40
- Total beads Elizabeth bought = 60

Next, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought:
- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack contains 20 beads.
- Total beads Margareth bought = (3 packs of blue * 20 beads/pack) + (4 packs of red * 20 beads/pack)
- Total beads Margareth bought = (3 * 20) + (4 * 20)
- Total beads Margareth bought = 60 + 80
- Total beads Margareth bought = 140

Now, we find the difference between the total number of beads each sister bought:

"First, let's calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon:

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it took James to complete each part of the triathlon:

- James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. 
  10% of 40 minutes = 0.10 * 40 = 4 minutes
  Time for James to swim = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

- James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike.
  Time for James to bike = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

- Let \( x \) be the time it took James to run.

Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
Total time for James = 170 + 10 = 180 minutes

Now, we can set up the equation for James' total time:
36 (swim) + 85 (bike) + \( x \) (run) = 180

Solving for \( x \):
36 + 85 + \( x \) = 180
121 + \( x \) = 180
\( x \) = 180 - 121
\( x \) = 59

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run.

"First, we need to find out how much soil Bob needs in total. We do this by calculating the volume of one raised bed and then multiplying by the number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
\[ \text{Total Volume} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} \]
\[ \text{Total Volume} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bags of potting soil Bob will need. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil:
\[ \text{Number of Bags} = \frac{\text{Total Volume}}{\text{Volume per Bag}} \]
\[ \text{Number of Bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} \]
\[ \text{Number of Bags} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the potting soil. Each bag costs $12:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Bags} \times \text{Cost per Bag} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars/bag} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of green cards:**
   - We know there are 15 red cards.
   - The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards.
   - 60% of 15 is calculated as \( 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \).
   - Therefore, the number of green cards is \( 15 + 9 = 24 \).

2. **Determine the number of yellow cards:**
   - The number of yellow cards is the sum of the number of red and green cards.
   - The number of yellow cards is \( 15 + 24 = 39 \).

3. **Calculate the total number of cards:**
   - The total number of cards is the sum of the red, green, and yellow cards.
   - The total number of cards is \( 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \).

So, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is:

"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots.

First, we add the total number of puppies:
8 (Jennifer's puppies) + 12 (Brandon's puppies) = 20 puppies in total.

Next, we add the number of puppies with spots:
3 (Jennifer's spotted puppies) + 4 (Brandon's spotted puppies) = 7 spotted puppies in total.

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of spotted puppies}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

Calculating the fraction:
\[ \frac{7}{20} = 0.35 \]

Then, converting to a percentage:
\[ 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is 35%.

"To find out how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of all the items he is buying and then divide that by the weight capacity of his truck.

1. **Sugar cubes**: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
2. **Carrots**: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
3. **Hay**: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
4. **Oats**: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the items:
- Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)
- Total weight = 4500 pounds

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
- Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
- Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip
- Number of trips = 2

Since the result is a whole number, the farmer will need exactly 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Sheets per room**: Each room has 2 sheets.
2. **Comforters per room**: Each room has 1 comforter.
3. **Pillow cases per room**: Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets. Since there are 2 sheets, there are \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.
4. **Towels per room**: Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases. Since there are 4 pillow cases, there are \(4 \times 2 = 8\) towels.

Now, let's calculate the total number of each type of laundry item for one room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Adding these together gives the total number of laundry items per room:
\[ 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15 \]

"To find out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is \( c \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be written as:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set the equation equal to 5:
\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):
\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we'll convert the remoras' lengths from inches to feet.
2. Calculate the total length of the remoras.
3. Determine the percentage of the shark's length that the remoras' total length represents.

First, convert the length of one remora from inches to feet:
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- 6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet

Since there are 2 remoras, the total length of the remoras is:
- 2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

Now, calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras' total length represents:
- Shark's length = 10 feet
- Remoras' total length = 1 foot
- Percentage = (Remoras' total length / Shark's length) * 100
- Percentage = (1 / 10) * 100 = 10%

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many eggs Jaime can place on the trays and then find out how many are left over.

1. First, we need to know how many eggs one tray can hold. According to the problem, one tray can hold 24 eggs.
2. Jaime has 2 trays, so we multiply the number of eggs one tray can hold by the number of trays:
   \[
   24 \text{ eggs/tray} \times 2 \text{ trays} = 48 \text{ eggs}
   \]
3. Jaime has 64 eggs in total. To find out how many eggs won't fit on the trays, we subtract the number of eggs that can be placed on the trays from the total number of eggs:
   \[
   64 \text{ eggs} - 48 \text{ eggs} = 16 \text{ eggs}
   \]

So, the number of eggs that won't be able to be placed on the tray is 16.

"First, let's figure out the total cost of the razors before applying the coupon. Since the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, Heather only needs to pay for one pack to get two packs.

The cost of one pack is $4.00. So, for two packs (with the buy one get one free deal), she pays $4.00.

Now, let's apply the $2.00 coupon to the total cost:
$4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00

Heather gets 2 packs of razors, and each pack contains 4 razors, so she gets a total of:
2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors

The cost per razor is the total cost divided by the number of razors:
$2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.25 to cents:
$0.25 = 25 cents

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Brett's age in four years:**
   Brett is currently 14 years old. In four years, he will be:
   \[
   14 + 4 = 18 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. **Set up the equation for Angela's age:**
   In four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Brett is currently 14 years old, so three times his current age is:
   \[
   3 \times 14 = 42
   \]
   This means in four years, Angela will be 42 years old.

3. **Determine Angela's current age:**
   If Angela will be 42 years old in four years, her current age is:
   \[
   42 - 4 = 38 \text{ years old}

"To find out how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation where the total cost of each venue is the same.

Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

For the first venue:
- The flat fee is $200.
- The cost of food is $5 per person, so for \( x \) guests, the food cost is \( 5x \).
- Therefore, the total cost for the first venue is \( 200 + 5x \).

For the second venue:
- The cost is $25 per person, so for \( x \) guests, the total cost is \( 25x \).

We set the total costs equal to each other to find the number of guests where the costs are the same:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"Let's use some simple math to figure this out. We know that:

1. Lily, David, and Bodhi together found 43 insects.
2. Lily found 7 more insects than David.
3. David found half as many insects as Bodhi.

Let's use \( D \) to represent the number of insects David found. Then:
- Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
- Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects (since David found half of what Bodhi found).

Now, we can set up an equation based on the total number of insects:
\[ D + (D + 7) + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Now we can find out how many insects Lily found:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Lily found 16 insects.

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of the skein they each used and then multiply by the total number of yards in a skein.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. First, we add these fractions:

1/4 + 1/2 = 1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4

This means they used 3/4 of a skein of yarn together. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we multiply 3/4 by 364 to find the total yards used:

3/4 * 364 = 273

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.
2. She bought 2 packs of strawberry gum.
3. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum.
4. She paid half as much for a pack of green apple gum as she did for the grape gum, which means she paid $2 / 2 = $1 for the green apple gum.
5. The total amount she paid for all the gum is $7.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the grape and green apple gums:
- Grape gum: $2
- Green apple gum: $1
- Total for grape and green apple gums: $2 + $1 = $3

Since the total amount paid is $7, the amount paid for the strawberry gum is:
- Total amount paid - Total for grape and green apple gums = $7 - $3 = $4

Since she bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, the cost per pack of strawberry gum is:
- Total cost of strawberry gum / Number of packs = $4 / 2 = $2

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of cows on the farm**: 30 cows
2. **Number of sheep on the zoo**: 20 sheep

Next, we need to verify the given conditions:
- The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
  - Number of cows on the zoo = 2 * Number of cows on the farm
  - Number of cows on the zoo = 2 * 30 = 60 cows

- The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.
  - Number of sheep on the farm = 1/2 * Number of sheep on the zoo
  - Number of sheep on the farm = 1/2 * 20 = 10 sheep

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals on both the farm and the zoo:
- **Total animals on the farm**: Number of cows + Number of sheep
  - Total animals on the farm = 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals

- **Total animals on the zoo**: Number of cows + Number of sheep
  - Total animals on the zoo = 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Finally, we add the total number of animals on the farm and the zoo:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days Andy has to reach his goal.
2. Determine the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.
3. Calculate the daily calorie deficit required to achieve this goal.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days.**

From December 31st to July 19th, we need to count the days in each month:
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July: 19 days (up to the 19th)

Adding these together:

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device.
2. Calculate the cost of Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device.
3. Calculate Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device.
4. Calculate the cost of Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device.
5. Find the difference in daily cost.
6. Multiply the difference in daily cost by 7 to find the weekly difference.

Let's go through each step:

1. **Daily electric consumption before adding the new device:**
   - Ada's daily consumption = 12 kilowatts per hour

2. **Cost of daily electric consumption before adding the new device:**
   - Cost per kilowatt per hour = $1.50
   - Daily cost = 12 kilowatts per hour * $1.50 per kilowatt per hour = $18

3. **Daily electric consumption after adding the new device:**
   - New device consumption = 2 kilowatts per hour
   - Total daily consumption = 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour

4. **Cost of daily electric consumption after adding the new device:**
   - Daily cost = 14 kilowatts per hour * $1.50 per kilowatt per hour = $21

5. **Difference in daily cost:**
   - Difference = $21 - $18 = $3

6. **Weekly difference:**
   - Weekly difference = $3 * 7 days = $21

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is $21.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the rate of one person:**
   - One person can paint half a house in 5 days.
   - Therefore, one person can paint a whole house in 10 days (since 5 days is for half a house).

2. **Convert days to hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - So, one person can paint a whole house in 10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours.

3. **Determine the rate for 5 people:**
   - If one person takes 240 hours to paint a house, then 5 people working together will take 240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours.

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"Let's start by figuring out how many chairs and sofas Ophelia has. We know that Ophelia has 20 sofas and that she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. This means Ophelia has:

\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ chairs} \]

Next, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, Jenna has:

\[ 3 \times 22 = 66 \text{ chairs} \]

Since Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has:

\[ 66 - 2 = 64 \text{ sofas} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together. Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, and Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs. Adding these together:

\[ 20 + 22 + 64 + 66 = 172 \]

So, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is:

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he didn't buy the headphone set, we first need to determine the cost of the headphone set. 

1. We know the total amount Tom spent is $48.
2. The cost of one CD is $4.
3. Subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount to find the cost of the headphone set:
   \[
   48 - 4 = 44
   \]
   So, the headphone set costs $44.

4. Now, to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought with the $44, we divide the cost of the headphone set by the cost of one CD:
   \[
   44 \div 4 = 11
   \]

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the variations in his routine:

1. Normally, he works out for 4 hours each week.
2. For 8 weeks, if he worked out 4 hours each week, the total would be \(4 \times 8 = 32\) hours.
3. However, there are exceptions:
   - For two consecutive weeks, he worked out 5 hours each week, which adds an extra hour each week for those two weeks. So, \(2 \times 1 = 2\) extra hours.
   - For one week, he worked out 6 hours, which is 2 hours more than the usual 4 hours.

Now, we add these extra hours to the base total:
- Base total: 32 hours
- Extra hours from 5-hour weeks: 2 hours
- Extra hours from 6-hour week: 2 hours

Total extra hours: \(2 + 2 = 4\) hours

Adding the extra hours to the base total:
\[32 + 4 = 36\]

So, the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks is 36.

2. **First stop:**
   - 8 passengers get off.
   - Number of passengers left: \( 48 - 8 = 40 \)
   - 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus.
   - Number of people getting on: \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \)
   - Number of passengers after the first stop: \( 40 + 40 = 80 \)

3. **Second stop:**
   - 21 passengers get off.
   - Number of passengers left: \( 80 - 21 = 59 \)
   - 3 times fewer passengers get on.
   - Number of people getting on: \( \frac{21}{3} = 7 \)
   - Number of passengers after the second stop: \( 59 + 7 = 66 \)

So, the final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years:**
   - Jame's current age is 22.
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \).

3. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - The cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \).

4. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - The cousin will be 55 in 8 years.
   - Therefore, the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \).

5. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - Jame's current age is 22.
   - The cousin's current age is 47.

"To find out how much one monitor costs, let's break down the information given:

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.
2. The computer costs $1,100.
3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's add the cost of the computer and the printer:
$1,100 (computer) + $700 (printer) = $1,800

The total cost of the 2 monitors can be found by subtracting the combined cost of the computer and printer from the total cost:
$2,400 (total) - $1,800 (computer + printer) = $600

Since this is the cost for 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is:
$600 / 2 = $300

So, the cost of one monitor is $300.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of boys and girls:**
   - There are 20 kids in total.
   - They are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys.
   - Therefore, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

2. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by each boy:**
   - Each boy brought back 60 shells.

3. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by each girl:**
   - Each girl brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.
   - This means each girl brought \( 60 + 4 \times 60 \) shells.
   - First, calculate \( 4 \times 60 \):
     \[
     4 \times 60 = 240
     \]
   - Then, add this to the 60 shells:
     \[
     60 + 240 = 300

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to add the thickness of each book together. Let's break it down step by step:

1. The thickness of the first book is 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books together:
\[ 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 31 + 50 = 81 \]
\[ 81 + 45 = 126 \]
\[ 126 + 62 = 188 \]

So, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we first need to add up the number of vlogs she has already made over the first three weeks.

1. Vlogs made in the first week: 18
2. Vlogs made in the second week: 21
3. Vlogs made in the third week: 15

Now, we add these numbers together:
\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma has made 54 vlogs so far. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make to reach her goal of 72 vlogs, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her total goal:
\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days in April:**
   April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Set up the relationship between the savings in the first and second halves:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half.
   - He saves twice as much each day in the second half, so he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half.

4. **Calculate the total savings for each half:**
   - Total savings in the first half: \( 15x \)
   - Total savings in the second half: \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)

5. **Set up the equation to meet the monthly saving target:**
   \[
   15x + 30x = 1125

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's say Brad gets \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money they are dividing is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} \]
\[ B = 20 \]

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to add the number of hamsters and the number of guinea pigs together.

First, we calculate the total number of hamsters:
- There are 3 cages of hamsters.
- Each cage has 10 hamsters.
- So, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, we calculate the total number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages of guinea pigs.
- Each cage has 5 guinea pigs.
- So, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs to get the total number of rodents:
- Total number of rodents = Total number of hamsters + Total number of guinea pigs
- Total number of rodents = 30 + 15 = 45

"First, let's find out how much Susan weighs. Since Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, we subtract 20 from Mark's weight:
150 - 20 = 130 pounds

Next, we find out how much Bob weighs. Since Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, we multiply Susan's weight by 2:
130 * 2 = 260 pounds

Now, we add the weights of Mark, Susan, and Bob to find the total weight:
150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends, which is 3:
540 / 3 = 180 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the movement of the sun and how it affects the angle from the ground to the sun.

1. **Initial Angle**: The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when viewed from Sahir's house.

2. **Sun's Movement**: The sun moves upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. Over 10 hours, the sun will move:
   \[
   5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Final Angle**: The final angle from the ground to the sun will be the sum of the initial angle and the angle the sun has moved upward:
   \[
   32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
   \]

So, the final angle from the ground to the sun is 82 degrees.

"First, we need to find out the ages of James's two sons. We know one son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, which means the other son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Next, we need to figure out how many candles James needs to buy. He needs 12 candles for the 12-year-old and 8 candles for the 8-year-old, so in total, he needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since the candles come in packs of 5, we need to determine how many packs of 5 candles James needs to buy to have at least 20 candles. To find this, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles in a pack: 20 / 5 = 4 packs.

Each pack costs $3, so to find the total cost, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 4 * 3 = $12.

Therefore, James spends $12 on candles.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages read in each week and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total reading time in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- So, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we convert the total reading time in the first week to pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \).
- The total number of pages read in the first week is \( 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \).

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Now, we add the pages read in both weeks:
- Total pages read in two weeks = 140 pages (first week) + 100 pages (second week) = 240 pages.

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Shiloh's age in 7 years:**
   Shiloh is currently 44 years old. In 7 years, he will be:
   \[
   44 + 7 = 51 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. **Set up the equation for the nephew's age:**
   Let \( n \) be the current age of Shiloh's nephew. In 7 years, the nephew will be:
   \[
   n + 7 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Use the given relationship:**
   In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   51 = 3(n + 7)
   \]

4. **Solve the equation:**
   First, expand the right side of the equation:
   \[
   51 = 3n + 21
   \]

   Next, isolate \( n \) by subtracting 21 from both sides:
   \[
   51 - 21 = 3n
   \]
   \[
   30 = 3n
   \]

   Finally, divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   n = 10
   \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

2. **Total from Email Invitations:**
   - The total number of people from the email invitations is \(100 + 200 = 300\).

3. **Phone Call Invitations:**
   - Alex calls 10 friends.
   - 8 of these friends will bring their spouses.
   - So, the number of additional people from the spouses is \(8 \times 1 = 8\).

4. **Total from Phone Call Invitations:**
   - The total number of people from the phone call invitations is \(10 + 8 = 18\).

5. **Total Number of Seats Needed:**
   - Adding the totals from both the email and phone call invitations gives us \(300 + 18 = 318\).

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.
2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher:
   \[
   10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund:
   \[
   20 \div 4 = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon:
   \[
   5 \times 44 = 220 \text{ pounds}
   \]

So, the Mastiff weighs 220 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet, starting from 4 feet and doubling in height each day.

Let's break it down day by day:

- **Day 0**: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall.
- **Day 1**: The beanstalk doubles to 4 * 2 = 8 feet.
- **Day 2**: The beanstalk doubles again to 8 * 2 = 16 feet.
- **Day 3**: The beanstalk doubles again to 16 * 2 = 32 feet.

On Day 3, the beanstalk is 32 feet tall, which is taller than 20 feet.

So, it takes 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many grams of protein are in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the total grams of protein John gets in one week (7 days).

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. So, if John eats 200 grams of mushrooms, he would get twice the amount of protein because 200 grams is double 100 grams.

\[ 3 \text{ grams of protein} \times 2 = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

So, John gets 6 grams of protein from 200 grams of mushrooms each day.

Next, to find out how much protein he gets in a week, we multiply the daily amount of protein by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ 6 \text{ grams of protein/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein/week} \]

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms.

"Let's figure out Jerry's current age first. If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up an equation to find his current age.

Let \( J \) be Jerry's current age. Five years ago, Jerry was \( J - 5 \) years old. According to the problem, Jerry's current age is twice his age 5 years ago, so we can write the equation:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve for \( J \):

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work. George needs 2 implants, each costing $2000, so the cost for the implants is:
2 * $2000 = $4000

One of the implants needs a porcelain crown, which costs an extra $500, so we add that to the total:
$4000 + $500 = $4500

George has already paid a deposit of $600, so we subtract that from the total cost:
$4500 - $600 = $3900

Now, we need to find out how many hours George needs to work to earn $3900. He earns $15 per hour, so we divide the total amount needed by his hourly wage:
$3900 / $15 = 260

George needs to work 260 hours.

"Let's call the smallest angle \( x \) degrees. According to the problem:

- One angle is \( x \) degrees.
- Another angle is \( 2x \) degrees (twice the smallest angle).
- The third angle is \( 3x \) degrees (three times the smallest angle).

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} \]
\[ x = 30 \]

The largest angle is \( 3x \):
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

So, the measure of the largest angle is 90 degrees.

"First, let's figure out how much money Colby has in total.

- Quarters: 8 quarters * 25 cents = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes * 10 cents = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels * 5 cents = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add all the amounts together to find the total amount of money Colby has:

200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes for the plane to travel 2000 miles at the same rate it traveled 1200 miles in 3 hours.

First, let's find the speed of the plane:
- The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours.
- Speed = Distance / Time = 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes to travel 2000 miles at this speed:
- Time = Distance / Speed = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours.

So, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles.

"First, let's find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour

Now, let's calculate how many pounds Marissa makes in one hour. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we calculate Marissa's hourly production as follows:

120 pounds * 3/4 = 90 pounds per hour

Now, we know how many pounds each of them can make in one hour. To find out how many pounds they can make together in 12 hours, we multiply their hourly production by 12:

Ruiz: 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds
Marissa: 90 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 1080 pounds

Finally, we add the total pounds of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa together:

720 pounds + 1080 pounds = 1800 pounds

"To find out how much money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings from each part of the day and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- He sold lemonade for 4 hours.
- Each cup was sold for $0.50.

The total number of cups sold in the first four hours is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

The total earnings from the first four hours is:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50 \text{ per cup} = \$30 \]

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- He sold lemonade for 2 hours.
- Each cup was sold for $0.60.

The total number of cups sold in the next two hours is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many rotations the tires will undergo in a month and then calculate how many months (and subsequently years) it will take for the tires to reach their maximum rotation capacity.

1. **Calculate the number of rotations per mile:**
   - Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Therefore, for 1 mile, the tires rotate \( \frac{725}{2} = 362.5 \) times.

2. **Calculate the number of rotations in a month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - So, the number of rotations in a month is \( 400 \times 362.5 = 145,000 \) rotations.

3. **Determine the total number of months before the tire needs to be replaced:**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.
   - The number of months before the tire needs to be replaced is \( \frac{10,440,000}{145,000} = 72 \) months.

4. **Convert months to years:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.

"To find out how much each pump of shampoo costs, we first need to figure out the total number of washes Jackie can get from the bottle if she uses 1 pump per wash. 

The bottle gives 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash, so if Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, she will get twice as many washes from the bottle. 

120 washes * 2 = 240 washes

Now, we need to find the cost per pump. The bottle costs $24.00, and it will now last for 240 washes. 

To find the cost per wash (which is the same as the cost per pump since she uses 1 pump per wash), we divide the total cost by the number of washes:

$24.00 / 240 washes = $0.10 per wash

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.10 to cents:

$0.10 = 10 cents

So, each pump costs 10 cents.

\[ 0.30 \times 60 = 18 \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total original price to find the final price Joe has to pay:
\[ 60 - 18 = 42 \]

Joe has $50, so we subtract the final price from $50 to find out how much money he will have left:
\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

\[ 10 \text{ rows} \times 20 \text{ flowers/row} = 200 \text{ flowers} \]

Next, we need to determine how many of these flowers have bloomed. We know that 4/5 of the planted flowers have bloomed. So, we calculate the number of bloomed flowers as follows:

\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 200 = 160 \]

Therefore, the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden is 160.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb per second to kb per hour.
2. Convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour.

First, we know that there are 3600 seconds in one hour. So, we multiply the speed in kb per second by 3600 to get the speed in kb per hour:
\[ 20 \, \text{kb/second} \times 3600 \, \text{seconds/hour} = 72000 \, \text{kb/hour} \]

Next, we convert kb to Mb. Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we divide the speed in kb per hour by 1000:
\[ 72000 \, \text{kb/hour} \div 1000 = 72 \, \text{Mb/hour} \]

So, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:

"To find the total number of cars towed by the tow truck in a week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first three days and the remaining four days.

1. **First three days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day.
   - Number of cars towed in the first three days = 10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars.

2. **Remaining four days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day compared to the first three days.
   - Number of cars towed each day for the remaining four days = 10 cars/day - 4 cars/day = 6 cars/day.
   - Number of cars towed in the remaining four days = 6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars.

3. **Total number of cars towed in the week:**
   - Total cars = Cars towed in the first three days + Cars towed in the remaining four days
   - Total cars = 30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

1. First, we need to convert the height requirement from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 4 feet is:
   \[
   4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. Adam's current height is 40 inches. We need to find out how many more inches he needs to grow to reach 48 inches:
   \[
   48 \text{ inches} - 40 \text{ inches} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Adam grows 2 inches per year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow 8 inches, we divide the number of inches he needs to grow by the number of inches he grows per year:
   \[
   8 \text{ inches} \div 2 \text{ inches/year} = 4 \text{ years}
   \]

So, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find out how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sales amount.
2. Determine the cost the company paid to acquire the cars.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the acquisition cost from the total sales.
4. Calculate James's commission based on the profit.

Step 1: Calculate the total sales amount.
James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
Total sales = 10 cars * $25,000/car = $250,000

Step 2: Determine the cost the company paid to acquire the cars.
The company paid 30% of the car's price to acquire each car.
Acquisition cost per car = 30% of $25,000 = 0.30 * $25,000 = $7,500
Total acquisition cost for 10 cars = 10 cars * $7,500/car = $75,000

Step 3: Calculate the profit.
Profit = Total sales - Total acquisition cost
Profit = $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

Step 4: Calculate James's commission.
James's commission is 10% of the profit.
James's commission = 10% of $175,000 = 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500

James made $17,500.

"To find out how many men can stay upright on the wave, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of riders who can stay upright.
2. Calculate the number of women who can stay upright.
3. Subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright.
- 25% of 100 riders can stay upright.
- 25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders.

Step 2: Calculate the number of women who can stay upright.
- 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women.
- 60% of 25 = 0.60 * 25 = 15 women.

Step 3: Calculate the number of men who can stay upright.
- Total riders who can stay upright - number of women who can stay upright.
- 25 - 15 = 10 men.

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

"To find the total price for all three jewels, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Price of a diamond Jewell:**
   - Given: $2000

2. **Price of a gold Jewell:**
   - The price of a gold Jewell is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond Jewell.
   - So, the price of a gold Jewell = \(\frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600\)

3. **Price of a silver Jewell:**
   - The cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold Jewell.
   - So, the price of a silver Jewell = \(1600 - 400 = 1200\)

4. **Total price for all three jewels:**
   - Total price = Price of diamond Jewell + Price of gold Jewell + Price of silver Jewell
   - Total price = \(2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800\)

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how long it will take for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob. 

1. First, we find the difference in their speeds:
   - Tom's speed: 70 miles per hour
   - Bob's speed: 55 miles per hour
   - Difference in speed: 70 - 55 = 15 miles per hour

2. This means Tom is gaining 15 miles on Bob every hour.

3. To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up, we divide the distance by the rate at which Tom is gaining on Bob:
   - Distance to catch up: 75 miles
   - Rate of catching up: 15 miles per hour
   - Time to catch up: 75 miles / 15 miles per hour = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class he attends exceeds $10.

1. First, we know the total cost for the classes is $60.
2. Manny's parents will not sign him up again if the cost per class he attends is more than $10.
3. If there are 10 total classes, and he misses some, the number of classes he attends will be less than 10.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny misses as \( x \). Therefore, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class he attends is given by the total cost divided by the number of classes he attends:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the inequality by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Then, we divide both sides by -10 (and remember to reverse the inequality sign):
\[ 4 \geq x \]

This means Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class he attends exceeds $10.

So, the final answer is:
4"

   - Therefore, Julie processes \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) customers per day.

3. **Calculate the combined daily production:**
   - Together, they process \( 50 + 100 = 150 \) customers per day.

4. **Calculate the total weekly production:**
   - They work all 7 days of the week.
   - Therefore, the total weekly production is \( 150 \times 7 = 1050 \) customers.

The total weekly production for the two is 1050."
"To find out how many miles Lynn ran, let's break down the information given:

1. Paisley ran 4 miles.
2. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran. So, Reggie ran \(5 \times 4 = 20\) miles.
3. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. If we let \(L\) represent the number of miles Lynn ran, then Reggie ran \(L + 3\) miles.

Since we know Reggie ran 20 miles, we can set up the equation:
\[ L + 3 = 20 \]

To find \(L\), we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ L = 20 - 3 \]
\[ L = 17 \]

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. **Cost of one apple:**
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - So, one apple costs \( \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of one orange:**
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - So, one orange costs \( \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of 5 apples:**
   - One apple costs $1.30.
   - So, 5 apples cost \( 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \) dollars.

4. **Cost of 5 oranges:**
   - One orange costs $1.10.
   - So, 5 oranges cost \( 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \) dollars.

5. **Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:**
   - Total cost = Cost of 5 apples + Cost of 5 oranges
   - Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

So, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the cost of all the additional features he is getting.

1. **Base price of the truck**: $30,000
2. **King cab upgrade**: $7,500
3. **Leather seats**: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade
   \[
   \text{Cost of leather seats} = \frac{7,500}{3} = 2,500
   \]
4. **Running boards**: $500 less than the leather seats
   \[
   \text{Cost of running boards} = 2,500 - 500 = 2,000
   \]
5. **Upgraded exterior light package**: $1,500

Now, we add all these costs together:

"To find out how much money Tim will make in a year after his promotion, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise.
2. Calculate the bonus he receives, which is half a month's salary based on his new salary.
3. Calculate his total annual salary, including the bonus.

**Step 1: Calculate the new monthly salary.**

Tim's original monthly salary is $20,000. A 5% raise on this salary is calculated as:
\[ 20,000 \times 0.05 = 1,000 \]

So, his new monthly salary is:
\[ 20,000 + 1,000 = 21,000 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the bonus.**

The bonus is half a month's salary based on his new salary:
\[ 21,000 \times 0.5 = 10,500 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total annual salary.**

Tim's annual salary without the bonus is:
\[ 21,000 \times 12 = 252,000 \]

Adding the bonus to his annual salary:
\[ 252,000 + 10,500 = 262,500 \]

So, Tim will make $262,500 in a year.

"To find out how much it cost James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to add up all his expenses. 

1. **Cost of the plane**: $150,000
2. **Monthly hanger rent**: $5,000
3. **Monthly fuel cost**: Twice the hanger rent, so $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Next, we calculate the total monthly maintenance cost:
- Hanger rent + Fuel cost = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month

Now, we find the total maintenance cost for the year:
- $15,000 per month * 12 months = $180,000

Finally, we add the cost of the plane to the total maintenance cost for the year:
- Cost of the plane + Total maintenance cost = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

So, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is:
330000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cooking time for rice**: Finley took 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. **Cooking time for pork**: It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. So, the cooking time for pork is:
   \[
   30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. **Cooking time for beans**: Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. First, we find the combined cooking time of pork and rice:
   \[
   30 + 50 = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Then, the cooking time for beans is:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Total cooking time**: To find the total time it took to cook all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:
   \[
   30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]

So, the total time it took to cook all the food is:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

1. Each animal has one head.
2. Sheep have 4 legs.
3. Geese have 2 legs.

Let's define:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads (animals) is 20.
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]
2. The total number of legs is 70.
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   \[
   2S + G = 35
   \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To solve for \( S \) and \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
   \[
   (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
   \]
   \[
   2S + G - S - G = 15
   \]
   \[
   S = 15
   \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

"To find out how much the apple pie cost, we need to add up the cost of the items Gus bought and then subtract that total from the $20.00 he spent.

The cost of the 2 bags of chips is:
2 bags * $2.00/bag = $4.00

The cost of the bucket of fried chicken is:
$8.00

The cost of the bottle of soda is:
$1.00

Now, we add up the costs of these items:
$4.00 (chips) + $8.00 (chicken) + $1.00 (soda) = $13.00

Next, we subtract this total from the $20.00 Gus spent to find the cost of the apple pie:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00.

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - Newspapers to District A - Newspapers to District C
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 198 - 209
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how much money Kassidy has:**
   - Aurelia has $120.
   - Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia.
   - So, Kassidy's money = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \) dollars.

2. **Determine how much money Rayna has:**
   - Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy.
   - So, Rayna's money = 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money they have together:**
   - Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
   - Total money = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

4. **Determine how much each person would have if they shared the total money equally:**
   - Number of people = 3
   - Money per person = Total money / Number of people
   - Money per person = 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.

So, each person would have 120 dollars.

"To find out how much change Adam got, we need to calculate the total cost of the candies he bought and then subtract that from the $15 he paid.

First, let's calculate the cost of the candies of type A:
- Adam bought 7 candies of type A.
- Each candy of type A costs $0.5.
- So, the total cost for type A candies is \( 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the candies of type B:
- Adam bought 10 candies of type B.
- Each candy of type B costs $0.75.
- So, the total cost for type B candies is \( 10 \times 0.75 = 7.5 \) dollars.

Now, let's find the total cost of all the candies:
- Total cost = cost of type A candies + cost of type B candies
- Total cost = \( 3.5 + 7.5 = 11 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Days in the Month**: 30 days.
2. **Good Days in the First 30 Days**: 12 days.
3. **Bad Days in the First 30 Days**: 8 days.
4. **Neutral Days in the First 30 Days**: The rest of the days, which is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

Next, we need to consider the next three days:
- The next three days are good, neutral, and good.

So, we add these to the counts:
- **Good Days**: 12 (initial) + 2 (next three days) = 14 days.
- **Neutral Days**: 10 (initial) + 1 (next three days) = 11 days.
- **Bad Days**: 8 (initial) + 0 (next three days) = 8 days.

Now, we need to find out how many good days are left in the month. Since the month has 30 days, and we have already accounted for 33 days (30 initial + 3 next days), we need to consider only the first 30 days for the final count.

The number of good days in the first 30 days is 12.

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:

"To find out how many books Sally has, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's say the number of books Sally has is \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ \text{Janey's books} = 2S + 3 \]

We know Janey has 21 books, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To solve for \( S \), we first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{18}{2} = S \]
\[ 9 = S \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. James buys 8 toys to have enough for the 12 dogs, so he now has 4 (original) + 8 (new) = 12 toys.
4. When James returns, there are twice as many dogs as when he left. So, 12 dogs * 2 = 24 dogs.
5. James needs to buy more toys for the additional 12 dogs (24 - 12 = 12 more dogs), so he buys 12 more toys, making the total 12 (current) + 12 (new) = 24 toys.
6. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs toys for those 3 dogs. The number of dogs is now 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.
7. James needs 21 toys in total for the 21 dogs.

3. Calculate Frances's investment from the remaining amount.
4. Calculate the remaining amount after Frances's investment, which is Skyler's investment.

Let's start with Dylan's investment:
- Dylan invested \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount.
- Total amount = $1200.
- Dylan's investment = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480 \).

Next, we calculate the remaining amount after Dylan's investment:
- Remaining amount = Total amount - Dylan's investment.
- Remaining amount = 1200 - 480 = 720.

Now, we calculate Frances's investment:
- Frances invested \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining amount.
- Frances's investment = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480 \).

Finally, we calculate the remaining amount after Frances's investment, which is Skyler's investment:
- Skyler's investment = Remaining amount - Frances's investment.
- Skyler's investment = 720 - 480 = 240.

So, Skyler's investment is $240.

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to work backwards from the final length. The final length of the dress is 140 cm, which includes a 20 cm lace trim added to the bottom. 

First, we subtract the 20 cm lace trim from the final length to find the length of the dress before the trim was added:
\[ 140 \text{ cm} - 20 \text{ cm} = 120 \text{ cm} \]

This 120 cm is the length of the dress after it was extended by 50% of its original length. Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \). The extended length is 150% of the original length, which can be written as:
\[ 1.5x = 120 \text{ cm} \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = \frac{120 \text{ cm}}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 80 \text{ cm} \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"First, let's find out the cost of the candies. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so five lollipops cost:

5 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the four candies:

$3.20 total - $2.00 for lollipops = $1.20 for four candies

To find the cost of one candy, we divide the total cost of the candies by the number of candies:

$1.20 / 4 candies = $0.30 per candy

Now we know the cost of one lollipop is $0.40 and the cost of one candy is $0.30. To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we calculate:

10 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $4.00
10 candies * $0.30 per candy = $3.00

Adding these together gives us the total cost:

$4.00 for lollipops + $3.00 for candies = $7.00

So, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost Manolo $7.00.

"First, let's figure out the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20. So, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find out the total bill. We know the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill \( T \). The cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.60 \times T \]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60T \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract \( 0.60T \) from both sides:
\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

1. **Cost of bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Cost of apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Cost of oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as one banana.
   - One banana costs $1, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

Now, we add the costs of all the fruits together to get the total cost of the crate:
\[ 5 + 6 + 21 = 32 \]

"To find out how many square feet Brittany's comforter is, we need to calculate the total number of 1-foot by 1-foot squares of each color and then add them all together.

1. **Red squares**: There are 14 red squares.
2. **Blue squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares. So, the number of blue squares is:
   \[
   14 + 4 = 18
   \]
3. **Green squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares. So, the number of green squares is:
   \[

"First, let's figure out how many chairs are needed in total. There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so we need chairs for all of them:
\[ 42 \text{ (adults)} + 15 \text{ (babies)} = 57 \text{ chairs} \]

Next, we know the restaurant has 8 high chairs. Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ regular chairs} \]

Now, let's add the high chairs and regular chairs to find out how many chairs the restaurant already has:
\[ 8 \text{ (high chairs)} + 40 \text{ (regular chairs)} = 48 \text{ chairs} \]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the number of chairs the restaurant already has from the total number of chairs needed:
\[ 57 \text{ (total chairs needed)} - 48 \text{ (chairs available)} = 9 \text{ more chairs} \]

   \[
   50 \times 0.30 = 15
   \]
   \[
   50 + 15 = 65
   \]
   So, Betty has 65 points.
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty:
   \[
   65 - 30 = 35
   \]
   So, Tom has 35 points.
4. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom:
   \[

"To find out how many chairs the restaurant has left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

First, let's calculate the total number of chairs:
- Normal chairs: 170
- Baby chairs: 23

Total chairs = 170 + 23 = 193

Next, we subtract the chairs that were sent for repair:
- Normal chairs sent for repair: 20
- Baby chairs sent for repair: 13

Total chairs sent for repair = 20 + 13 = 33

Now, subtract the total chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs:
193 - 33 = 160

So, the restaurant has 160 chairs left.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of pizzas**: Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza, so there are 5 pizzas in total.

2. **Slices per pizza**: Each pizza has 12 slices.

3. **Total slices of pizza**: 
   \[
   5 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices per pizza} = 60 \text{ slices}
   \]

4. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends**:
   - Bryce and two friends ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas.
   - Number of pizzas eaten by Bryce and two friends: 3 pizzas.
   - Slices eaten per pizza: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \) slices.
   - Total slices eaten by Bryce and two friends: 
     \[
     3 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 24 \text{ slices}
     \]

5. **Slices eaten by the remaining two friends**:
   - The remaining two friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas.
   - Number of pizzas eaten by the remaining two friends: 2 pizzas.
   - Slices eaten per pizza: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \) slices.
   - Total slices eaten by the remaining two friends: 
     \[
     2 \text{ pizzas} \times 9 \text{ slices per pizza} = 18 \text{ slices}
     \]

6. **Total slices eaten**:
   \[
   24 \text{ slices} + 18 \text{ slices} = 42 \text{ slices}
   \]

7. **Slices left**:
   \[
   60 \text{ slices} - 42 \text{ slices} = 18 \text{ slices}
   \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:

"First, let's find out how long it takes the dog to eat nine sausages. The dog eats the sausages in 2/3 the time it takes the cat. The cat takes 30 minutes, so:

Time for the dog = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \) minutes
Time for the dog = 20 minutes

Now, we need to find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is calculated by adding the times together and dividing by 2:

Average time = \( \frac{30 + 20}{2} \) minutes
Average time = \( \frac{50}{2} \) minutes
Average time = 25 minutes

"First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches.

Topher's shoe length in inches:
8 feet * 12 inches/foot + 4 inches = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

Now, we know that Topher's shoe length is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's use \( B \) to represent the length of Bobby's shoe in inches.

The equation based on the problem statement is:
\[ 100 = 9B + 10 \]

To find \( B \), we need to solve for \( B \):
\[ 100 - 10 = 9B \]
\[ 90 = 9B \]
\[ B = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ B = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is 10 inches.

"To find out how many windows Hannah smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each car has 4 windows.
- Total windows in students' cars = 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.

Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows:
- Windows smashed in students' cars = 1/4 * 256 windows = 64 windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each car has 2 windows.
- Total windows in teachers' cars = 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.

Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows:
- Windows smashed in teachers' cars = 3/4 * 64 windows = 48 windows.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 windows (students) + 48 windows (teachers) = 112 windows.

"To find out what percent of Candy's spools are blue, we first need to find the total number of spools and the total number of blue spools.

The total number of blue spools is the sum of the light blue and dark blue spools:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60 blue spools

Next, we find the total number of spools by adding all the spools together:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150 spools

Now, to find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = 0.4 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = 40\% \]

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many people had voted by midday.
2. Calculate the number of people who had not voted by midday.
3. Find out how many of the remaining people voted by 16:00.
4. Calculate the number of people who had not voted by 16:00.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Determine how many people had voted by midday:**
   - Total number of people = 5000
   - Fraction of people who voted by midday = 2/5
   - Number of people who voted by midday = 2/5 * 5000 = 2000

2. **Calculate the number of people who had not voted by midday:**
   - Number of people who had not voted by midday = Total number of people - Number of people who voted by midday
   - Number of people who had not voted by midday = 5000 - 2000 = 3000

3. **Find out how many of the remaining people voted by 16:00:**
   - Fraction of the remaining people who voted by 16:00 = 2/3
   - Number of people who voted by 16:00 from the remaining = 2/3 * 3000 = 2000

4. **Calculate the number of people who had not voted by 16:00:**
   - Number of people who had not voted by 16:00 = Number of people who had not voted by midday - Number of people who voted by 16:00
   - Number of people who had not voted by 16:00 = 3000 - 2000 = 1000

So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000.

"First, let's find out Dora's father's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, and her father's age is eight more than twice her age, we can calculate it as follows:

Dora's father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
Dora's father's age = 30 + 8
Dora's father's age = 38

Next, we find out Dora's mother's age. Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, so:

Dora's mother's age = Dora's father's age - 4
Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4
Dora's mother's age = 34

Now, we can calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:

Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

"To find out how many votes candidate C got, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of votes candidate A received.
2. Determine the number of votes candidate B received, which is 50% more than candidate A's votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes received by candidates A and B.
4. Subtract the total votes of A and B from the total number of votes to find out how many votes candidate C received.

Let's start with step 1:
- Candidate A received 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, candidate A received \( 20\% \times 100 = 20 \) votes.

Next, step 2:
- Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A. So, candidate B received \( 20 + (50\% \times 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 \) votes.

Now, step 3:
- The total number of votes received by candidates A and B is \( 20 + 30 = 50 \) votes.

Finally, step 4:
- The total number of votes is 100. Therefore, the number of votes candidate C received is \( 100 - 50 = 50 \) votes.

"First, let's figure out how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we can calculate Beck's apples as follows:

100 apples (Boris) - 23 apples = 77 apples (Beck)

Now, if Boris gives Beck 10 apples, we need to adjust the number of apples each has:

Boris: 100 apples - 10 apples = 90 apples
Beck: 77 apples + 10 apples = 87 apples

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after the exchange:

90 apples (Boris) - 87 apples (Beck) = 3 apples

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now.

"First, let's figure out how many small stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons. She starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them:

30 small stickers * 90% = 27 small stickers

Since a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets:

27 small stickers / 3 small stickers per large button = 9 large buttons

Next, let's determine how many large stickers she trades for large buttons. She starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them:

40 large stickers * 50% = 20 large stickers

Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets:

20 large stickers = 20 large buttons

Now, she has 20 large stickers left to trade for small buttons. Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so:

20 large stickers * 3 small buttons per large sticker = 60 small buttons

Now, let's add up all the buttons she has. She has 9 large buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading the remaining large stickers. Since each large button is worth three small buttons, we can convert all her large buttons to small buttons to find the total:

9 large buttons * 3 small buttons per large button = 27 small buttons
20 large buttons * 3 small buttons per large button = 60 small buttons

Adding all the small buttons together:

27 small buttons + 60 small buttons + 60 small buttons = 147 small buttons

So, Lorraine has 147 buttons by the end.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of votes against the new regulation.
2. According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against. So, the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \).
3. The total number of people on the council is 33, so the total number of votes is 33.
4. Therefore, the equation representing the total votes is:
   \[
   x + 2x = 33
   \]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   3x = 33
   \]
6. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{33}{3} = 11
   \]
7. The number of votes in favor is \( 2x \):
   \[
   2 \times 11 = 22
   \]

So, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To find out how many shirts Krissa needs to order, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.
   - Number of small shirts = 2 * 11 = 22

3. **Medium shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of medium shirts = 22 - 4 = 18

4. **Large shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of large shirts = 18 / 2 = 9

5. **Extra-large shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of extra-large shirts = 9 + 6 = 15

Now, let's add up all the shirts:

- Extra-small: 11
- Small: 22
- Medium: 18
- Large: 9
- Extra-large: 15

Total number of shirts = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).
2. According to the problem, the first house needs half the number of cases as the second house. So, the second house needs \( 2x \) cases.
3. The third house needs double the number of cases as the first house. So, the third house needs \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

So, the first house needs 50 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Fish Count:**
   - Bob initially had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.

2. **Fish Bought:**
   - Bob bought 17 more fish from the pet store. Let's denote the number of orange fish he bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( W \).

3. **Total Fish After Purchase:**
   - After buying the fish, the total number of orange fish Bob has is \( 3 + O \).
   - The total number of white fish Bob has is \( 4 + W \).

4. **Condition Given:**
   - Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be written as:
     \[
     3 + O = 2(4 + W)
     \]

5. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Expand and simplify the equation:
     \[
     3 + O = 8 + 2W
     \]
   - Rearrange to isolate \( O \):
     \[
     O = 8 + 2W - 3
     \]
     \[
     O = 5 + 2W
     \]

6. **Total Fish Bought:**
   - We know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17:
     \[
     O + W = 17
     \]

7. **Substitute \( O \) in the Total Fish Equation:**
   - Substitute \( O = 5 + 2W \) into \( O + W = 17 \):
     \[
     5 + 2W + W = 17
     \]
     \[
     5 + 3W = 17

     3W = 12
     \]
     \[
     W = 4
     \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy drives to work and back home each day.
2. Multiply the daily distance by the number of workdays in a week to get the total weekly distance.
3. Determine how many gallons of gas Andy uses per week by dividing the total weekly distance by the car's fuel efficiency.
4. Calculate the total cost of the gas used per week by multiplying the gallons of gas used per week by the price per gallon.

Let's do the calculations:

1. One-way distance to work is 5 miles, so the round trip (to work and back home) is:
   \( 5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles/day} \)

2. Andy works from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days a week, so the total weekly distance is:
   \( 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \)

3. Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon, so the gallons of gas used per week is:
   \( \frac{50 \text{ miles/week}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \)

4. The price of gas is $3 per gallon, so the total cost of gas per week is:

"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the total number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.
- So, the total number of tomatoes is \(22 \times 5 = 110\).

Next, we calculate the total number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.
- So, the total number of eggplants is \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:
- Total fruits = Total tomatoes + Total eggplants
- Total fruits = 110 + 32 = 142

"To find out how many OLED TVs Samwell's store sold, we first need to figure out how many smart TVs and analog TVs were sold, and then subtract that number from the total number of TVs sold.

1. Calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
   - One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
   - \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 40 TVs = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \) smart TVs.

2. Calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
   - One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.
   - \( \frac{1}{8} \) of 40 TVs = \( \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \) analog TVs.

3. Calculate the number of OLED TVs sold:
   - The rest of the TVs sold are OLED TVs.
   - Total TVs sold = 40
   - Number of OLED TVs = Total TVs - (Number of smart TVs + Number of analog TVs)
   - Number of OLED TVs = 40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25.

"First, we need to find out how many groups were formed. Since 90 people were split into 9-person groups, we divide 90 by 9:

90 / 9 = 10 groups

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups had members bring back seashells. Since 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells, we calculate:

3/5 * 10 = 6 groups

Each member of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells. Since each group has 9 members, the total number of seashells brought back by one group is:

9 * 2 = 18 seashells

To find the total number of seashells brought back by all 6 groups, we multiply the number of seashells one group brought by the number of groups:

18 * 6 = 108 seashells

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.
3. Multiply the total monthly salary by the number of months to get the total amount paid over three months.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of employees after three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. Over three months, the number of new employees hired is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

Adding these to the initial 200 employees:
\[ 200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.**

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. For 260 employees, the total monthly salary is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1,040,000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount paid over three months.**

The total amount paid over three months is:
\[ 1,040,000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3,120,000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:

"To find out how long the choir will be caroling, we need to add up the time for all the songs they plan to sing. 

First, we calculate the total time for singing ""Deck the Halls"" twice:
- ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long.
- They will sing it twice, so \(150 \text{ seconds} \times 2 = 300 \text{ seconds}\).

Next, we add the time for singing ""Jingle Bells"" once:
- ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long.
- They will sing it once, so it's just 240 seconds.

Now, we add the total time for ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Jingle Bells"":
- \(300 \text{ seconds} + 240 \text{ seconds} = 540 \text{ seconds}\).

So, the total time the choir will be caroling is 540 seconds.

"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together gives:
3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals.

Let's say Bubbles buys \( x \) stuffed goats. After buying the goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. This can be written as:
\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides by \( 14 + x \):
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Subtract 0.30x from both sides to isolate \( x \):
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Divide both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

   - Since \( s = 2z \), the amount of salt is \( 2z \) ounces.
   - The amount of sugar is also \( 2z \) ounces.
   - The amount of oil is \( 2s = 2(2z) = 4z \) ounces.

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces.
   - Therefore, the sum of all the ingredients is:
     \[
     z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     10z = 10
     \]

4. **Solve for \( z \):**
   - Divide both sides by 10:
     \[
     z = 1
     \]

5. **Find the Amount of Oil:**
   - The amount of oil is \( 4z \):
     \[
     4z = 4 \times 1 = 4
     \]

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

1. **Cost of goats:**
   - John buys 3 goats.
   - Each goat costs $500.
   - Total cost for goats = 3 goats * $500/goat = $1500.

2. **Cost of cows:**
   - John buys 2 cows.
   - Each cow costs $1500.
   - Total cost for cows = 2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000.

3. **Total amount spent:**
   - Total cost for goats + Total cost for cows = $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

So, John spent a total of $4500.

"First, let's find out how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we calculate 20% of 40:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving away some. Initially, he had 40 cars, he sold 8, and gave away 16:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, Joe remains with 16 cars.

"To find out how much each student raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount raised by the students.
2. Divide this amount by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

First, we know the total amount raised for the charity is $175,000. Out of this, $50,000 comes from organizations. So, the amount raised by the students is:
\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we divide the amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised:
\[ 125,000 \div 20 = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250.

"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the time Sandy walked on the second day.
2. Add the time from both days together.
3. Convert the total time from hours to minutes.

First, we know that Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. So, we calculate the time for the second day:

\[ \text{Time on the second day} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we add the time from both days together:

\[ \text{Total time in hours} = 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we convert the total time from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour:

\[ \text{Total time in minutes} = 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

"Let's use algebra to solve this problem. We'll use variables to represent the number of cards each person has.

Let \( P \) be the number of cards PJ has.
Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.
Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, Becca has 153 cards.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how high each person can lift a mountain, starting from Pompei and working our way up to Naruto.

1. **Pompei's lifting height:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting height:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - So, Saskay can lift a mountain \( 12 \times 1 \) inch = 12 inches.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting height:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - So, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \( 4 \times 12 \) inches = 48 inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting height:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - So, Naruto can lift a mountain \( 10 \times 48 \) inches = 480 inches.

5. **Convert inches to feet:**

"To find out how many miles Mason has traveled in total, we need to calculate the distance he covered in each part of his journey and then add them together.

First, we calculate the distance he traveled in the first part of his journey:
- Mason's speed is 8 miles per hour.
- He travels for 4 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles.

Next, we calculate the distance he traveled in the second part of his journey:
- Mason's speed remains 8 miles per hour.
- He travels for another 6 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles.

Now, we add the distances from both parts of the journey to find the total distance:
- Total distance = Distance in the first part + Distance in the second part = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles.

So, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can assume that the total distance is the same for all animals.
   - The speed of the kangaroos can be calculated as the total distance divided by the total time. However, since we don't know the exact distance, we can use the concept of relative speed and time.

2. **Calculate the time it would take one kangaroo:**
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours, then one kangaroo would take 3 times as long because the same distance is covered by one kangaroo instead of three.
   - Time for one kangaroo = 18 hours * 3 = 54 hours.

3. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.
   - If one kangaroo takes 54 hours, a turtle, traveling at half the speed, would take twice as long.
   - Time for one turtle = 54 hours * 2 = 108 hours.

4. **Calculate the time it would take four turtles:**
   - If one turtle takes 108 hours, four turtles would take one-fourth of that time because they are traveling together.
   - Time for four turtles = 108 hours / 4 = 27 hours.

So, it will take four turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

2. **Calculate the simple interest (SI):**
   - Simple Interest (SI) = \( P \times R \times T \)
   - Here, \( R \) is already in dollars per year, so we can directly use it.
   - SI = \( 300 \times 225 \times 3 \)

3. **Calculate the total amount (A):**
   - Total Amount (A) = Principal (P) + Simple Interest (SI)
   - A = \( 300 + (300 \times 225 \times 3) \)

4. **Perform the calculations:**
   - SI = \( 300 \times 225 \times 3 = 202500 \)
   - A = \( 300 + 202500 = 202800 \)

So, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $202,800.

"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount of money he spends on shoes each year by the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year.

First, we know that James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month. There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we know that James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, James pays on average $110 for each pair of shoes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of Green Food Baskets:**
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
   - Total cost for green food baskets = 3 × $25 = $75.

2. **Cost of Red Food Baskets:**
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
   - Total cost for red food baskets before discount = 3 × $18 = $54.
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food.
   - Total discount for red food baskets = 3 × $2 = $6.
   - Total cost for red food baskets after discount = $54 - $6 = $48.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost for all baskets = Cost of green food baskets + Cost of red food baskets after discount.
   - Total cost = $75 + $48 = $123.

So, the total amount you will have to pay is:

"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we can follow these steps:

1. First, determine how many rooms are in one-half of the motel:
   \[
   \text{Total rooms} = 90
   \]
   \[
   \text{Half of the rooms} = \frac{90}{2} = 45
   \]

2. Next, calculate the total time it takes to clean 45 rooms, knowing that it takes 20 minutes to clean each room:
   \[
   \text{Time to clean one room} = 20 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time to clean 45 rooms} = 45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours:
   \[
   \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 15 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Year**: The town will build 12 homes.
2. **Second Year**: They will build three times as many homes as in the first year. 
   - Three times 12 homes is \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) homes.
3. **Third Year**: They will count the total number of homes built in the first two years and then double that amount.
   - Total homes built in the first two years: \( 12 + 36 = 48 \) homes.
   - Doubling this amount: \( 2 \times 48 = 96 \) homes.

Now, let's add up all the homes built over the three years:
- First year: 12 homes
- Second year: 36 homes
- Third year: 96 homes

Total homes built: \( 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 \)

"Let's use some algebra to solve this problem. Let's say:

- My age is \( x \).
- My brother's age is \( x + 3 \) (since I am three years younger than my brother).
- My sister's age is \( x - 2 \) (since I am two years older than my sister).
- My mom's age is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \) (since my mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age).

The sum of all our ages is 87, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + [3(x + 3) - 1] = 87 \]

Now, let's simplify and solve for \( x \):

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]
\[ 6x = 78 \]
\[ x = 13 \]

So, I am 13 years old.

"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required for all the students.

1. Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed:
   - There are 27 students, and each student needs 2 glue sticks.
   - Total glue sticks needed = 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.

2. Determine how many packs are needed:
   - Each pack contains 8 glue sticks.
   - To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack.
   - 54 glue sticks ÷ 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs.

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the next whole number to ensure he has enough glue sticks for all the students.

3. Round up to the nearest whole number:
   - 6.75 packs rounded up = 7 packs.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"First, let's calculate how much money Rafaela received in tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we multiply 40 by 20:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to find out how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \times 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

So, Julieta received $80 less than Rafaela. Therefore, Julieta's total tips are:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of tips both Rafaela and Julieta received, we add their individual amounts:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

So, the total amount of tips they received together is:

"Let's use algebra to solve this problem. We'll assign variables to the number of books each person has:

- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has \( F - 12 \) books.
- Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 \) books, which simplifies to \( F + 13 \) books.

We know that together they have 85 books, so we can write the equation:
\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Now, let's combine like terms:
\[ F + F - 12 + F + 13 = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Next, we solve for \( F \):

"First, let's figure out how much money Sarah will make from selling her rope. The rope is 20 meters long, and her friend is buying it for $2 a meter. So, the total amount Sarah will get is:

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Next, we need to determine how much of this money Sarah will spend on a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter. If she buys a new rope that is also 20 meters long, the cost will be:

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30 \]

Now, to find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money she made from selling her old rope:

\[ \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \]

So, Sarah will have \$10 left over.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Melanie's current age:**
   - We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old.
   - So, her current age is \( 18 - 10 = 8 \) years old.

2. **Set up the equation for when her age will be three times her current age:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be three times her current age.
   - In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be \( 8 + x \).
   - We want this age to be three times her current age, which is \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \).

3. **Write the equation and solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   8 + x = 24
   \]
   \[
   x = 24 - 8
   \]
   \[
   x = 16
   \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"First, let's figure out the cost of each item Kelly is buying:

- The total cost for 5 packs of bacon is $10, so each pack of bacon costs $10 / 5 = $2.
- Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet of chicken costs $2 * 2 = $4.
- Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
- Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of item:

- The total cost for the 6 packets of chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.
- The total cost for the 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.
- The total cost for the 7 packs of apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up all the costs:

- The total cost for the bacon is $10.
- The total cost for the chicken is $24.
- The total cost for the strawberries is $12.
- The total cost for the apples is $14.

The total cost for all items is $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Kelly’s budget is $65, so the amount of money she has left is $65 - $60 = $5.

"To find out how long Elaina's usual concerts run, we need to first understand the total time of the final concert and how it was structured.

1. The final concert is 65 minutes long.
2. This includes a 15-minute encore.
3. The main part of the final concert is therefore \(65 - 15 = 50\) minutes.
4. The main part of the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts.

Let's denote the length of her usual concerts as \(x\). According to the problem, the main part of the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so:
\[ 2x = 50 \]

To find \(x\), we solve the equation:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

"Argo starts with 200 toys. He gives away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. To find out how many toys Argo has left, we subtract the total number of toys he gave away from the number of toys he started with.

First, we add up the toys given away:
40 (to Alyssa) + 80 (to Bonnie) + 30 (to Nicky) = 150 toys

Next, we subtract this total from the original number of toys:
200 (original toys) - 150 (toys given away) = 50 toys

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of a thingamabob.
2. Use the speed of a thingamabob to find the speed of a whirligig.

First, we know that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob and that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. So, we can find the speed of a thingamabob by dividing the speed of a whatchamacallit by 11.

\[ \text{Speed of a thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. So, we multiply the speed of a thingamabob by 5 to find the speed of a whirligig.

\[ \text{Speed of a whirligig} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

So, the speed of a whirligig is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the payments for mowing lawns:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn.
   - Let's assume Tasha mowed Joe's lawn \( x \) times.

2. **Calculate the payments for mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns:**
   - Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
   - Tasha mowed Alba's lawn 5 times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

3. **Determine the total payment for mowing lawns:**
   - Joe's payment: \( 6x \) dollars.
   - Kamala's payment: \( 6 \times 3x = 18x \) dollars.
   - Alba's payment: \( 6 \times 5x = 30x \) dollars.
   - Total payment for mowing lawns: \( 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x \) dollars.

4. **Set up the equation for total earnings:**
   - Tasha's total earnings from all activities (lemonade sales and mowing lawns) is $80.
   - Let \( L \) be the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales.
   - Therefore, \( L + 54x = 80 \).

5. **Determine the value of \( x \):**
   - Since Joe paid Tasha $6, and we need to find out how many times she mowed his lawn, we need to find \( x \).
   - We know that \( 54x \) is the total amount earned from mowing lawns.
   - To find \( x \), we need to solve \( 54x \leq 80 \) and \( 54x \) should be a multiple of 6 (since Joe paid $6 per mow).

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( 54x = 54 \) (since \( 54 \) is the largest multiple of 6 that is less than or equal to 80).
   - \( x = 1 \).

7. **Calculate the total payment for mowing lawns:**
   - \( 54x = 54 \times 1 = 54 \) dollars.

8. **Calculate the amount made from lemonade sales:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total capacity of the pot in terms of bowls:**
   - The pot can hold enough soup to fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.

2. **Convert the pot's capacity to a common unit:**
   - Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls (because 4 adult bowls = 8 child bowls), we can say that 1 adult bowl = 2 child bowls.

3. **Calculate the total number of bowls needed for dinner:**
   - Calvin (1 adult) + his wife (1 adult) + 2 children = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 people.
   - Each adult will eat 1 adult bowl, and each child will eat 1 child bowl.
   - Total bowls needed: 2 adult bowls + 2 child bowls.

4. **Convert the total bowls needed to child bowls:**
   - 2 adult bowls = 2 * 2 = 4 child bowls.
   - 2 child bowls = 2 child bowls.
   - Total bowls needed in child bowls: 4 + 2 = 6 child bowls.

5. **Determine the leftover soup:**
   - The pot holds 8 child bowls.
   - 6 child bowls are used for dinner.
   - Leftover soup: 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls.

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the material required for the small masks and the large masks separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- To find out how much material is needed for 1 small mask, we divide 2 yards by 4 masks: \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, we multiply the material needed for 1 small mask by 20: \( 0.5 \text{ yards/mask} \times 20 \text{ masks} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- To find out how much material is needed for 1 large mask, we divide 2.25 yards by 3 masks: \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, we multiply the material needed for 1 large mask by 8: \( 0.75 \text{ yards/mask} \times 8 \text{ masks} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

   - Bologna thrown at red balloons: 40 pieces.
   - Bologna thrown at yellow balloons: \( 58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces at red balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces of bologna} \).

3. **Calculate the number of yellow balloons:**
   - Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons.
   - Total bologna thrown at yellow balloons: \( 3y = 18 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   - \( 3y = 18 \)
   - \( y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).

So, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is 6.

"To find out how many tune-ups Jon's car needs in a 30-day month, we first need to calculate the total miles Jon drives in that month.

Jon drives 100 miles a day. In a 30-day month, he drives:
100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. To find out how many tune-ups he needs for 3000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the miles per tune-up:
3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Bruce works for 5 hours on Tuesday.
2. On Wednesday, he works twice the time he worked on Tuesday. So, he works \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours on Wednesday.
3. On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than he worked on Wednesday. So, he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours on Thursday.

Now, let's add up the hours he worked over the three days:
- Tuesday: 5 hours
- Wednesday: 10 hours
- Thursday: 8 hours

Total hours worked = \(5 + 10 + 8 = 23\)

"To find out how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they both received the same amount of allowance.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons. 
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Now, add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they both received the same amount:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"To find out how much money the class was able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Step 1: Total number of lollipops sold
- Each student sold 10 lollipops.
- There are 30 students.
- Total lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops

Step 2: Total revenue from selling the lollipops
- Each lollipop was sold for $0.8.
- Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240

Step 3: Total cost of buying the lollipops
- Each lollipop cost $0.5 to buy.
- Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150

Step 4: Calculate the profit
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
- Profit = $240 - $150 = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

"To find out how many pets Larry has, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Cats**: Larry has 3 cats.
2. **Dogs**: He has 3 times as many dogs as cats. So, the number of dogs is:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dogs}
   \]
3. **Rabbits**: He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. So, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   9 - 2 = 7 \text{ rabbits}
   \]
4. **Fish**: He has three times the number of fish as rabbits. So, the number of fish is:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ fish}
   \]
5. **Gerbils**: He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. So, the number of gerbils is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ gerbils}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the pets:
\[
3 \text{ (cats)} + 9 \text{ (dogs)} + 7 \text{ (rabbits)} + 21 \text{ (fish)} + 7 \text{ (gerbils)} = 47

"First, let's figure out how many slices of bread Josh can eat in a day. Since Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, and Abby can eat 2 slices a day, Josh can eat:

2 slices/day * 2 = 4 slices/day

Now, let's add the number of slices Abby and Josh eat together in one day:

2 slices/day (Abby) + 4 slices/day (Josh) = 6 slices/day (total)

The loaf of bread has 24 slices, so to find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat together in one day:

24 slices / 6 slices/day = 4 days

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of cups**: Lana has 27 cups.
2. **Cups used for cinnamon tea**: She uses 15 cups for cinnamon tea.
3. **Cups left for chamomile and mint tea**: 
   \[
   27 - 15 = 12 \text{ cups}
   \]
4. **Cups in each row**: She divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, so each row has:
   \[
   \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups}
   \]
5. **Cups of chamomile and mint tea in each row**: Since each row has 9 cups and the remaining 12 cups are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea, we need to find out how many of these 12 cups are in each row. Each row has 9 cups, and 3 of these are cinnamon tea (since 15 cups of cinnamon tea are divided into 3 rows):
   \[
   \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ cups of cinnamon tea per row}
   \]
   Therefore, the remaining cups in each row are:
   \[
   9 - 5 = 4 \text{ cups}
   \]
6. **Cups of chamomile and mint tea in each row**: These 4 cups are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea:

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours and then determine how many berries he needs to pick up per trip to reach a total of 24 berries.

1. First, we know that one trip (down, pick berries, and back up) takes 4 hours.
2. In 8 hours, the sloth can make:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
   \]
3. The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in total. If he makes 2 trips, he needs to pick up:
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}

"First, we need to find out how much water Anthony and his father put into the tank. They filled the tank with half the amount of water in the pool. Since the pool has 10,000 gallons of water, half of that is:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so in 6 days, the total amount of water used is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find out how much water is left after 6 days:

\[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

"To find out how many calories the pastries Andrew baked have, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the calories in a mini cinnamon roll.
2. Calculate the calories in a mini blueberry muffin.
3. Multiply the calories of a mini cinnamon roll by the number of mini cinnamon rolls.
4. Multiply the calories of a mini blueberry muffin by the number of mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

First, let's calculate the calories in a mini cinnamon roll:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- So, a mini cinnamon roll has \(600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200\) calories.

Next, let's calculate the calories in a mini blueberry muffin:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- So, a mini blueberry muffin has \(450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150\) calories.

Now, let's find the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls:
- Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
- Each mini cinnamon roll has 200 calories.
- So, the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \(200 \times 200 = 40,000\) calories.

Next, let's find the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins:
- Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
- Each mini blueberry muffin has 150 calories.
- So, the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \(300 \times 150 = 45,000\) calories.

Finally, let's add the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins:
- The total calories from the pastries are \(40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000\) calories.

"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance the bus traveled:
- The bus travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour.
- It travels for 5 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance the car traveled:
- The car travels at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
- It travels for 8 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles.

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the bus and the car:
- Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles.

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( A \), and \( J \) respectively.
2. According to the problem, the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + A + J = 100
   \]
3. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   A = J + 10
   \]
4. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = A + J
   \]

Now, let's substitute the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Next, substitute \( A = J + 10 \) and \( P = 2J + 10 \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find the ages of Paul and Peter:
\[
A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50

"First, let's figure out how much hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we calculate the amount for the sheep as follows:

Twice the amount each goat needs: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds.
Three pounds less than this amount: \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds.

So, each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay.

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep:

For the goats: \(15 \text{ goats} \times 5 \text{ pounds/goat} = 75 \text{ pounds}\).
For the sheep: \(12 \text{ sheep} \times 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds}\).

- Total charge = Visit charge + Labor charge + Parts charge
- Total charge = $40 + $78.75 + $60

Let's do the addition:
- Total charge = $40 + $78.75 + $60 = $178.75

So, the total amount Patty charged is:
$178.75"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount. Each CD costs $15, so:
10 CDs * $15/CD = $150

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost:
40% of $150 = 0.40 * $150 = $60

So, the discount is $60. We subtract this from the original total cost to find out how much James actually paid:
$150 - $60 = $90

James then decides he doesn't like 5 of the CDs and sells them for $40. We subtract this amount from what he paid to find out how much money he was out:
$90 - $40 = $50

So, the final amount of money James was out is:
$50"
"To find out how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of crop and then add them together.

1. Calculate the earnings from the yams:
   - Jen has 6 yams.
   - Each yam is sold for $1.5.
   - Total earnings from yams = 6 yams * $1.5/yam = $9.

2. Calculate the earnings from the sweet potatoes:
   - Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
   - Each sweet potato is sold for $2.
   - Total earnings from sweet potatoes = 10 sweet potatoes * $2/sweet potato = $20.

3. Calculate the earnings from the carrots:
   - Jen has 4 carrots.
   - Each carrot is sold for $1.25.
   - Total earnings from carrots = 4 carrots * $1.25/carrot = $5.

4. Add the earnings from all the crops to find the total earnings:
   - Total earnings = Earnings from yams + Earnings from sweet potatoes + Earnings from carrots
   - Total earnings = $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

Therefore, Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time for each part of James's journey.

1. **Swimming the first part:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - 60% of 20 miles is \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.
   - James swims at a speed of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time to swim 12 miles is \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \) hours.

2. **Resting on the island:**
   - James rests for half as long as the time he spent swimming the first part.
   - Rest time is \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours.

3. **Swimming the remaining part:**
   - The remaining distance is \( 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \) miles.
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his original speed.
   - Half of 2 miles per hour is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \) mile per hour.
   - Time to swim 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \) hours.

4. **Total time:**
   - Total time is the sum of the time spent swimming the first part, resting, and swimming the remaining part.
   - Total time is \( 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \) hours.

"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we first need to figure out what ""seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday"" means. 

Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is:
7 * 70 = 490

The bakery has 40 less than this amount, so we subtract 40 from 490:
490 - 40 = 450

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

"To find out how much commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission from each type of newspaper and then add them together.

1. **New York Times Commission:**
   - Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
   - Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = 10% of $5 = 0.10 * $5 = $0.50.
   - He sells 6 copies, so the total commission from the New York Times = 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.

2. **Wall Street Journal Commission:**
   - Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
   - Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.20.
   - He sells 10 copies, so the total commission from the Wall Street Journal = 10 * $1.20 = $12.00.

3. **Total Commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
   - Total commission = $3.00 + $12.00 = $15.00.

So, Cayley will earn a total commission of $15.00.

"To find out how old Leo is, we first need to figure out Marcus's age. We know that Deanna is 26 and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna. So, we can calculate Marcus's age as follows:

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \text{Deanna's age} - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo’s age. So, to find Leo’s age, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age} \]

Substituting Marcus's age into the equation:

\[ 21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age} \]

To find Leo’s age, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Leo's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

So, Leo is 42 years old.

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati as \( B \), by Azibo as \( A \), and by Dinar as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To find out how many pages are in the book, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many sheets of paper are in 1.5 inches.
2. Calculate the total number of pages based on the number of sheets, knowing that each sheet has two pages (one on each side).

First, since the book is 1.5 inches thick and there are 100 pages per inch, we calculate the total number of pages per inch and then for 1.5 inches:
\[ 100 \text{ pages/inch} \times 1.5 \text{ inches} = 150 \text{ pages} \]

Since each sheet of paper has two pages, the number of sheets is:
\[ \frac{150 \text{ pages}}{2 \text{ pages/sheet}} = 75 \text{ sheets} \]

However, the question asks for the total number of pages, which we already calculated as 150 pages.

3. Multiply the number of 15-minute intervals by the number of reports he can staple in each interval.

First, calculate the total time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM:
- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Convert 15 hours into minutes:
- 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

Next, determine how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
- 900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals.

Finally, calculate the total number of reports stapled:
- 60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.

"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the extra time she woke up early.

1. **Total sleep time without interruptions:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - 8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

2. **Time spent sleepwalking:**
   - She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.

3. **Time she woke up early:**
   - She woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.
   - Usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

4. **Total sleep time on the bed:**
   - Total sleep time without interruptions: 480 minutes.
   - Subtract the time spent sleepwalking: 480 - 23 = 457 minutes.
   - Subtract the extra time she woke up early: 457 - 5 = 452 minutes.

So, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day.

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, Jonathan gifts 6 measuring spoons to Pedro. So, the number of measuring spoons left with Jonathan is:
\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:
\[ 24 + 10 = 34 \]

"First, let's find out how many beds are initially occupied in the hospital. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied.

1/5 of 1000 beds = 1000 * (1/5) = 200 beds

So, initially, 200 beds are occupied.

Next, we need to calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and 50 patients are admitted each day.

50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

Now, let's add these 700 patients to the initial 200 occupied beds to find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks.

200 beds + 700 beds = 900 beds

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the hospital's total capacity.

1000 beds - 900 beds = 100 beds

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years old

Now, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, we can calculate Shawna's father's age as follows:

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years old

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's define the number of Pokemon each person has caught:
   - Let \( A \) be the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
   - Let \( W \) be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

2. According to the problem, we have the following information:
   - Together they have caught 339 Pokemon: \( A + S + W = 339 \).
   - Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: \( A = S + 5 \).
   - Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe: \( S = 4W - 13 \).

3. We can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the total equation:
   - From \( A = S + 5 \), we can substitute \( A \) in the total equation: \( (S + 5) + S + W = 339 \).
   - Simplify this to: \( 2S + W + 5 = 339 \).
   - Subtract 5 from both sides: \( 2S + W = 334 \).

4. Now we have two equations:
   - \( 2S + W = 334 \)
   - \( S = 4W - 13 \)

5. Substitute \( S = 4W - 13 \) into the first equation:
   - \( 2(4W - 13) + W = 334 \)
   - Simplify: \( 8W - 26 + W = 334 \)
   - Combine like terms: \( 9W - 26 = 334 \)
   - Add 26 to both sides: \( 9W = 360 \)
   - Divide by 9: \( W = 40 \)

6. Now that we know \( W = 40 \), we can find \( S \):
   - \( S = 4W - 13 \)
   - \( S = 4(40) - 13 \)
   - \( S = 160 - 13 \)
   - \( S = 147 \)

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of episodes in the show.
2. Calculate the total time spent watching all episodes.

First, we know each episode is 20 minutes long. The problem states there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. So, we can calculate the number of episodes as follows:

Number of episodes = 20 minutes per episode / 2 = 10 episodes

Next, we calculate the total time spent watching all episodes:

Total time = Number of episodes × Length of each episode
Total time = 10 episodes × 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the bird traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

1. **First leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles.

2. **Second leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles.

3. **Third leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles.

Now, we add the distances traveled south and subtract the distance traveled north to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes.

Total distance south = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles.
Total distance north = 36 miles.

Net distance = Total distance south - Total distance north = 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles.

So, she kept 2 boxes and sold the rest. To find out how many boxes she sold, we subtract the boxes she kept from the remaining boxes:
8 - 2 = 6 boxes

Each box contains 20 oranges, so to find out how many oranges she sold, we multiply the number of boxes she sold by the number of oranges per box:
6 * 20 = 120 oranges

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges.

"To find out how much Sunny earned over the two days, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold each day and then multiply by the price of each item.

First, let's determine the number of boxes sold on each day:

1. **Saturday:**
   - Gingerbread: 10 boxes
   - Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

2. **Sunday:**
   - Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
   - Apple pie: 15 boxes

Next, we calculate the total number of boxes sold over the two days:

- Total gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
- Total apple pie: 6 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 21 boxes

Now, we calculate the earnings from each item:

- Earnings from gingerbread: 25 boxes * $6/box = $150
- Earnings from apple pie: 21 boxes * $15/box = $315

Finally, we add the earnings from both items to find the total earnings:

- Total earnings: $150 + $315 = $465

"To find out how many servings of crawfish Joe has, we need to first calculate the total amount of crawfish he caught over the three days.

1. On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
2. On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
3. On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

Now, we add up the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[3 + 12 + 6 = 21\] pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we divide the total pounds of crawfish by 3 to find the number of servings:
\[\frac{21}{3} = 7\] servings.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many flowers Pat can fit in her flower bed and then determine how many more flowers she needs to buy.

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower is 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot.

2. **Determine the total space each flower and the space between them will take:**
   - Each flower takes 1 foot of space.
   - There needs to be 1.5 feet of space between each flower.
   - So, each flower and the space between it and the next flower take up 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 feet.

3. **Calculate how many flowers can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - To find out how many flowers can fit, divide the length of the flower bed by the total space each flower and the space between them take up: 
     \[
     \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/flower}} = 44.4 \text{ flowers}
     \]
   - Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a flower, she can plant 44 flowers.

4. **Determine how many more flowers Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.
   - She needs 44 flowers in total.
   - So, she needs to buy:
     \[
     44 - 17 = 27 \text{ flowers}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the flowers:**
   - Each flower costs $6.
   - The total cost for 27 flowers is:
     \[
     27 \times 6 = 162

"First, let's figure out how much soil is used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
12 pounds (for sunflowers) + 15 pounds (for carnations) = 27 pounds

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. So, the remaining soil after planting the sunflowers and carnations is:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"To find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break the problem into two parts: peeling and cooking.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To find out how long it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the number of shrimp she can peel per minute.
   - \( \text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \)

2. **Cooking the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To find out how long it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we first determine how many batches of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp.
   - \( \text{Number of batches} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches} \)
   - Since each batch takes 10 minutes to cook, the total cooking time is:
   - \( \text{Time to cook} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes} \)

3. **Total Time:**
   - To find the total time, we add the time to peel and the time to cook.
   - \( \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \)

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Three times the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Determine the time difference between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - \(90 - 75 = 15\)

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

   - Total number of babies born in a year = 120 (babies per month) \(\times\) 12 (months) = 1440 babies.

4. **Calculate the total population after a year:**
   - Initial population = 50 porcupines.
   - Total number of babies born in a year = 1440.
   - Total population after a year = 50 (initial population) + 1440 (babies) = 1490.

So, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be:

"To find out how much it will cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Use the volume to find out how many gallons of water are needed.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular shape, so we use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.**

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \text{ gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost.**

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[ 826 \]"
"To find the total number of sticks, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. So, the number of blue sticks is 9 (red sticks) + 5 = 14 blue sticks.
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks. So, the number of yellow sticks is 14 (blue sticks) - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.

Now, we add up all the sticks:
- Red sticks: 9
- Blue sticks: 14
- Yellow sticks: 11

Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water pumped into the tank each day and then determine how much more is needed to fill the tank.

1. **Calculate the amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Wanda's first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}

"To find out how much charge the power bank had when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

1. **Calculate the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge before the last 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( x - 0.07 \times 3x = x - 0.21x = 0.79x \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge is 28%.
   - So, \( 0.79x = 28 \).
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{28}{0.79} \approx 35.44\%
     \]

2. **Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge before the first 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( y - 0.09 \times 5y = y - 0.45y = 0.55y \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge is 35.44%.
   - So, \( 0.55y = 35.44 \).
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{35.44}{0.55} \approx 64.44\%

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50 each = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50 each = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00 each = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75 each = $3.75

Now, let's add up these amounts to find the total spent so far:
$1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount is:
$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can calculate how many plums he can buy with the remaining money:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

\[ \text{Future Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 + \text{Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Here, the initial price of carrots is $120, the rate of increase is 5% (or 0.05 as a decimal), and the number of years is 3.

First, we calculate the factor by which the price increases each year:

\[ 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 \]

Next, we raise this factor to the power of 3 (for three years):

\[ 1.05^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, we multiply the initial price by this factor to find the future price:

\[ 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding 138.915 to the nearest integer, we get:

"First, we need to find out how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she uploaded 72 pictures and put them into 8 albums, we divide 72 by 8:

72 ÷ 8 = 9 pictures per album

Next, we need to find out how many albums were for selfies and portraits. According to the problem, 3 albums were selfies and 2 albums were portraits. So, we add these together:

3 albums (selfies) + 2 albums (portraits) = 5 albums

Now, we need to find out how many pictures were selfies and portraits. Since each album has 9 pictures, we multiply the number of albums by the number of pictures per album:

5 albums × 9 pictures per album = 45 pictures

So, Olivia had 45 pictures that were either selfies or portraits.

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to figure out how many minutes it takes him to read 18 pages, given that it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages.

First, we find out how many minutes it takes to read 1 page:
\[ \text{Minutes per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} \]

Next, we use this rate to find out how many minutes it takes to read 18 pages:
\[ \text{Minutes for 18 pages} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} \]

Simplifying the multiplication:
\[ \text{Minutes for 18 pages} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times 3.33 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:**
   - Total number of questions = 60
   - Percentage of easy questions = 40%
   - Number of easy questions = 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24

   - The rest of the questions are equally divided between average and difficult questions.
   - Number of average and difficult questions combined = 60 - 24 = 36
   - Number of average questions = 36 / 2 = 18
   - Number of difficult questions = 36 / 2 = 18

2. **Calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Aries gets 75% of the easy questions correct.
   - Number of easy questions correct = 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18

   - Aries gets half of the average questions correct.
   - Number of average questions correct = 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9

   - Aries gets half of the difficult questions correct.
   - Number of difficult questions correct = 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9

3. **Calculate the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Total correct questions = Number of easy questions correct + Number of average questions correct + Number of difficult questions correct
   - Total correct questions = 18 + 9 + 9 = 36

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 36 points.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the cost of each type of stuffed animal:**
   - Each small stuffed animal costs $4.
   - Each large stuffed animal costs three times the price of a small one, so each large stuffed animal costs \(3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars.

2. **Define the number of each type of stuffed animal sold:**
   - Let \( L \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.
   - Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \).

3. **Set up the equation for the total earnings:**
   - The total earnings from small stuffed animals is \( 4 \times 2L = 8L \) dollars.
   - The total earnings from large stuffed animals is \( 12 \times L = 12L \) dollars.
   - The total earnings from all sales is \( 8L + 12L = 20L \) dollars.

4. **Use the given total earnings to solve for \( L \):**
   - Teresa earned $120 in total, so \( 20L = 120 \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \).

5. **Calculate the number of small stuffed animals sold:**
   - Since \( L = 6 \), the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

So, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider all the scenarios where he does not have to turn it in and then subtract that from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - There's a 50% chance that there will be a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework.
   - This means there's a 50% chance he won't have to turn it in due to a substitute.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - There's a 50% chance that the normal teacher will be there.
   - If the normal teacher is there, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension.
   - This means there's a 50% * 40% = 20% chance he won't have to turn it in due to a class extension.

3. **Personal Extension Scenario:**
   - If the normal teacher is there and doesn't give a class extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.
   - The probability of the normal teacher being there and not giving a class extension is 50% * 60% = 30%.
   - The probability of Marcus getting a personal extension in this case is 30% * 20% = 6%.

Now, we add up all the probabilities where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
- 50% (substitute teacher) + 20% (class extension) + 6% (personal extension) = 76%.

Finally, we subtract this from 100% to find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:
- 100% - 76% = 24%.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pencils:
- Ted buys 3 pencils.
- Each pencil costs $6.
- Total cost for pencils = 3 pencils * $6/pencil = $18.

Now, we add the total cost of the books and the total cost of the pencils to find the total amount spent:
- Total amount spent = Total cost for books + Total cost for pencils = $48 + $18 = $66.

So, Ted spent a total of $66.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many soda bottles Richard will place and how long it will take him to go from the first bottle to the last one.

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - Number of bottles = 24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles.

2. **Calculate the time to go from one bottle to the next:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next.
   - Since he starts at the first bottle, he only needs to move between the bottles, not to the first one.
   - Number of moves between bottles = Number of bottles - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7 moves.

3. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = Number of moves × Time per move = 7 moves × 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds.

So, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 35 seconds.

"To find out how many packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of apples Uncle Franky has.
2. Determine how many packs he can make with the total number of apples.

First, we know that one box contains 40 apples. Uncle Franky ordered two boxes, so:
\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of 8 apples each he can make from 80 apples:
\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total amount of loans Jim took:**
   - Jim takes $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   - Total loans = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000

2. **Calculate the total income Jim lost by not working during college:**
   - Jim could have earned $25,000 per year if he had not gone to college.
   - Total income lost = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to cover the loans and the lost income:**
   - Total amount needed = Total loans + Total income lost
   - Total amount needed = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

4. **Calculate Jim's new income after college:**
   - Jim's new income is triple his previous income.
   - New income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

5. **Calculate the net income Jim earns each year after college:**
   - Net income per year = New income - Previous income
   - Net income per year = $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000 per year

6. **Calculate the number of years it will take Jim to earn the total amount needed:**
   - Number of years = Total amount needed / Net income per year
   - Number of years = $300,000 / $50,000 = 6 years

So, it will take Jim 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To find out how much fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Jim needs pieces that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

First, we add 2 feet to the length and the width of the bed:
- Length of fabric piece: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
- Width of fabric piece: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
- Area of one piece = Length × Width = 8 feet × 10 feet = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
- Total area needed = 80 square feet × 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then add them up.

1. **Monday:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - They delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday.
   - One-fifth of Monday's letters: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - Adding 17 to this: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)
   - So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice Tuesday's letters: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - Adding 5 to this: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)
   - So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

4. **Total letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - Monday: 425
   - Tuesday: 102
   - Wednesday: 209
   - Adding these together: \( 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \)

So, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736.

"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Loss: $5

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - Amount won: \(10 + 1 = 11\)

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount lost: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- Total loss = Loss in the first race + Loss in the third race
- Total loss = \(5 + 16.5 = 21.5\)

Next, we calculate the average loss per race:
- Number of races = 3
- Average loss = Total loss / Number of races
- Average loss = \(21.5 / 3 = 7.1667\)

Rounding to two decimal places, the average loss is approximately $7.17.

"First, we need to convert all heights to the same unit. Let's use inches.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is:
4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's initial height was 50 inches and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier’s height:
52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch

"Let's denote the amount the first person took as \( x \).

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person took \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( x = 420 \).

"To find out how many hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of days worked:**
   - The team worked for 3 weeks.
   - Each week has 7 days.
   - So, the total number of days is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

2. **Calculate the total fraction of a day worked each day:**
   - The team worked \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day.

3. **Calculate the total fraction of a day worked over the 21 days:**
   - Total fraction of a day worked is \( 21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} \) days.

4. **Convert the total fraction of a day into hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - So, the total hours worked is \( \frac{63}{8} \times 24 = 63 \times 3 = 189 \) hours.

5. **Calculate the hours of work per painter:**
   - There are 4 painters.
   - Each painter worked \( \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \) hours.

So, each painter put in 47.25 hours of work.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set be \( x \).
2. In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
3. In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

According to the problem, the total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. So, we can write the equation:

\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve this equation, first combine like terms:

\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

So, the number of balls retrieved in the second set is 6. Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is 10.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year.

1. **Initial Price in 2007**: $20,000
2. **Depreciation Rate**: 21% per year, which means the car retains 79% of its value each year (100% - 21% = 79%).

We need to calculate the price of the car after 3 years (from 2007 to 2010).

The formula to calculate the price after depreciation is:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

First, calculate \(0.79^3\):
\[ 0.79^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 \approx 0.493 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times 0.493 = 9860 \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ 9860 \]"

"To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of food the cats eat in one day.
2. Divide the total amount of food Imma has by the amount the cats eat in one day.

First, we know that Imma feeds her cats 60 grams of food twice a day. So, the total amount of food each cat eats in one day is:
\[ 60 \text{ grams/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 120 \text{ grams/day} \]

Since Imma has 3 cats, the total amount of food all the cats eat in one day is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams/day/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of food by the amount the cats eat in one day:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many slices Jake ate:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake.
   - Therefore, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.

2. **Determine how many slices Silvia ate:**
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake.
   - Therefore, Silvia ate \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.

"First, let's figure out how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many are left.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:
70% of 20 = 0.70 * 20 = 14 pizzas

So, the glee club has:
20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left

Next, the football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club:
2 * 20 = 40 pizzas

The football team ate 80% of them:
80% of 40 = 0.80 * 40 = 32 pizzas

So, the football team has:
40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left

Now, let's add the pizzas left from both groups:
6 + 8 = 14 pizzas

"To find out how much Anthony spends on postage, we need to calculate the cost for both the small and big coupons and then add them together.

1. **Calculate the number of big coupons:**
   - Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons.
   - Number of small coupons = 700
   - Number of big coupons = 2 * 700 = 1400

2. **Calculate the cost for the small coupons:**
   - Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail.
   - Total cost for small coupons = 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents

3. **Calculate the cost for the big coupons:**
   - Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail.
   - Total cost for big coupons = 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost for small coupons + Cost for big coupons
   - Total cost = 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents

5. **Convert the total cost to dollars:**
   - 100 cents = 1 dollar
   - Total cost in dollars = 24500 cents / 100 = 245 dollars

So, Anthony spends a total of 245 dollars on postage.

"First, let's figure out how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means:

10 - 3 = 7 sandwiches

Then, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sandwiches, so Sidney had:

7 - 4 = 3 sandwiches left

Sidney then ordered another 3 sandwiches, so the total number of sandwiches Sidney had was:

3 + 3 = 6 sandwiches

Since each sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sandwiches is:

6 sandwiches * 4 meatballs/sandwich = 24 meatballs

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of trucks that had mechanical failures.
2. Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser.
3. Calculate the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the trucks that did not have mechanical failures.

Step 1: Calculate the number of trucks with mechanical failures.
- Mr Hezekiah dispatched 20 trucks.
- A quarter of these trucks had mechanical failures.
- Number of trucks with mechanical failures = 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Step 2: Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser.
- Total trucks dispatched = 20
- Trucks with mechanical failures = 5
- Trucks that successfully delivered = 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of fertiliser delivered.
- Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser.
- Total fertiliser delivered = 15 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 300 tons.

So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons.

"To find out how much Dennis will spend on butter, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of butter needed:**
   - Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
   - He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   - Therefore, he needs \( 6 \) pounds of butter.

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   - The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off.""
   - This means for every 2 pounds of butter, he pays full price for 1 pound and half price for the other pound.

3. **Calculate the cost for 2 pounds of butter:**
   - Full price for 1 pound: \( \$4.00 \)
   - Half price for 1 pound: \( \$4.00 / 2 = \$2.00 \)
   - Total cost for 2 pounds: \( \$4.00 + \$2.00 = \$6.00 \)

4. **Calculate the cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   - Since 6 pounds is 3 sets of 2 pounds, we multiply the cost for 2 pounds by 3.
   - Total cost for 6 pounds: \( 3 \times \$6.00 = \$18.00 \)

Therefore, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is \( \$18.00 \).

"First, let's figure out how many people Kayla invited in total. She invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. That's:

25 + 7 + 13 = 45 people

However, 4 people said they could not come, so the number of people attending is:

45 - 4 = 41 people

The theater has a base fee of $125 for the first 20 people. For the additional guests, which is 41 - 20 = 21 people, there is an extra charge of $6 per person. The cost for the additional guests is:

21 * 6 = $126

Now, we add the base fee to the cost for the additional guests to find the total cost:

125 + 126 = $251

So, the total cost for the party is $251.

"First, let's figure out how much money Maggie and Riza each spent.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money. Since Maggie had $60:
\[ \text{Maggie's spending} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]

So, Maggie has:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Riza spent one-third of her money. Since Riza also had $60:
\[ \text{Riza's spending} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

So, Riza has:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Now, let's add the remaining amounts of money that Maggie and Riza have:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bananas eaten by all monkeys in a week.
2. Determine the daily banana consumption for the first and second monkeys.
3. Subtract the total daily consumption of the first and second monkeys from the total daily consumption to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day.

First, we know Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. This means the total number of bananas eaten by all monkeys in a week is 315.

Next, we calculate the daily consumption for the first and second monkeys:
- The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
- The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Now, we find the total daily consumption of the first and second monkeys:
- First monkey: 10 bananas/day
- Second monkey: 14 bananas/day
- Total for the first and second monkeys: 10 + 14 = 24 bananas/day

Since the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315, we can find the daily total consumption by dividing 315 by 7 (the number of days in a week):
- Total daily consumption: 315 / 7 = 45 bananas/day

Finally, we subtract the total daily consumption of the first and second monkeys from the total daily consumption to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day:
- Total daily consumption: 45 bananas/day
- Consumption by the first and second monkeys: 24 bananas/day
- Consumption by the third monkey: 45 - 24 = 21 bananas/day

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"First, let's figure out how much Jenny spends on the roses. Since she bought 15 roses, we can calculate the cost in two ways:

1. **By the dozen rate:** 12 roses cost $15, so for 15 roses, she would pay for one dozen and 3 extra roses. The cost for 3 extra roses at $2 each is 3 * $2 = $6. So, the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.
2. **By the single rate:** 15 roses at $2 each would be 15 * $2 = $30. However, this method is not the most cost-effective, so we'll use the first method.

Jenny arrived with five 5 dollar bills, which totals 5 * $5 = $25.

Now, let's calculate the change she should receive:
$25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $4 into quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so:
$4 / $0.25 = 16 quarters.

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

"To find out how much money Terry makes in total, we need to calculate the total sales for each item and then add them together.

1. **Milkshakes:**
   - Number of milkshakes sold: 6
   - Price per milkshake: $5.50
   - Total from milkshakes: \( 6 \times 5.50 = 33.00 \)

2. **Burger platters:**
   - Number of burger platters sold: 9
   - Price per burger platter: $11
   - Total from burger platters: \( 9 \times 11 = 99.00 \)

3. **Sodas:**
   - Number of sodas sold: 20
   - Price per soda: $1.50
   - Total from sodas: \( 20 \times 1.50 = 30.00 \)

Now, we add the totals from each item to find the total amount of money Terry makes:

- Total from milkshakes: $33.00
- Total from burger platters: $99.00
- Total from sodas: $30.00

Total money made: \( 33.00 + 99.00 + 30.00 = 162.00 \)

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Paul will wait for his train by considering the arrival and departure times of each train.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departs 10 + 20 = 30 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves.
   - First train leaves at 30 minutes, so the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - Departs 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - Second train leaves at 65 minutes, so the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes.
   - Leaves immediately after arriving, so it departs at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - Third train leaves at 125 minutes, so the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Therefore, Paul will wait for a total of 145 minutes for his train.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many toothpicks Melanie has already collected and how many more she needs to reach 200 toothpicks.

1. First, calculate the total number of toothpicks Melanie has saved so far:
   - She saves 10 toothpicks each week.
   - She has been saving for 12 weeks.
   - Total toothpicks saved = 10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks.

2. Next, determine how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to reach 200:
   - Total toothpicks needed = 200
   - Toothpicks already saved = 120
   - Toothpicks still needed = 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks.

3. Finally, calculate how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks:
   - She saves 10 toothpicks each week.
   - Weeks needed = 80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks.

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend.
3. Determine the discount percentage from the original price that Mr. Rogers' friend received.

**Step 1: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.**

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend.**

Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he paid.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold to his friend} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

**Step 3: Determine the discount percentage from the original price that Mr. Rogers' friend received.**

The original price of the watch is $2000, and Mr. Rogers' friend bought it for $1800. The discount is the difference between the original price and the price Mr. Rogers' friend paid.

\[ \text{Discount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the discount percentage:

\[ \text{Discount percentage} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Distance from home to the store**: 4 miles.
2. **Halfway to the store**: 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.
3. **Total distance walked**: 
   - James walks 2 miles to the halfway point.
   - He then walks back home, which is another 2 miles.
   - Finally, he walks the full 4 miles to the store.
   - Total distance = 2 miles + 2 miles + 4 miles = 8 miles.

4. **Walking speed**: 4 miles per hour.

"To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the cost of the bananas both ways and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Each bunch averages 4 bananas.
- Total number of bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Each banana costs $0.80.
- Total cost for 40 bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Each bunch costs $3.00.
- Total cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

Finally, let's find out how much money Jenny saved:
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

So, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

1. **Total Fence**: Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence in total.
2. **Difference in Amount**: Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

Let's say Sam gets \( S \) feet of fence. Then Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet of fence.

3. **Total Fence Equation**:
   \[
   S + (S + 60) = 100
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2S + 60 = 100

"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of bike and then sum them up.

1. **Determine the number of each type of bike sold:**
   - Total bikes sold: 300
   - Trekking bikes: 50% of 300 = 0.5 * 300 = 150
   - BMX bikes: 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
   - MTB bikes: The rest of the bikes = 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

2. **Calculate the earnings from each type of bike:**
   - Price of one MTB: $500
   - Price of one BMX: $500 / 2 = $250
   - Price of one Trekking bike: $450

   - Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
   - Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
   - Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

3. **Calculate the total earnings:**

"First, let's calculate the total number of periods John has in a week. He has 6 periods a day for 5 days, plus 2 extra classes each day.

\[ 6 \text{ periods/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 30 \text{ periods/week} \]
\[ 2 \text{ extra classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ extra classes/week} \]
\[ 30 \text{ periods/week} + 10 \text{ extra classes/week} = 40 \text{ periods/week} \]

Each period is 40 minutes long, so the total minutes spent in class each week is:

\[ 40 \text{ periods/week} \times 40 \text{ minutes/period} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

John spends 1/16 of his weekly class time on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. First, we calculate the extra learning time:

\[ \frac{1600 \text{ minutes/week}}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Now, we add the extra learning time to the total class time to get the total weekly learning time:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 100 \text{ minutes/week} = 1700 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how far each train travels in 3 hours and then add those distances together to find out how far apart they are.

1. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour.
   - In 3 hours, it will travel: \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \).

2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 30 miles per hour.
   - In 3 hours, it will travel: \( 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \).

3. To find out how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we add the distances they have each traveled:
   - \( 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \).

So, the two trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours.

"First, let's figure out the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.

- March has 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.

So, the total number of days is:
31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

Billy takes 20% of these days off. Let's calculate 20% of 50 days:
20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

So, Billy takes 10 days off. This means he works:
50 days - 10 days = 40 days

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. So, each day he helps:
2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day

Now, let's calculate the total number of people he helps over the 40 days:
6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people

So, the total number of people Billy helps is:
240

"To find out how many people were inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the cars and buses could carry.

First, let's calculate the number of people the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.
- So, the total number of people the buses could carry is \(12 \times 35 = 420\).

Next, let's calculate the number of people the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.
- So, the total number of people the cars could carry is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).

Now, we add the number of people the buses and cars could carry to find the total number of people:
- Total number of people = \(420 + 60 = 480\).

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is 480.

"To find out how many hours Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to after 5 days, we need to calculate the total time he spends on these activities each day and then multiply by 5.

1. **Calculate the total break time per day:**
   - Bobby takes 2 breaks, each 15 minutes long.
   - Total break time per day = 2 breaks * 15 minutes/break = 30 minutes.

2. **Calculate the total time for lunch and breaks per day:**
   - Lunch time per day = 30 minutes.
   - Total time for lunch and breaks per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes.

3. **Convert the total time per day to hours:**
   - 60 minutes = 1 hour.

4. **Calculate the total time for 5 days:**
   - Total time for 5 days = 5 days * 1 hour/day = 5 hours.

"First, let's figure out the initial balance after Sheila returned the $15.00 item. She originally charged $85.00, so:

Initial charge: $85.00
Return: $15.00
New balance after return: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the frying pan after the 20% discount. The original price of the frying pan is $20.00, so:

Discount on frying pan: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Price after discount: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the set of towels after the 10% discount. The original price of the towels is $30.00, so:

Discount on towels: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Price after discount: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, we add the cost of the frying pan and the towels to the new balance after the return:

New balance after return: $70.00
Cost of frying pan: $16.00
Cost of towels: $27.00
Total new charges: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00
Final balance: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the total number of jellyfish in the tank be \( x \).
2. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{x}{5} \).
3. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{x}{5} = \frac{x}{15} \).
4. We are told that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. So, \( \frac{x}{15} = 6 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{15} = 6 \]
\[ x = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ x = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Lauren needs to save for her retirement and how long it will take her to save that amount.

1. **Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs for retirement:**
   - Lauren wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - Current annual salary = $100,000.
   - Annual retirement income needed = 40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000.

2. **Calculate the total amount needed for 20 years of retirement:**
   - Total retirement savings needed = Annual retirement income needed * Number of years in retirement.
   - Total retirement savings needed = $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

3. **Determine how much Lauren saves each year:**
   - Lauren saves 20% of her annual salary.
   - Annual savings = 20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000.

4. **Calculate the number of years needed to save $800,000:**
   - Number of years = Total retirement savings needed / Annual savings.
   - Number of years = $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement.

"To find out how long each final cut of the ribbon will be, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of initial parts Marty wants to cut it into. Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon and he wants to cut it into 4 equal parts.
   \[
   \text{Length of each initial part} = \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm}
   \]

2. Next, each of these 25 cm parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts.
   \[
   \text{Length of each final cut} = \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}
   \]

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

"To find out how many girls are in the school, we first need to determine the total population of the school. We know that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. 

1. **Find the total population of the school:**
   - If 40% of the school population is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     0.40 \times \text{Total Population} = 240
     \]
   - To find the total population, we divide both sides by 0.40:
     \[
     \text{Total Population} = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of girls:**
   - The total population is 600, and we know there are 240 boys.
   - The number of girls is the total population minus the number of boys:
     \[
     \text{Number of Girls} = 600 - 240 = 360
     \]

So, the number of girls in the school is 360.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total miles to hike in June:** 9,300 miles
2. **Number of days in June:** 30 days
3. **Miles Soledad plans to hike each day:** 125 miles twice a day, which is \(125 \times 2 = 250\) miles per day.

Next, we calculate the total miles Soledad will hike if she sticks to her plan:
\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7,500 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we find out how many more miles she needs to hike to reach her goal:
\[ 9,300 \text{ miles} - 7,500 \text{ miles} = 1,800 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we divide the additional miles by the number of days in June:
\[ \frac{1,800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"To find out how much Elijah and Kory’s dogs weigh altogether, we first need to calculate the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory’s dog.

Kory’s dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah’s first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah’s second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weights of all three dogs together:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]

3. **Eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline together**: 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.
4. **Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs**: So, each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now, let's figure out how many eggs Camden and Sarah each painted:
5. **Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah**. Let's say Sarah painted \( S \) eggs. Then Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.
6. **Total eggs painted by Camden and Sarah**: \( S + (S + 12) = 30 \).
7. Simplify the equation: \( 2S + 12 = 30 \).
8. Subtract 12 from both sides: \( 2S = 18 \).
9. Divide by 2: \( S = 9 \).

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

Finally, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
10. **Camden painted 21 eggs**.
11. **Arnold painted 13 eggs**.
12. **Difference**: 21 - 13 = 8.

Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"First, we need to find out how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make with 200 crayons. We do this by dividing 200 by 8:
\[ 200 \div 8 = 25 \]
So, Nik can make 25 groups of 8 crayons.

Next, we need to find out the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and there are 200 crayons:
\[ 200 \times 1 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces and there are 25 boxes:
\[ 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives us the total weight in ounces:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

To convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, we divide by 16 (since there are 16 ounces in a pound):
\[ 400 \div 16 = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

"First, we need to find out how much of the tree can be used for logs. John can use 80% of the 80-foot tree, so:

80 feet * 80% = 80 feet * 0.8 = 64 feet

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs can be made from the 64 feet of usable tree:

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each log, John can cut 5 planks, so:

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Each plank is sold for $1.2, so the total amount John makes is:

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

"First, let's find out how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, we can calculate her brother's earnings as follows:

\[ \text{Brother's earnings} = 2 \times 5000 = 10000 \]

Next, we need to find the combined salary of Valerie and her brother:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so:

\[ \text{Mother's earnings} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money they all have together, we add up the earnings of Valerie, her brother, and their mother:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking the 3 miles, given the different speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

1. **Determine Grandma's speed on the beach:**
   - Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes.
   - Speed on the beach = Distance / Time = 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

2. **Determine Grandma's speed on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk.
   - Speed on the sidewalk = 2 * 0.05 miles per minute = 0.1 miles per minute.

3. **Calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk:**
   - Distance on the sidewalk = 1 mile.
   - Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

4. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   - Time on the beach = 40 minutes.
   - Time on the sidewalk = 10 minutes.
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 50 minutes.

"First, let's figure out how much Jane has already saved. She saves $4 every week, and she has been saving for 8 weeks. So, we multiply $4 by 8 weeks:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Jane has saved $32 so far. She wants to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[ 60 - 32 = 28 \]

Jane needs to save $28 more. Since she saves $4 each week, we divide the remaining amount by $4 to find out how many more weeks she needs to save:

\[ 28 \div 4 = 7 \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds in the trees, we can break down the problem into parts and then add the results together.

1. **3 trees each had 7 blue birds:**
   - Number of blue birds in these trees = 3 trees * 7 blue birds/tree = 21 blue birds

2. **2 different trees each had 4 blue birds:**
   - Number of blue birds in these trees = 2 trees * 4 blue birds/tree = 8 blue birds

3. **1 final tree had 3 blue birds:**
   - Number of blue birds in this tree = 1 tree * 3 blue birds/tree = 3 blue birds

Now, we add the number of blue birds from all the trees together:
- Total number of blue birds = 21 blue birds + 8 blue birds + 3 blue birds = 32 blue birds

"First, let's figure out how many marbles Bob has initially. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24.

So, if Bob gets 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This means that before receiving the extra marbles, Bob has:
60 - 24 = 36 marbles.

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we need to subtract 10 from the 36 marbles he originally has:
36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

So, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that would allow Donny to drink the mixed water. 

1. **Identify the known values:**
   - The temperature of the first mug is 33 degrees.
   - Donny pours 4 ounces from the first mug.
   - Donny pours 1 ounce from the second mug.
   - The final temperature of the mixed water must be at least 40 degrees.

2. **Set up the equation for the final temperature:**
   - Let \( T \) be the temperature of the water in the second mug.
   - The total amount of water mixed is 4 ounces + 1 ounce = 5 ounces.
   - The final temperature \( T_f \) of the mixed water can be calculated using the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs:
     \[
     T_f = \frac{(4 \text{ ounces} \times 33 \text{ degrees}) + (1 \text{ ounce} \times T)}{5 \text{ ounces}}
     \]

3. **Set up the inequality for the final temperature:**
   - We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:
     \[
     \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
     \]

4. **Solve the inequality:**
   - First, simplify the numerator:
     \[
     \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     132 + T \geq 200
     \]
   - Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):
     \[
     T \geq 68
     \]

Therefore, the temperature of the water in the second mug must be at least 68 degrees.

"First, let's figure out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, we calculate:

23 - 5 = 18 scoops

Next, we need to determine how many potatoes are used to make the scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we calculate:

6 - 3 = 3 potatoes
3 - 1 = 2 scoops

This means it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. We set up a proportion:

3 potatoes / 2 scoops = x potatoes / 18 scoops

To solve for x, we cross-multiply and divide:

3 * 18 = 2 * x
54 = 2x
x = 54 / 2
x = 27

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

The total number of reports received last week is 5168.

The total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday is 1907.

The total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday is 2136.

First, we add the reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
1907 + 2136 = 4043

Next, we subtract this total from the total number of reports received last week:
5168 - 4043 = 1125

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125.

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
2. He sells half of the land for $50.
   - Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters.
   - So, he has 80 - 40 = 40 square meters left.

3. After a month, he sells another 1/4 of his remaining land for $30.
   - 1/4 of 40 square meters is 10 square meters.
   - So, he has 40 - 10 = 30 square meters left.

4. He then sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter.
   - 30 square meters * $3/square meter = $90.

Now, let's add up all the money he earned:
- From the first sale: $50
- From the second sale: $30
- From the third sale: $90

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $90 = $170

"To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
2. Find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
3. Calculate the total number of collections he makes in a week.
4. Calculate his total earnings based on the number of collections and the rate he gets paid.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.**

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. To find the number of apartments in the third complex:
\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \]
\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

**Step 2: Find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.**

Adding the apartments from all three complexes:
\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of collections he makes in a week.**

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment:
\[ 1040 \text{ apartments} \times 3 \text{ times/week} = 3120 \text{ collections/week} \]

**Step 4: Calculate his total earnings based on the number of collections and the rate he gets paid.**

He gets paid $0.40 per collection:
\[ 3120 \text{ collections/week} \times 0.40 \text{ dollars/collection} = 1248 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, John makes:

"To find out how many total fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree**: 50 fruits
2. **6-year-old tree**: 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. **7-year-old tree**: 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. **8-year-old tree**: 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We need to find out how many fruits a 10-year-old tree produces first.
5. **9-year-old tree**: 0 fruits (as given)
6. **10-year-old tree**: 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, we can find out how many fruits an 8-year-old tree produces:
- 8-year-old tree: 1000 fruits (10-year-old) - 200 fruits = 800 fruits

Next, we sum up the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the length of the blue rope be \( B \) centimeters.
2. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.
3. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.
4. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   B + 4B + (B + 7) = 37
   \]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   6B + 7 = 37
   \]
6. Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   6B = 30

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the initial amounts of money:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the amount of money Rissa gave to her little sister:**
   - After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her initial money.
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - Rissa's remaining money is \( 15 - x \).
   - According to the problem, \( 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \).

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Calculate \( \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \):
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
     \]
   - So, \( 15 - x = 12 \).
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cloud puffs Alice counts each day from Monday to Friday, and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
2. **Tuesday**: She counts double the number from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She counts double the number from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She counts double the number from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She counts double the number from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we add up all the puffs from each day:
\[ 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 \]

Let's do the addition step by step:
\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]
\[ 9 + 12 = 21 \]

1. Determine the length of the chalk left after Monday.
2. Calculate how much chalk is used each day after Monday.
3. Determine how many days it will take for the chalk to be less than 2 inches.

**Step 1: Determine the length of the chalk left after Monday.**

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he uses 45% of it.

\[ \text{Chalk used on Monday} = 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches} \]

\[ \text{Chalk left after Monday} = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

**Step 2: Calculate how much chalk is used each day after Monday.**

The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.

\[ \text{Chalk used each day} = 2.75 \times 0.20 = 0.55 \text{ inches} \]

**Step 3: Determine how many days it will take for the chalk to be less than 2 inches.**

We need to find out how many days it will take for the remaining chalk to be less than 2 inches. We start with 2.75 inches and subtract 0.55 inches each day.

Let's calculate the remaining length of the chalk each day:

"Let's use algebra to solve this problem. We'll use \( W \) to represent Wendy's current age and \( C \) to represent Colin's current age.

From the first statement: ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.""
This can be written as:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement: ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.""
This can be written as:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5C + 35}{3} \]
Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]
Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

   - John is 28 years old now (in 2023).
   - So, in 2003, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out:**
   - When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - If John was 8 years old, then Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

4. **Determine Jim's current age:**
   - Since 20 years have passed since 2003, Jim is now 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

So, Jim is 24 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - The nurses used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bandages they started with on the first day.
   - After using 38 bandages, they had \( x - 38 \) bandages left.
   - After ordering one bulk pack, they had \( x - 38 + 50 \) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \( 38 - 10 = 28 \) bandages.
   - After using 28 bandages, they had \( (x - 38 + 50) - 28 \) bandages left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they added \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \( 50 / 2 = 25 \) bandages.
   - After using 25 bandages, they had \( ((x - 38 + 50) - 28 + 100) - 25 \) bandages left.

4. **Final Condition:**
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.
   - So, we set up the equation:
     \[
     ((x - 38 + 50) - 28 + 100) - 25 = 78
     \]

5. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     (x + 12 + 100) - 25 = 78
     \]
     \[
     x + 112 - 25 = 78
     \]
     \[
     x + 87 = 78
     \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 87 from both sides:
     \[
     x = 78 - 87
     \]
     \[
     x = -9
     \]

However, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem because the number of bandages cannot be negative. Let's recheck the steps:

- The equation should be:
  \[
  (x + 12 + 100) - 25 = 78
  \]
  \[
  x + 87 = 78
  \]
  \[
  x = 78 - 87
  \]
  \[
  x = -9
  \]

This indicates a mistake in the setup. Let's re-evaluate the steps:

- Correct setup:
  \[
  (x - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25) = 78
  \]
  \[
  x + 59 = 78
  \]
  \[
  x = 78 - 59
  \]
  \[
  x = 19
  \]

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is:

"To find out how much May's haircut and color cost, we need to calculate the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut separately, and then add them together.

1. The cost of the color is a flat rate of $40.
2. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch of hair cut off. May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, so 2 inches were cut off.

Now, we calculate the cost of the haircut:
- 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60

Next, we add the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut:
- $40 (color) + $60 (haircut) = $100

So, the total cost for May's cut and color is:

"To find out how much Jen will receive in April, we need to calculate her earnings from her hourly work and her additional attendance bonus.

1. **Calculate the weekly earnings from hourly work:**
   - Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week.
   - Total hours worked in a week = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week.
   - Her hourly rate is $1.5.
   - Weekly earnings from hourly work = 45 hours/week * $1.5/hour = $67.5/week.

2. **Calculate the monthly earnings from hourly work:**
   - There are 4 weeks in April.
   - Monthly earnings from hourly work = $67.5/week * 4 weeks = $270.

3. **Calculate the attendance bonus:**
   - Jen receives an additional $10 for complete attendance each week.
   - Monthly attendance bonus = $10/week * 4 weeks = $40.

4. **Calculate the total monthly earnings:**
   - Total monthly earnings = Monthly earnings from hourly work + Monthly attendance bonus
   - Total monthly earnings = $270 + $40 = $310.

So, Jen will receive $310 in April.

"First, let's find out how much each bottle of scotch costs:
- John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600.
- So, the cost per bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60.

Next, let's determine the number of bottles of cognac John buys:
- He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch.
- So, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

Now, let's find out the cost per bottle of cognac:
- Each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than a bottle of scotch.
- 50% of $60 is $60 * 0.50 = $30.
- So, each bottle of cognac costs $60 + $30 = $90.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the cognac:
- 20 bottles of cognac at $90 each is 20 * $90 = $1800.

Finally, let's find the total amount John spends on everything:
- The total cost of scotch is $600.
- The total cost of cognac is $1800.
- So, the total amount spent is $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"First, let's figure out how many trees Mr. Julius planted on the first day.

1. He planted 20 White Oak trees.
2. He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, so:
   \[
   2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ Lodgepole Pine trees}
   \]

Next, let's calculate the number of trees he planted on the second day.

1. He planted 10 more White Oak trees, so:
   \[
   20 + 10 = 30 \text{ White Oak trees}
   \]
2. He planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day. First, we find 1/4 of 40:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
   \]
   Then, we add this to the 40 Lodgepole Pine trees he planted on the first day:
   \[
   40 + 10 = 50 \text{ Lodgepole Pine trees}

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information about the average distance the dogs need to walk per day.

The average distance for the 4 dogs is 3 miles. This means the total distance for all 4 dogs combined is:
\[ 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

We know the distances the first three dogs need to walk:
- First dog: 1 mile
- Second dog: 4 miles
- Third dog: 3 miles

Adding these distances together gives:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find the distance the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total distance the first three dogs need to walk from the total distance for all four dogs:
\[ 12 - 8 = 4 \text{ miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar is a rectangular prism with a square base.
   - Base area = 6 inches * 6 inches = 36 square inches
   - Height = 15 inches
   - Volume of the jar = Base area * Height = 36 square inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches

2. **Calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans:**
   The jelly beans only occupy 80% of the jar's volume due to packing efficiency.
   - Effective volume = 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans in the jar:**

"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames.

First, we calculate the cost of the wooden tables:
- John made 4 wooden tables.
- Each table costs $20.
- So, the total cost for the tables is 4 tables * $20/table = $80.

Next, we calculate the cost of the roof frames:
- John made 2 roof frames.
- Each roof frame costs $10.
- So, the total cost for the roof frames is 2 frames * $10/frame = $20.

Now, we add the total costs of the tables and the frames to find the total amount Ali has to pay:
- Total cost = Cost of tables + Cost of frames
- Total cost = $80 + $20 = $100.

So, Ali has to pay John $100.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's call the length of the shorter piece \( x \) feet.
2. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.
3. The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is \( x + 4x \).
4. We know the total length of the board is 40 feet, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   x + 4x = 40
   \]
5. Combine like terms:
   \[
   5x = 40
   \]
6. Solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 5:
   \[
   x = 8
   \]
7. The length of the shorter piece is 8 feet.
8. The length of the longer piece is \( 4x \), which is \( 4 \times 8 = 32 \) feet.

So, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
   - Let \( b \) be the number of brownies Carly makes.

2. **Set up the relationship between the number of brownies and cupcakes:**
   - According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.
   - This can be written as: \( b = 3c - 2 \).

3. **Determine the total number of treats:**
   - Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats.
   - Therefore, the total number of treats is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).

4. **Set up the equation for the total number of treats:**
   - The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies.
   - This can be written as: \( c + b = 10 \).

5. **Substitute the expression for \( b \) into the total treats equation:**
   - Substitute \( b = 3c - 2 \) into \( c + b = 10 \):
   - \( c + (3c - 2) = 10 \).

6. **Solve for \( c \):**
   - Combine like terms: \( 4c - 2 = 10 \).
   - Add 2 to both sides: \( 4c = 12 \).
   - Divide by 4: \( c = 3 \).

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount.

The cost of a basic manicure is $35.
The cost of a basic pedicure is $40.

The total cost without the discount is:
$35 + $40 = $75

The discount is 20%, so the discount amount is:
20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15

The total cost after the discount is:
$75 - $15 = $60

Next, we calculate the cost of the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers. Assuming she has 10 fingers (5 on each hand), the cost for nail art is:
10 nails * $3 per nail = $30

Now, we add the cost of the nail art to the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure:
$60 + $30 = $90

Therefore, the total amount Karen would pay is:
$90"

"To find out how many paintings Kim has, we can start by figuring out how many paintings Shelley has, since we know the relationship between Samantha's and Shelley's paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. Since Samantha has 27 paintings, we can set up the equation:
\[ \text{Shelley's paintings} = \text{Samantha's paintings} + 12 \]
\[ \text{Shelley's paintings} = 27 + 12 \]
\[ \text{Shelley's paintings} = 39 \]

Now, we know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. We can set up another equation to find out how many paintings Kim has:
\[ \text{Shelley's paintings} = \text{Kim's paintings} + 8 \]
\[ 39 = \text{Kim's paintings} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Kim's paintings} = 39 - 8 \]
\[ \text{Kim's paintings} = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings.

   - Total earnings from standard rate lessons = 4 lessons * $80/lesson = $320.

2. **Veteran Rate Lessons:**
   - The rate for veterans is reduced by 25%.
   - 25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20.
   - Reduced rate for veterans = $80 - $20 = $60 per hour.
   - He has 2 lessons at this rate.
   - Total earnings from veteran rate lessons = 2 lessons * $60/lesson = $120.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings for the day = Earnings from standard rate lessons + Earnings from veteran rate lessons.
   - Total earnings = $320 + $120 = $440.

So, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440.

"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Use the formula for percentage to find out what part of the total distance (6000 km) he has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Since he travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, there are:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the total distance he travels in 72 hours:
\[ 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out what percentage 3600 km is of the total distance of 6000 km. We use the percentage formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{3600}{6000} \right) \times 100 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break down the time it takes John to solve each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second side takes twice as long as the first side, so it takes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes.
3. The third side also takes twice as long as the first side, so it takes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes.
4. The fourth side takes half as long as the first side, so it takes \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes.
5. The fifth side also takes half as long as the first side, so it takes \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides:
\[ 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 \]

So, the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

   - Number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour = 60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges.

3. **Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:**
   - Difference = Number of oranges Ana can peel - Number of oranges Jane can peel
   - Difference = 20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 oranges.

So, after one hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original price is $400, and he gets it for 80% off.

80% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, the discount is $320. Therefore, the cost of the radiator after the discount is:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the total amount Mark paid is:
230"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations. Let's define:
- \( C \) as the number of chickens.
- \( K \) as the number of cows.

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can write two equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \) (since there are 20 animals in total)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we first need to calculate the total number of slices from the 7 pizzas. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people sharing the pizzas. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each person can have 14 slices.
