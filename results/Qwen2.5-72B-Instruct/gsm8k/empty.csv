"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the house including the purchase price and the repairs.
2. Determine the new value of the house after the repairs.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the house.**

The purchase price of the house is $80,000, and the cost of repairs is $50,000. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the new value of the house after the repairs.**

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. To find the new value, we first need to calculate 150% of the original value of the house (which is $80,000).

150% of $80,000 is:
\[ 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is the original value plus the increase:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**

The profit is the new value of the house minus the total cost:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed required for the day for all chickens.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily requirement.

First, we calculate the total daily feed requirement for 20 chickens:
- Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day.
- For 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) cups.

Next, we calculate the total amount of feed already given:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups.
- The total feed given so far is \( 15 + 25 = 40 \) cups.

Finally, we find out how many cups of feed are needed for the final meal:
- Total daily requirement: 60 cups
- Feed already given: 40 cups
- Feed needed for the final meal: \( 60 - 40 = 20 \) cups

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of 16 glasses, where every second glass is sold at a 60% discount.

1. The cost of one glass is $5.
2. The cost of every second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.

Now, let's break down the purchase:
- For 16 glasses, there are 8 pairs of glasses.
- In each pair, the first glass costs $5 and the second glass costs $3.

The total cost for one pair of glasses is:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there are 8 pairs:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay:

"Let's denote the number of sheep in Seattle as \( S \), in Charleston as \( C \), and in Toulouse as \( T \).

Given:
- Seattle has 20 sheep, so \( S = 20 \).
- Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so \( C = 4S \).
- Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so \( T = 2C \).

First, calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:
\[ C = 4S = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:
\[ T = 2C = 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Now, add the number of sheep in all three cities:
\[ S + C + T = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 \]

The total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the 200 GB file.
2. Add the time taken for the Windows restart.
3. Add the time to download the full 200 GB file again.

First, calculate 40% of the 200 GB file:
\[ 0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB} \]

Next, calculate the time to download 80 GB at a rate of 2 GB/minute:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, add the 20 minutes for the Windows restart:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, add the time to download the full 200 GB file again:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Total time:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \text{ minutes} \]

"First, let's calculate the distance John initially travels away from home. He drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how far he travels back home during the 4 hours. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time. 

For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After the half-hour, he drives the remaining time (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances he traveled back home:

\[ \text{Total distance back home} = 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we subtract the distance he traveled back home from the initial distance he traveled away from home:

\[ \text{Distance from home} = 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider both her regular pay and her overtime pay.

1. **Calculate the regular pay:**
   - Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour.
   - She worked 40 hours at this rate.
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Calculate the overtime pay:**
   - Eliza worked 45 hours in total, so she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours of overtime.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the green house:**
   Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is \( \frac{x}{3} \).

2. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the green house:**
   After selling at the green house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

3. **Vacuum cleaners sold at the red house:**
   Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house.

4. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the red house:**
   After selling at the red house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:

   Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

6. **Vacuum cleaners remaining after the orange house:**
   After selling at the orange house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

7. **Solving for \( x \):**
   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we first need to calculate the total time she should take to complete the 12-mile trail.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given:
- Total Distance = 12 miles
- Desired Average Speed = 4 miles per hour

We can rearrange the formula to solve for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles (1 hour for the first 4 miles and another hour for the next 2 miles). Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the trail is:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to walk is:
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"First, let's determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in it is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

Next, since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, the remaining amount of orange drink is:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Now, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in it is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

When the remaining 9 liters of orange drink are mixed with the 15 liters of pineapple drink, the total volume of the mixture is:
\[ 9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water in the 24 liters of the mixture is the sum of the water from the orange drink and the water from the pineapple drink:
\[ 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

2. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in a week.

First, we calculate the total hours per day:
- Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of.
- John has 10 dogs.

So, the total hours per day is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours per week:
- There are 7 days in a week.

So, the total hours per week is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"First, we need to determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Next, we add 5 to this amount to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

So, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

\[
23

"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes and then add them to the points he scored in the first 20 minutes.

1. Points scored in the first 20 minutes: 4 points.
2. Points scored in the second 20 minutes: 25% more than the first 20 minutes.

First, calculate 25% of 4 points:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the points scored in the second 20 minutes:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Now, add the points from both periods:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine the cost per yogurt.
3. Calculate the total cost for the number of yogurts he eats in 30 days.

Step 1: Total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Step 2: Cost per yogurt
The yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is:
\[ \frac{5.00 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ yogurts}} = 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} \]

Step 3: Total cost for 60 yogurts
The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
\[ 60 \text{ yogurts} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} = 75.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:
\[ 75.00 \]

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed. Speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time.

First, let's determine the total time John spends running each week.

- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

So, the total time he spends running each week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles a week.

Now, we can calculate his average speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds, and then calculate the distance she can travel in six hours given the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

18"
"If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, then Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old. Since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, Brandon’s iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

"When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than her normal throwing distance. Normally, she can throw the javelin 400 feet. Therefore, with the gemstone, she can throw it:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's flame reach from the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we first need to determine the total number of pie pieces available initially. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pie pieces is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces remaining} = 26 \text{ pieces taken} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

"First, let's determine the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips. Since there are 5 servings in the bag and each serving has 250 calories, the total number of calories in the bag is:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily target of 2000 calories. You have already consumed 1800 calories, so the remaining calories you can consume are:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories. Since each serving (which is 250 calories) is part of a 300g bag, we can find the number of grams per calorie:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} \]

Therefore, the number of grams you can eat for 200 calories is:

\[ 200 \text{ calories} \times 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount of beeswax needed:**
   - Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax.
   - To make 20 candles, he needs \( \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \).

2. **Calculate the total cost of beeswax and wicks:**
   - One pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00.
   - For 2 pounds of beeswax, the total cost is \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \).

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the candles:**
   - Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
   - For 20 candles, the total revenue is \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Net profit = \( 40 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice used.
2. Calculate the number of Post-it notes she had initially plus the number in the package.
3. Subtract the number of Post-it notes remaining from the total to find the number in the package.

First, we know that Candice placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. So, she used 220 Post-it notes.

Next, we know that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining after using 220. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes she had before using them is:
\[ 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased. The total number of Post-it notes she had before using them is the sum of the Post-it notes she initially had and the Post-it notes in the package:
\[ 80 + x = 243 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 243 - 80 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased is:

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

\[
\text{Total spent on red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, the total amount spent on all ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

\[
\text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"First, we need to determine how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Sarah's laundry} = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:

\[ 400 = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Solving for David's laundry:

\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how much laundry Raymond does. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Sarah's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The team played 22 games in total, so \( W + L = 22 \).
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost, so \( W = L + 8 \).

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, we can find \( W \) using the second equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking.
2. Calculate how many cans of tomatoes were used.
3. Convert the number of cans into the number of tomatoes.

First, since the volume of the tomatoes is halved when cooked into sauce, the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking must have been twice the volume of the sauce. Freda made 32 ounces of sauce, so the initial volume of tomatoes was:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes were used to get 64 ounces of tomatoes. Since each can contains 16 ounces:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Originally, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drive through in the first 15 minutes.
3. 20 more cars drive through in the remaining 15 minutes.
4. 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

Let \( x \) be the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5 (those that took the exit).

The total number of cars initially is 30, so the equation is:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 5 \).

"First, let's determine the total number of potted plants Mary has initially. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, she received 18 new potted plants from the nursery, so the total number of potted plants she has now is:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. Therefore, she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Thus, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, so the remaining number of pages is:

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read 6 pages per day on average.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box and then find the volume of one box. Finally, we multiply that volume by 3 to get the total volume for all 3 boxes.

1. **Calculate the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) inches
   - Inner width: \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) inches
   - Inner height: \( 4 - 2 = 2 \) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - Inner volume = Inner length × Inner width × Inner height
   - Inner volume = \( 3 \) inches × \( 4 \) inches × \( 2 \) inches
   - Inner volume = \( 24 \) cubic inches

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box × 3
   - Total inner volume = \( 24 \) cubic inches × 3
   - Total inner volume = \( 72 \) cubic inches

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can start by calculating the total time he spent watching TV from Monday to Friday, excluding Wednesday.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Adding these up:
1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week. Therefore, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes

Thus, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of water that entered Julia's boat while she was rowing back to shore.

First, let's find out how far Julia rowed in 64 seconds. We know that it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, her rowing speed is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance she rowed in 64 seconds:
\[ \text{Distance} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to determine how much water entered the boat for every 10 feet she rowed. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet. Therefore, for 80 feet, the amount of water that entered the boat is:
\[ \text{Water} = \left(\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water that entered the boat by the time Julia reached shore is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's break down the information given:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

First, let's find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can set up the equation:
\[ \text{Number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold} = \frac{\text{Number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold}}{6} \]
\[ \text{Number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we know that the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. Let \( d \) represent the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. We can set up the equation:
\[ 300 = 50d \]

To find \( d \), we solve for \( d \):
\[ d = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo is:
\[ 6 \]"
"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue she will make from selling it at the new price.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- She has 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10, each costing $10.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]
- She has 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10, each costing $16.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]
- The total cost of all the lumber is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the selling price of the lumber, which has increased by 50%:
- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15/\text{board}
  \]
- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24/\text{board}
  \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the lumber:
- Revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]
- Revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]
- The total revenue is:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270
  \]

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
  \[
  \$270 - \$180 = \$90

"First, let's determine Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

Given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, we can write:

\[ 40000 = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]
\[ 40000 = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = 30769.23 \]

Next, we calculate Adrien's salary four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Now, we calculate Lylah's salary four years later. Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, we need to find the percentage increase in Adrien's salary and apply it to Lylah's salary. Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add the new salaries of Adrien and Lylah to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:

\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

Thus, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

"To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he completed in the given time for each test and then find the difference between the total number of questions and the completed ones.

First, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the first test:
- Mark's rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 8 hours

\[ \text{Questions completed in the first test} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{questions} \]

The first test had 75 questions, so the number of questions left incomplete in the first test is:
\[ 75 \, \text{questions} - 40 \, \text{questions} = 35 \, \text{questions} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the second test:
- Mark's rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 6 hours

\[ \text{Questions completed in the second test} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{questions} \]

The second test had 100 questions, so the number of questions left incomplete in the second test is:
\[ 100 \, \text{questions} - 30 \, \text{questions} = 70 \, \text{questions} \]

Finally, the total number of questions left incomplete is the sum of the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ 35 \, \text{questions} + 70 \, \text{questions} = 105 \, \text{questions} \]

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees 1/2 that many bees return.
   - Number of bees returning = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave.
   - Number of bees leaving = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive.
   - Bees that left initially and haven't returned yet = 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
   - Bees that left in the third 6-hour period and haven't returned yet = 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours = 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) = 75 bees.

"To find out how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating the tires for all the vehicles that came by.

1. Bicycles have 2 tires each. If 5 people came by to get both tires inflated, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is:
   \(5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires per bicycle} = 10 \text{ tires}\)

2. Tricycles have 3 tires each. If 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is:
   \(3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires per tricycle} = 9 \text{ tires}\)

3. A unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person came by to get their unicycle tire inflated, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is:
   \(1 \text{ unicycle} \times 1 \text{ tire per unicycle} = 1 \text{ tire}\)

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is:
\(10 \text{ tires} + 9 \text{ tires} + 1 \text{ tire} = 20 \text{ tires}\)

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, so the total cost is:
\(20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents per tire} = 500 \text{ cents}\)

Since 100 cents make a dollar, the total amount in dollars is:

"Let's denote the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries:
   \[
   x - 14
   \]

2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 7 fries:
   \[
   x - 14 - 7 = x - 21
   \]

3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries:
   \[
   x - 21 - (3 \times 3) = x - 21 - 9 = x - 30
   \]

4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries:
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries before raccoon} = x - 30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Fries taken by raccoon} = \frac{2}{3} (x - 30)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries after raccoon} = (x - 30) - \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) = \frac{1}{3} (x - 30)
   \]

5. Ants carried off one fry:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1
   \]

6. Five fries were left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5

"To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in class each week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- He has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long.
- Therefore, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours each of these days.

Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total number of hours spent in class on these days is:
\[3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ hours}\]

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- He has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long.
- Therefore, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours each of these days.

Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total number of hours spent in class on these days is:
\[2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ hours}\]

Now, we add the hours spent in class on all the days of the week:
\[9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours per week}\]

2. Determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get 45 eggs.
   - Each time Sandra babysits, she receives 9 eggs.
   - To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session.
   - \( \frac{45}{9} = 5 \)

So, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times.

"Let's denote Seth's current age as \( S \) and Brooke's current age as \( B \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 8 \) back into \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the hat**: The hat costs $25.
2. **Cost of the jacket**: The jacket costs three times as much as the hat. Therefore, the cost of the jacket is:
   \[
   3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the pants**: The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as:
   \[
   \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
\[
25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost of each uniform is:
\[

"To determine how much Jessica will pay in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum on all her debts, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payment and then find 50% more than that amount.

1. Calculate the total minimum monthly payment:
   - Student loans: $300
   - Credit card: $200
   - Mortgage: $500

   Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

2. Calculate 50% more than the total minimum monthly payment:
   - 50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

   Total monthly payment with 50% more = $1000 + $500 = $1500

3. Calculate the total annual payment:
   - Total monthly payment = $1500
   - Number of months in a year = 12

   Total annual payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

Therefore, Jessica will pay $18000 in a year.

"To find out how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the total time for peeling and cutting all 60 potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time for peeling:
- It takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total peeling time is \( 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, let's calculate the time for cutting:
- It takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total cutting time is \( 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \).

Convert the cutting time to minutes:
- \( 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \).

Now, add the peeling and cutting times together:
- Total time = 90 minutes (peeling) + 5 minutes (cutting) = 95 minutes.

So, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is 95 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, given their profit and the costs involved.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They made a profit of $25.
   - Let \( P \) be the profit, \( R \) be the total revenue, and \( C \) be the total cost.
   - The profit formula is: \( P = R - C \).
   - Given \( P = 25 \), we can rewrite the formula as: \( R = P + C \).

2. **Determine the total cost:**
   - The cost to make one gallon of lemonade is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, which totals $5 per gallon.
   - Let \( G \) be the number of gallons they made.
   - The total cost \( C \) is \( 5G \).

3. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon.
   - The revenue per gallon is \( 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \) dollars.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( J \) be Jean's age.
   - Let \( M \) be Mark's age.
   - Jan's age is given as 30.

2. **Set up the equations based on the information given:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark: \( J = M + 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age:
     - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
     - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
     - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
     - Therefore, \( M - 2 = 14 + 5 \).

3. **Solve the second equation:**
   - \( M - 2 = 19 \)
   - \( M = 19 + 2 \)
   - \( M = 21 \)

4. **Use the first equation to find Jean's age:**
   - \( J = M + 2 \)

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then determine how much more likely one event is compared to the other, expressed as a percentage.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
We need to find the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

Thus, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of rats in each cage. Let's break down the information given:

1. **Rats:**
   - Rats are kept in 3 cages.
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.

2. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Since each cage has one hamster, the total number of hamsters is 10.

3. **Rabbits:**
   - 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

4. **Total straw distributed:**
   - The total number of pieces of straw distributed is 160.

We can set up the equation for the total straw distributed as follows:
\[ \text{Total straw} = (\text{straw for rats}) + (\text{straw for hamsters}) + (\text{straw for rabbits}) \]

First, calculate the straw for the hamsters:
\[ \text{Straw for hamsters} = 10 \text{ hamsters} \times 5 \text{ pieces/hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, calculate the straw for the rabbits:
\[ \text{Straw for rabbits} = 20 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, let's express the straw for the rats in terms of \( r \):
\[ \text{Straw for rats} = 3 \text{ cages} \times r \text{ rats/cage} \times 6 \text{ pieces/rat} = 18r \text{ pieces} \]

Using the total straw distributed:
\[ 160 = 18r + 50 + 20 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 160 = 18r + 70 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides:
\[ 90 = 18r \]

Divide both sides by 18:
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To find out how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

1. First, we know that Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher. Since he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

2. Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
   \[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

3. Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, which is 10 cents per sentence. Therefore, for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
   \[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

4. To find the total earnings, we add the earnings from both publishers:
   \[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

"To determine how much money John made in the year after winning the award, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the increased salary due to the 5% raise.

1. **Calculate the one-time monetary reward:**
   - John receives a one-time monetary reward of $5000.

2. **Calculate John's original annual salary:**
   - John makes $2000 per week.
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Original annual salary = $2000 * 52 = $104,000.

3. **Calculate the new weekly salary after the 5% raise:**
   - 5% of $2000 = 0.05 * $2000 = $100.
   - New weekly salary = $2000 + $100 = $2100.

4. **Calculate the new annual salary with the raise:**
   - New annual salary = $2100 * 52 = $109,200.

5. **Calculate the total money John made in the year:**
   - Total money = One-time monetary reward + New annual salary
   - Total money = $5000 + $109,200 = $114,200.

Therefore, the total amount of money John made that year is:

"To find out how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year.
2. Convert the total tons of grapes into barrels of wine.

First, we calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year:
- Josie has a 10-acre farm.
- Each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year.

Total tons of grapes = 10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Next, we convert the total tons of grapes into barrels of wine:
- Each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine.

Total barrels of wine = 50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

Therefore, the farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, we can break down the problem into parts:

1. **Cheese used for sandwiches:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese for sandwiches: \( 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Cheese used for omelets:**
   - Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than each sandwich, so each omelet used \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Cheese used for macaroni and cheese:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese.

Now, we add up all the cheese used:

"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

For the first four weeks:
- Micheal rides 5 times a week.
- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- Total kilometers per week = 5 rides/week * 25 km/ride = 125 km/week.
- Total kilometers for four weeks = 125 km/week * 4 weeks = 500 km.

For the next three weeks:
- Micheal rides 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- Total kilometers per week = 2 rides/week * 60 km/ride = 120 km/week.
- Total kilometers for three weeks = 120 km/week * 3 weeks = 360 km.

Adding the two parts together:
- Total kilometers = 500 km + 360 km = 860 km.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

1. **Weight of the chocolate bars:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs 40g.
   - Joe has 25 chocolate bars.
   - Total weight of the chocolate bars = 25 chocolate bars * 40g per chocolate bar = 1000g.

2. **Weight of the candied apples:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.
   - Therefore, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g.
   - Joe has 80 candied apples.
   - Total weight of the candied apples = 80 candied apples * 20g per candied apple = 1600g.

3. **Total weight of the bag:**

"To find out how many cakes Rose bought after all three days, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and then sum them up.

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. This means:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ cakes}
   \]
3. On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. This means:
   \[
   5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ cakes}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of each cup. Let's break down the information given:

1. Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
2. Each plate costs $6000.

First, calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:
\[ \text{Total cost of half a dozen plates} = 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \]

Next, determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:
\[ \text{Cost of twenty dozen cups} = 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

Now, convert twenty dozen cups to the number of individual cups:
\[ 20 \text{ dozen} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Finally, calculate the cost of each cup:
\[ \text{Cost per cup} = \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \]

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is:

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the additional amount she needs is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her total earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her savings:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Sara still needs:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn:
\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day.
2. The white chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

We can set up the equation for the total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substitute \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the total distance he walks, which is the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substitute the values for \( d \) and \( v \):

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the first day.
2. Calculate the number of customers on the second day.
3. Use the total number of customers over the three days to find the number of customers on the third day.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

Next, on the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

The total number of customers over the three days is 500. We can set up the equation to find the number of customers on the third day:
\[ 100 + 150 + x = 500 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 250 + x = 500 \]
\[ x = 500 - 250 \]
\[ x = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:
\[ 250 \]"
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

Given that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons) and the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay back. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount.

The additional 10% of $2000 is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she needs to pay back is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount she will pay over 12 months if she pays $165 each month:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to pay back to find the remaining balance:

   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
1. Harriet's age in three years:
   \[

"To determine how many vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate the total number of tomatoes he and his girlfriend consume per week.

1. Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day.
2. There are 7 days in a week, so Steve eats \( 6 \times 7 = 42 \) tomatoes per week.
3. Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, so his girlfriend eats \( \frac{42}{2} = 21 \) tomatoes per week.
4. Together, they eat \( 42 + 21 = 63 \) tomatoes per week.

Next, we need to determine how many vines are required to produce 63 tomatoes per week.

5. Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.
6. Therefore, the number of vines needed is \( \frac{63}{3} = 21 \).

So, Steve needs 21 vines.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider how many new pens Ram can create from the empty ones and how many total pens he can use.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **First Batch of New Pens**: From the 25 empty pens, he can make 5 new pens (since 5 empty pens make 1 full pen).
3. **Second Batch of New Pens**: After using these 5 new pens, he will have 5 more empty pens, which he can use to make 1 more full pen.
4. **Final Count**: After using this last pen, he will have 1 more empty pen, but he won't have enough to make another full pen.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to use is the sum of the initial pens, the first batch of new pens, and the second batch of new pens.

25 (initial) + 5 (first batch) + 1 (second batch) = 31

"First, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit A:
30% of 1000 students = 0.30 * 1000 = 300 students

Next, we find the number of students remaining after 300 students left through exit A:
1000 - 300 = 700 students

Then, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B:
3/5 of the remaining 700 students = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students

Finally, we find the number of students who went out through exit C by subtracting the number of students who went out through exits A and B from the total:
1000 - 300 - 420 = 280 students

"To determine how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pen pals Mike still has.
2. Determine the total number of letters he receives each week.
3. Calculate the total number of pages he needs to write in response.
4. Determine the total time he spends writing these pages.
5. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of pen pals Mike still has.**
Mike originally had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \]
So, Mike still has 3 pen pals.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of letters he receives each week.**
Each of his 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week.
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]
So, Mike receives 6 letters each week.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of pages he needs to write in response.**
Each letter is 5 pages long, and Mike responds in kind.
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \]
So, Mike needs to write 30 pages each week.

**Step 4: Determine the total time he spends writing these pages.**
Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.
\[ 30 \times 6 = 180 \]
So, Mike spends 180 minutes writing each week.

**Step 5: Convert the total time from minutes to hours.**
There are 60 minutes in an hour.
\[ \frac{180}{60} = 3 \]
So, Mike spends 3 hours writing each week.

"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total minutes he has used and subtract that from his monthly allowance.

1. **Daily calls with the boss:**
   - Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day.
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - Total minutes for calls with the boss: \( 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Extra calls to other people:**
   - Jason has used an additional 300 minutes for calls to other people.

3. **Total minutes used:**
   - Total minutes used = Minutes for calls with the boss + Extra minutes
   - Total minutes used = \( 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Minutes remaining:**
   - Jason's monthly allowance is 1000 minutes.
   - Minutes remaining = Monthly allowance - Total minutes used
   - Minutes remaining = \( 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \).

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial fries Griffin had:**
   Griffin started with 24 fries.

2. **Fries taken by Kyle:**
   Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   24 - 5 = 19
   \]
   So, Griffin had 19 fries left.

3. **Fries taken by Billy:**
   Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle.
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
   So, Billy took 10 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   19 - 10 = 9
   \]
   Now, Griffin had 9 fries left.

4. **Fries given by Ginger:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin.

5. **Fries taken by Colby:**
   Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took.
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2
   \]
   So, Colby took 2 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
   Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree.

First, we calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it. The tree is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Time to heat oil to 300 degrees:** 20 minutes.
2. **Time to heat oil from 300 to 400 degrees:** 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees.

To find 40% of 20 minutes:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the time to heat from 300 to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

3. **Total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees:**
\[ 20 + 28 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

4. **Time to cook the chicken:** 5 minutes less than the time to warm up the oil.

So, the time to cook the chicken is:
\[ 48 - 5 = 43 \text{ minutes} \]

5. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:**
\[ 48 + 43 = 91 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time is:

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to break down the total number of stitches used for the sweater and then solve for the sleeves.

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \]

The total project is 1800 stitches, so the remaining stitches for the two sleeves are:
\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:
\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \]

Each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and this is twice as many as a mamba, we can set up the equation:

\[ 70 = 2 \times \text{(number of spots on a mamba)} \]

Solving for the number of spots on a mamba:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, and 60 mambas, each with 35 spots. The total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

The total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much money Elise earned in the second year, we need to determine how many books she sold in each year and then calculate the earnings for the second year.

1. **Determine the number of books sold in the current year:**
   - The current year's sales are given as 45 books.

2. **Determine the number of books sold in the first year:**
   - She sold twice as many books in the first year as in the current year.
   - First year's sales = 2 * 45 = 90 books.

3. **Determine the total number of books sold over the three years:**
   - Total books initially = 250 books.
   - Unsold books = 50 books.
   - Books sold = 250 - 50 = 200 books.

4. **Determine the number of books sold in the second year:**
   - Books sold in the first year = 90 books.
   - Books sold in the current year = 45 books.
   - Books sold in the second year = Total books sold - (Books sold in the first year + Books sold in the current year)
   - Books sold in the second year = 200 - (90 + 45) = 200 - 135 = 65 books.

5. **Calculate the earnings for the second year:**
   - Each book sells for $20.
   - Earnings in the second year = 65 books * $20/book = $1300.

"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from both his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

1. **Calculate the number of working days in April:**
   - April typically has 30 days.
   - Watson works 5 days a week.
   - Number of weeks in April: \( \frac{30}{7} \approx 4.29 \) weeks.
   - Since Watson works 5 days each week, the total number of working days in April is \( 4.29 \times 5 \approx 21.45 \) days.
   - Since he can't work a fraction of a day, we round down to 21 days.

2. **Calculate Watson's earnings from his hourly wage:**
   - Watson works 10 hours each day.
   - His hourly wage is $10.
   - Total hours worked in April: \( 21 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ hours/day} = 210 \text{ hours} \).
   - Total earnings from hourly wage: \( 210 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 2100 \text{ dollars} \).

3. **Calculate Watson's weekly bonus:**
   - Watson receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.
   - Number of weeks in April: 4 weeks.
   - Total bonus for April: \( 4 \text{ weeks} \times 300 \text{ dollars/week} = 1200 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Calculate Watson's total earnings for April:**
   - Total earnings from hourly wage: $2100.
   - Total bonus: $1200.
   - Total earnings: \( 2100 \text{ dollars} + 1200 \text{ dollars} = 3300 \text{ dollars} \).

"To solve the problem, we first determine how many loaves are sold in the morning:

- The bakery produces 60 loaves each day.
- Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \) loaves.

Next, we calculate how many loaves are left after the morning sales:

- Total loaves produced: 60
- Loaves sold in the morning: 40
- Loaves remaining: \( 60 - 40 = 20 \) loaves.

Then, we determine how many loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. Half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening:

- Half of the remaining loaves: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \) loaves.
- These 10 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, so each period sells: \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) loaves.

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week and then calculate how long it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight, given her rate.

1. First, find out how much weight Joey loses in one week:
   Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so in one week, Joey loses:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

2. Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

3. To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we need to calculate:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per 4 weeks}} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ weeks}
   \]

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

   - In 15 days, the number of new arms is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

2. **Calculate the number of new legs:**
   - A person grows an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of new legs is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

3. **Calculate the total number of new limbs:**
   - Total new limbs = Number of new arms + Number of new legs
   - Total new limbs = 5 + 3 = 8

Thus, after 15 days, the person will have grown 8 new limbs.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 suits * $100/suit = $600

Next, the total cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150

Now, the cost of the flight ticket:
$700 + (5 * $100) = $700 + $500 = $1200

Adding up all the expenses so far:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight) = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the total amount he plans to spend and save is:
$6000 (total money) - $2000 (savings) = $4000

Subtracting the expenses from the amount he plans to spend:
$4000 - $1950 = $2050

Therefore, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners.

"To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, we first need to calculate the daily egg consumption and then multiply that by 7 (the number of days in a week).

1. **Daily Egg Consumption:**
   - Three people eat 3 eggs each day: \(3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person} = 9 \text{ eggs}\)
   - Two people eat 2 eggs each day: \(2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person} = 4 \text{ eggs}\)
   - Total daily consumption: \(9 \text{ eggs} + 4 \text{ eggs} = 13 \text{ eggs}\)

2. **Weekly Egg Consumption:**
   - Total daily consumption: 13 eggs
   - Number of days in a week: 7

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Currently, Cera is 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Therefore, \(60000 = \frac{P}{2}\).
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The current population of Chile is \(120000\).

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can set up the equation:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ \text{number of pencils per box} = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

1. **Cooling by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we calculate the number of ice cubes needed:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}

     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Weakening by Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To find out how many guns each person would have if they shared them equally, we first need to calculate the total number of guns they have together. 

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. Adding these together:

8 (DJ) + 10 (Nick) + 1 (RJ) + 5 (Richard) = 24 guns in total.

There are 4 people, so we divide the total number of guns by 4 to find out how many guns each person would have if they were shared equally:

24 guns ÷ 4 people = 6 guns per person.

"To find out how much sugar Mason needs, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. Calculate the amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers.
2. Calculate the amount of sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge.

For the suckers:
- Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for one batch.
- For 8 batches, he needs \( 30 \times 8 = 240 \) ounces of sugar.

For the fudge:
- Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar for one batch.

Adding these together:
- Total sugar needed = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge
- Total sugar needed = 240 + 70 = 310 ounces

Therefore, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar in total.

"First, we calculate the initial total cost of the shares:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8 \text{ per share} = \$64 \]

Next, we determine the value of the shares after the first year when the stock price increases by 50%:
\[ \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \text{ per share} \]
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12 \text{ per share} = \$96 \]

Then, we calculate the value of the shares after the second year when the stock price decreases by 25%:
\[ \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \text{ per share} \]
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9 \text{ per share} = \$72 \]

The final value of all Maria's shares is:

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group, therefore, has \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Add 10 to both sides:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

The number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Thus, the number of students in the smallest group is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chickens and cows Farmer Brown has, and then calculate the total number of legs.

1. Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \).
2. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is \( 2C \).
3. The total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   C + 2C = 60
   \]
4. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   3C = 60
   \]
5. Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = \frac{60}{3} = 20
   \]
6. Therefore, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

Next, we calculate the total number of legs:
- Each cow has 4 legs, so the total number of legs for the cows is \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \).
- Each chicken has 2 legs, so the total number of legs for the chickens is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \).

Adding these together, the total number of legs is:
\[
80 + 80 = 160
\]

Thus, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160.

"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can determine the weights of the other animals based on the information provided:

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, so both the blue beetle and the green toad also weigh 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June after taking his coach's advice, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson needs to run each day.
2. Add this additional distance to his original daily distance.
3. Multiply the new daily distance by the number of days in June.

First, we calculate the additional distance Tyson needs to run each day:
\[ \text{Additional distance} = \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 \text{ meters} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we add this additional distance to his original daily distance:
\[ \text{New daily distance} = 5000 \text{ meters} + 1000 \text{ meters} = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

June has 30 days, so we multiply the new daily distance by 30:
\[ \text{Total distance in June} = 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Thus, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:

"To find out how much Ethan saved by making his own hand-painted wallpaper, we first need to calculate 20% of the market price of the wallpaper.

20% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

This means Ethan saved $80 by making the wallpaper himself. To find the total cost of making the wallpaper, we subtract the savings from the market price:

\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

So, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

"To find out how many tennis shoes were sold by the end of the sale, we need to calculate the number of pairs sold each day and then account for the returns.

1. **Friday**: The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. **Saturday**: The store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday, which is \( 14 \times 2 = 28 \) pairs.
3. **Sunday**: The store sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday, which is \( 28 \div 2 = 14 \) pairs. However, 6 pairs were returned, so the net sales for Sunday are \( 14 - 6 = 8 \) pairs.

Now, we sum up the pairs sold over the three days:
- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

Total pairs sold = \( 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \) pairs.

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is:
\( 50 \times 2 = 100 \) shoes.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of pupils who like blue.
2. Calculate the number of pupils remaining after those who like blue are accounted for.
3. Find out how many of the remaining pupils like green.
4. Calculate the number of pupils who like yellow by subtracting the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils.

Let's start with step 1:
- There are 40 pupils in total.
- Half of the class likes blue, so the number of pupils who like blue is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).

Next, step 2:
- The remaining number of pupils is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

For step 3:
- One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so the number of pupils who like green is \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \).

Finally, step 4:
- The number of pupils who like yellow is the remaining number of pupils after accounting for those who like blue and green, which is \( 20 - 5 = 15 \).

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total interest she will pay over the five months and then add this to the principal amount to find the total amount to be repaid. Finally, we divide this total by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

1. **Calculate the total interest:**
   The formula for simple interest is:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the rate (R) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (T) is 5/12 years (since 5 months is 5/12 of a year).

   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 152.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3802.50
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.50}{5}

"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Since Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, Anna has:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Since Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, Anna has:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos they have together.

Total silver pesos:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Total gold pesos:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos together to get the total number of pesos:

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up the problem as follows:

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially.

He sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, so he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left.

According to the problem, the amount of land he has left is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

\[
x = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"First, we determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we calculate:

Number of boys = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26
Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

The performance is with just the female members, so initially, there are 26 girls performing.

On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can make it is:

Number of girls who can make it = 0.5 * 26 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people = Number of girls who can make it + Number of teachers
Total number of people = 13 + 3 = 16

     900 \text{ watts} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 2700 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]

3. Calculate the daily energy savings:
   - The daily energy savings is the difference between the original daily usage and the new daily usage:
     \[
     7200 \text{ watt-hours} - 2700 \text{ watt-hours} = 4500 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]

4. Convert the daily energy savings to kilowatt-hours:
   - Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 watt-hours, the daily energy savings in kilowatt-hours is:
     \[
     \frac{4500 \text{ watt-hours}}{1000} = 4.5 \text{ kWh}
     \]

5. Calculate the total energy savings over 30 days:
   - The total energy savings over 30 days is:
     \[
     4.5 \text{ kWh/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ kWh}
     \]

Therefore, the total energy savings in 30 days is 135 kilowatt-hours.

"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

1. Calculate the total number of stripes:
   - Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\)
   - One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\)
   - One zebra with half the number of stripes as the 36-striped zebra: \(36 / 2 = 18\)

2. Add up all the stripes:
   \[
   34 + 36 + 18 = 88
   \]

3. Count the total number of zebras:
   \[
   2 + 1 + 1 = 4
   \]

4. Calculate the average number of stripes:
   \[
   \frac{88}{4} = 22
   \]

The average number of stripes on the zebras is 22.

"To determine how much Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sandwiches needed:
   - There are 20 people, and each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - Number of sandwiches = 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches.

2. Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed:
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - Total meat needed = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds.
   - Total cheese needed = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds.

3. Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese:
   - Cost of meat = 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.
   - Cost of cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.

4. Calculate the total cost:
   - Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

Therefore, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"First, we determine the initial number of corns and cannolis at Allan's house. According to the problem, Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis.

1. Calculate the initial number of corns:
   \[
   \text{Initial number of corns} = 2 \times \text{Initial number of cannolis} = 2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

2. Allan then buys 60 more cannolis:
   \[
   \text{New number of cannolis} = 40 + 60 = 100
   \]

3. Allan also buys 40 fewer corns than the new number of cannolis:
   \[
   \text{New number of corns} = 100 - 40 = 60
   \]

4. Finally, we find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:
   \[
   \text{Combined total} = \text{New number of corns} + \text{New number of cannolis} = 60 + 100 = 160
   \]

Thus, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

"Elliott's total goal is 10,000 steps. He completed half of his steps to and from school, which is 5,000 steps. He also did 1,000 steps on a short walk with his friend. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. 

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we can calculate the total steps he had taken before the jog and subtract this from the total steps he had left to reach his goal after the jog.

Steps taken before the jog:
5,000 (to and from school) + 1,000 (with his friend) = 6,000 steps

Steps left after the jog: 2,000

Total steps taken before the jog + steps taken during the jog + steps left after the jog = 10,000
6,000 + steps during jog + 2,000 = 10,000

Solving for the steps during the jog:
6,000 + steps during jog + 2,000 = 10,000
8,000 + steps during jog = 10,000
steps during jog = 10,000 - 8,000
steps during jog = 2,000

Therefore, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

"First, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words per page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we determine how long it will take Toby to read the book:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words per minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, and it takes 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, the total time he needs to leave by is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Toby will finish reading the book in 30 minutes, he will have:
\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Toby will be 20 minutes early.

"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to calculate the payments for each month and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**
- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per week: 40
- Weeks in a month: 4 (assuming a standard 4-week month)

Total payment for one employee in May:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in May:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 40 \, \text{employees} = 96000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total payment for June.**
- Number of employees in June: 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees remained.
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \, \text{employees} \]

Total payment for one employee in June:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in June:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 30 \, \text{employees} = 72000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for both months.**
\[ 96000 \, \text{dollars} + 72000 \, \text{dollars} = 168000 \, \text{dollars} \]

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means the first pound costs $3, and the second pound costs $3 * 1/2 = $1.50.

The total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixed bag of seashells:
\[ 1.50 \]

Then, let's calculate the cost of the 4 magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, so:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from $10:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog.

1. First, we calculate the number of candles that are expected to explode. Since Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, the probability of a candle exploding is 1% (or 0.01).

   \[
   \text{Number of exploding candles} = 0.01 \times 50000 = 500
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many of these exploding candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. We know that 5% of the more dangerous (exploding) candles have this defect.

   \[
   \text{Number of exploding candles that smell like wet dog} = 0.05 \times 500 = 25

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \( x \).

Now, for her sister:
1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. Her sister gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads (each animal has one head):
   \[
   C + D = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps (camels have 2 humps, dromedaries have 1 hump):
   \[
   2C + D = 304
   \]

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[
D = 180 - C
\]

Next, substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[
2C + (180 - C) = 304
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2C + 180 - C = 304
\]
\[
C + 180 = 304
\]
\[
C = 304 - 180
\]
\[
C = 124
\]

Now, substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the equation \( D = 180 - C \):
\[
D = 180 - 124
\]
\[
D = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

"To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the trip into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Distance per day: 200 kilometers
   - Total distance for 4 days: \( 200 \times 4 = 800 \) kilometers

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: 800 kilometers
   - Distance for the next 2 days: \( 30\% \) of 800 kilometers
   - \( 30\% \) of 800 kilometers: \( 0.30 \times 800 = 240 \) kilometers

3. **Next 1 day:**
   - Distance traveled: 0 kilometers (he wasn't traveling at all)

4. **Second week (7 days):**
   - Distance per day: 300 kilometers
   - Total distance for 7 days: \( 300 \times 7 = 2100 \) kilometers

Now, we sum up the distances from all segments:
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next 2 days: 240 kilometers
- Next 1 day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance traveled:
\[ 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. Therefore, Zack's locker is 4 times the size of Peter's locker:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, Timothy's locker is twice the size of Zack's locker:

"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to determine the elevation of the comb after it fell and then calculate the difference between this elevation and Oliver's current elevation.

1. Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
2. The comb fell 4,000 feet: 10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet
3. Oliver's current elevation: 3,000 feet

Now, we calculate the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's elevation:
6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet

Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"First, we start with the initial number of cats on the rock, which is 50.

Four boats came and each carried away 5 cats. So, the total number of cats carried away by the boats is:
4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats

Subtracting the number of cats carried away by the boats from the initial number of cats, we get the number of cats remaining on the rock:
50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats

Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find out how many cats ran after the mouse, we calculate:
3/5 * 30 cats = 18 cats

Subtracting the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats, we get the final number of cats left on the rock:
30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the original prices of the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans, and then find the difference between these original prices.

1. **Determine the sale price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the original prices:**
   - The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the tattered jeans is \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and he saved $2 on them.
   - Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine the difference in original prices:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.

"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted by both the homemade and store-bought bird feeders.

1. **Number of homemade bird feeders**: 3
2. **Number of store-bought bird feeders**: 3
3. **Birds attracted by each store-bought feeder**: 20
4. **Birds attracted by each homemade feeder**: 20 + 10 = 30

Now, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ homemade feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 90 \text{ birds} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ store-bought feeders} \times 20 \text{ birds per feeder} = 60 \text{ birds} \]

Finally, we add the number of birds attracted by both types of feeders to get the total number of birds:
\[ 90 \text{ birds} + 60 \text{ birds} = 150 \text{ birds} \]

Thus, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( C \).

Kenny keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards.

The amount of money he makes from selling the cards is \( \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 \).

He needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 left for spending cash, so he makes a total of $150 from selling the cards.

Setting up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = \frac{150}{1.5} \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = 100 \]
\[ C = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ C = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - Therefore, he prepared \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs for these 18 guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests would each get 1 hotdog, so he prepared \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs for them.
   - In total, he prepared \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Therefore, each of the 40 guests would need 2 hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs needed is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short is \( 80 - 54 = 26 \) hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \( \frac{26}{1} = 26 \) guests.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many gallons of gas are in one container.
2. Calculate how many gallons 1/4 of a container is.
3. Convert the gallons to pints (1 gallon = 8 pints).

First, we divide the total gallons of gas by the number of containers:
\[ \text{Gallons per container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we find out how many gallons 1/4 of a container is:
\[ \text{Gallons for 1/4 of a container} = \frac{3 \text{ gallons}}{4} = 0.75 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we convert the gallons to pints:
\[ \text{Pints} = 0.75 \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints per gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount George spent:**
   - George had $5 initially.
   - He had 1% of his money left, which means he had \( 0.01 \times 5 = 0.05 \) dollars left.
   - Therefore, the amount he spent is \( 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the chips:**
   - George bought 3 bags of chips.
   - Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, or $0.40.
   - The total cost for the chips is \( 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the amount spent on candy bars:**
   - The total amount spent is $4.95.
   - The amount spent on chips is $1.20.
   - The amount spent on candy bars is \( 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the number of candy bars:**
   - Each candy bar costs 75 cents, or $0.75.
   - The number of candy bars George bought is \( \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \).

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Bernadette to reach the theater and then calculate how much earlier she should leave compared to Wayne.

1. **Determine the time it takes for Wayne to reach the theater:**
   - Wayne's drive time: 4 minutes.

2. **Determine the time it takes for Bernadette to reach the theater:**
   - Bernadette's drive time is four times Wayne's drive time.
   - Bernadette's drive time: \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne:**
   - Wayne arrives at the theater at time \( T \).
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to arrive at \( T - 5 \) minutes.
   - Since Bernadette's drive time is 16 minutes, she needs to leave 16 minutes before \( T - 5 \).

4. **Determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave compared to Wayne:**
   - Wayne leaves at time \( T - 4 \) minutes (since his drive time is 4 minutes).
   - Bernadette needs to leave at \( T - 5 - 16 = T - 21 \) minutes.
   - The difference in their departure times is \( (T - 4) - (T - 21) = 17 \) minutes.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room and the length, so we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given:
- The area of the room is 360 square feet.
- The length of the room is 3 yards. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length in feet is \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) feet.

Now, we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the perimeter of the room is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought and then find the difference between these totals.

First, let's calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought:
- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack contains 20 beads.
- Total beads Elizabeth bought = (1 pack of red * 20 beads/pack) + (2 packs of clear * 20 beads/pack) = 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Next, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought:
- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack contains 20 beads.
- Total beads Margareth bought = (3 packs of blue * 20 beads/pack) + (4 packs of red * 20 beads/pack) = 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, we find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:
- Difference = Total beads Margareth bought - Total beads Elizabeth bought = 140 - 60 = 80 beads.

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to Marcus baking. He bakes for 3 hours, and each hour the temperature increases by 5 degrees.

Temperature increase from baking = 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees, so after baking, the temperature is:

Temperature after baking = Initial temperature + Temperature increase from baking
Temperature after baking = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

Next, Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.

Cooling rate = 2 degrees / 10 minutes
Total cooling = Cooling rate * (30 minutes / 10 minutes) = 2 degrees * 3 = 6 degrees

Finally, we subtract the total cooling from the temperature after baking to find the final temperature:

Final temperature = Temperature after baking - Total cooling
Final temperature = 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

Let \( c \) be the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set up the equation:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ c = 6 \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we'll convert the remoras' lengths from inches to feet.

1 foot = 12 inches

Each remora is 6 inches long, so in feet:
6 inches / 12 inches/foot = 0.5 feet

Benny saw 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

The shark's length is 10 feet. The combined length of the remoras is 1 foot. To find the percentage, we use the formula:
(Combined length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100%

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100% = 10%

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times \text{Total number of students} = 20
\]

To find the total number of students, we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
\text{Total number of students} = 20 \times 4 = 80

"To determine how long Jason has to spend walking each day to break in his new shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days Jason has to break in the shoes.
2. Divide the total minutes required by the number of days he can walk.

First, we know that Jason has 3 weeks to break in the shoes. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days in 3 weeks is:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

However, Jason can only walk 4 days a week. Therefore, the total number of days he can walk in 3 weeks is:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes Jason needs to walk each day. The total time required to break in the shoes is 240 minutes. So, we divide the total minutes by the number of days he can walk:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Therefore, Jason has to spend walking each day:

"To solve this problem, we need to use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

1. First, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts:
   - Kids allergic to dairy: 9
   - Kids allergic to peanuts: 6
   - Total: 9 + 6 = 15

2. Since 3 kids are allergic to both, they have been counted twice in the total of 15. We need to subtract these 3 kids to avoid double-counting:
   - Adjusted total: 15 - 3 = 12

3. Now, we know that 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class:
   - Total kids in the class: 32
   - Kids not allergic to anything: 32 - 12 = 20

Therefore, the number of kids not allergic to anything is 20.

"First, let's determine the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we calculate the number of oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we find the total number of oranges they have together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

To determine how many Greek orange pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed for one pie:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Thus, the number of Greek orange pies they can make is:

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Cost of food per guest: $5
- Total cost at the first venue: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest (including food): $25
- Total cost at the second venue: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = 10 \]

Thus, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is:

"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \), by Lily as \( L \), and by Bodhi as \( B \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \)
2. \( L = D + 7 \)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \):
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of the skein they each used and then multiply by the total number of yards in a skein.

First, let's add the fractions of the skein used by Mariah and her grandma:
- Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein.
- Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 4 and 2 is 4.

Convert \( \frac{1}{2} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 4:
\[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4} \]

Now, add the fractions:
\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Next, we need to find out how many yards \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein is. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we multiply \( \frac{3}{4} \) by 364:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

- Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.
- 2 of these packs were strawberry.
- 1 pack was grape, costing $2.
- 1 pack was green apple, costing half as much as the grape pack, so $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of all the gum was $7. We can represent the cost of each strawberry pack as \( S \).

The equation for the total cost is:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]
\[ 2S = 7 - 3 \]
\[ 2S = 4 \]
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

"Let's start by defining the variables and relationships given in the problem.

1. Let \( C_O \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has.
2. Let \( S_O \) be the number of sofas Ophelia has.
3. Let \( C_J \) be the number of chairs Jenna has.
4. Let \( S_J \) be the number of sofas Jenna has.

From the problem, we know:
- Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_O = C_O - 2 \).
- Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia: \( C_J = 3C_O \).
- Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_J = C_J - 2 \).
- Ophelia has 20 sofas: \( S_O = 20 \).

First, we use the information that Ophelia has 20 sofas to find the number of chairs Ophelia has:
\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Next, we find the number of chairs Jenna has:
\[ C_J = 3C_O \]
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]

Now, we find the number of sofas Jenna has:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have:
\[ \text{Total sofas} = S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

   \text{Cost of headphone set} = \$48 - \$4 = \$44
   \]

Next, we need to determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought with the $44 he spent on the headphone set.

4. The cost of one CD is $4.
5. The number of additional CDs Tom could have bought is:
   \[
   \text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{\$44}{\$4} = 11
   \]

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the variations in his routine. Here's the breakdown:

1. Josh spent 4 hours working out each week for most of the weeks.
2. He spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks.
3. He spent 6 hours in one week.

First, calculate the total hours for the weeks he followed his regular routine:
- There are 8 weeks in total.
- He spent 5 hours for 2 weeks, and 6 hours for 1 week, which accounts for 3 weeks.
- Therefore, the number of weeks he spent 4 hours is \(8 - 3 = 5\) weeks.

Now, calculate the total hours for these 5 weeks:
\[ 5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Next, calculate the total hours for the 2 weeks he spent 5 hours each:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Then, calculate the total hours for the 1 week he spent 6 hours:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, add all these hours together to get the total:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

The total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ 36 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off:
   - Remaining passengers: \( 48 - 8 = 40 \)
3. 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus:
   - Number of people getting on: \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \)
   - New total: \( 40 + 40 = 80 \)
4. On the second stop, 21 passengers get off:
   - Remaining passengers: \( 80 - 21 = 59 \)
5. 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus:
   - Number of people getting on: \( \frac{21}{3} = 7 \)
   - New total: \( 59 + 7 = 66 \)

The number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.

3. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \).

4. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \).

5. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - The current age difference is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \).

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:

"To find the cost of one monitor, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the cost of the computer: $1,100.
2. Determine the cost of the printer: Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.
3. Calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer: $1,100 (computer) + $700 (printer) = $1,800.
4. Subtract the total cost of the computer and the printer from the total amount spent to find the total cost of the 2 monitors: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.
5. Divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor: $600 / 2 = $300.

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many seashells each girl brought back.

1. First, we know that the boys brought back 60 shells each.
2. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

Let's denote the number of shells each boy brought as \( B \). According to the problem, \( B = 60 \).

The number of shells each girl brought is given by:
\[ G = B + 4B \]
\[ G = 60 + 4 \times 60 \]
\[ G = 60 + 240 \]
\[ G = 300 \]

So, each girl brought back 300 seashells.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books:
\[ 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 31 + 50 = 81 \]
\[ 81 + 45 = 126 \]
\[ 126 + 62 = 188 \]

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we first need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

The number of vlogs made in the first week is 18.
The number of vlogs made in the second week is 21.
The number of vlogs made in the third week is 15.

Adding these together gives:
18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs in a month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

Therefore, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to reach her goal.

"To solve this, first, calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill:

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

So, the total amount including the tip is:

$50 + $10 = $60

Since the check is split evenly, each person pays half of the original bill:

$50 / 2 = $25

However, you are responsible for the entire tip, so you pay:

$25 (your half of the bill) + $10 (the tip) = $35

Therefore, you end up paying $35.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125.

1. **Determine the number of days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.**
   - Therefore, the total savings in the first half of April is \( 15x \).

4. **Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half.**
   - Therefore, the amount saved each day in the second half is \( 2x \).
   - The total savings in the second half of April is \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

5. **Set up the equation for the total savings in April:**
   - Total savings = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half
   - \( 1125 = 15x + 30x \)
   - \( 1125 = 45x \)

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{1125}{45} \)
   - \( x = 25 \)

7. **Determine the amount saved each day in the second half:**
   - Amount saved each day in the second half = \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \)

Therefore, Elvis needs to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April to meet his target."

"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the 100 pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \times 7 = 105 \) minutes.

Next, we need to convert the total reading time into the number of pages:

2. For the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, Sharon received half of $1.00, which is $0.50, for each tooth, so that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, we add all these amounts together:

- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total amount: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00

Therefore, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then apply that percentage to the desired temperature of 520 degrees.

First, let's find the percentage by which the oven is off when set to 450 degrees:

1. The actual temperature when set to 450 degrees is 468 degrees.
2. The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is \( 468 - 450 = 18 \) degrees.
3. The percentage by which the oven is off is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Percentage off} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
   \]

Now, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to if she wants it to reach 520 degrees, given that it is off by 4%.

1. Let \( x \) be the temperature she should set the oven to.
2. The actual temperature will be \( x + 0.04x = 1.04x \).
3. We want the actual temperature to be 520 degrees, so:
   \[
   1.04x = 520
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
   \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

"To find the total number of legs, we need to consider the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply by the number of each type of animal:

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, we calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:

- Dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:

\[20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\]

"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight by 50%, which is calculated as follows:

50% of 8 pounds = 0.50 * 8 = 4 pounds

So, the new weight is:

8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds

However, this weight is too heavy, so he uses a weight that is 2 pounds lighter:

12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds

Therefore, the weight that Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed of the plane is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed of the plane is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same speed. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles.

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ 120 \div 2 = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates each of them can make in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

\[ 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:

\[ 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa to find the total:

\[ 720 + 1080 = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

"To find out how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade, we need to calculate the earnings for each period and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the earnings for the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour for the first four hours are \( 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} = 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- For four hours, the total earnings are \( 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ dollars} \).

Next, we calculate the earnings for the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour for the next two hours are \( 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} = 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- For two hours, the total earnings are \( 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars} \).

Finally, we sum the earnings from both periods:
- Total earnings = \( 30 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 42 \text{ dollars} \).

Thus, Patrick earned a total of \( 42 \) dollars from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one month.
2. Determine the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach their maximum number of rotations.

First, we know that every 2 miles the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = \left(\frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles}}\right) \times 725 \text{ rotations} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations in one year (12 months):
\[ \text{Rotations per year} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations:
\[ \text{Years} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Thus, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To find out how much each pump of shampoo costs, we first need to determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from the bottle if she uses 1 pump per wash. Since the bottle gives 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash, we can calculate the total number of washes with 1 pump per wash as follows:

120 washes * 2 pumps/wash = 240 pumps

Now, we know the bottle costs $24.00 and provides 240 pumps. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the number of pumps:

$24.00 / 240 pumps = $0.10 per pump

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents:

$0.10 * 100 cents/dollar = 10 cents

Therefore, each pump costs 10 cents.

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is:
\[ 25 + 35 = 60 \]

Next, we apply the 30% discount to the total cost. A 30% discount means Joe pays 70% of the total cost. So, we calculate 70% of $60:
\[ 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After spending $42, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the amounts of meat eaten by each player who ordered meat.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, this is 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these amounts together:
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"To find out how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sales amount.
2. Determine the cost the company paid to acquire the cars.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the acquisition cost from the total sales.
4. Calculate James's commission based on the profit.

Step 1: Total sales amount
James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
Total sales = 10 * $25,000 = $250,000

Step 2: Acquisition cost
The company paid 30% of the car's price to acquire each car.
Acquisition cost per car = 30% of $25,000 = 0.30 * $25,000 = $7,500
Total acquisition cost for 10 cars = 10 * $7,500 = $75,000

Step 3: Profit
Profit = Total sales - Total acquisition cost
Profit = $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

Step 4: James's commission
James's commission is 10% of the profit.
James's commission = 10% of $175,000 = 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500

Therefore, James made $17,500.

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between them. 

1. First, find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. This is the difference in their speeds:
   \[
   \text{Relative speed} = 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph}
   \]

2. Next, use the relative speed to find the time it takes to close the 75-mile gap:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. First, determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish:
   \[
   \text{Darren's fish} = \text{Naomi's fish} - 6 = 17 - 6 = 11
   \]

2. Next, determine how many fish Tommy caught. Since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren:
   \[
   \text{Tommy's fish} = \text{Darren's fish} + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14
   \]

So, Tommy caught 14 fish.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if he misses some classes. 

1. The total cost for the classes is $60.
2. The total number of classes is 10.
3. The cost per class if he attends all 10 classes is \( \frac{60}{10} = 6 \) dollars per class.

If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class then becomes \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the maximum number of classes \( x \) he can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10.

Set up the inequality:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in a week.

First, we know that Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of customers Jewel processes in a week is:
\[ 50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ customers/week} \]

Next, we know that Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel. Therefore, Julie processes:
\[ 2 \times 50 \text{ customers/day} = 100 \text{ customers/day} \]

Similarly, the total number of customers Julie processes in a week is:
\[ 100 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 700 \text{ customers/week} \]

To find the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel, we add their individual weekly totals:
\[ 350 \text{ customers/week} + 700 \text{ customers/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week} \]

Thus, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[ 1050 \]

"To calculate the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel expenses.

1. Initial cost of the plane: $150,000
2. Monthly hanger rental: $5,000
3. Monthly fuel expenses: $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Next, we calculate the total monthly maintenance cost:
- Monthly maintenance cost = Monthly hanger rental + Monthly fuel expenses
- Monthly maintenance cost = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000

Now, we calculate the total maintenance cost for the year:
- Annual maintenance cost = Monthly maintenance cost * 12
- Annual maintenance cost = $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost to get the total cost for the first year:
- Total cost for the first year = Initial cost of the plane + Annual maintenance cost
- Total cost for the first year = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2 legs)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]

   - Kassidy's amount: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\) dollars.

2. **Determine Rayna's amount:**
   - Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy.
   - Rayna's amount: \(90 + 60 = 150\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money:**
   - Total amount: \(120 + 90 + 150 = 360\) dollars.

4. **Determine the amount each person would have if they share equally:**
   - Number of people: 3.
   - Amount per person: \(\frac{360}{3} = 120\) dollars.

Thus, each person would have 120 dollars if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Days Recorded**: 30 days.
2. **Good Days**: 12 days.
3. **Bad Days**: 8 days.
4. **Neutral Days**: The rest of the days, which is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

Next, we need to consider the distribution of these days over the past 30 days:
- **First 8 days**: All good.
- **Next 8 days**: All bad.
- **Next 8 days**: All neutral.
- **Remaining 6 days**: These are the last 6 days of the 30 days.

Now, we need to account for the next three days:
- The next three days are good, neutral, and good.

So, the last 6 days of the 30 days are:
- Good, Neutral, Good, (and the remaining 3 days are neutral).

Let's count the good days in the last 6 days:
- Good, Neutral, Good, Neutral, Neutral, Neutral.

This means there are 2 good days in the last 6 days.

Now, let's add the good days from the first 8 days and the last 6 days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days.
- Last 6 days: 2 good days.

Total good days in the 30 days:
- \(8 + 2 = 10\) good days.

However, we know from the problem statement that there were 12 good days in total. This means the remaining good days are:
- \(12 - 10 = 2\) good days.

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:

"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \). According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:

\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find \( S \), we first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches.
2. Determine the total growth needed to reach 600 inches.
3. Calculate the number of days required for the bamboo to grow the necessary amount.

First, convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches:
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- Current height = 20 feet = 20 * 12 = 240 inches

Next, determine the total growth needed to reach 600 inches:
- Desired height = 600 inches
- Current height = 240 inches
- Growth needed = 600 - 240 = 360 inches

Now, calculate the number of days required for the bamboo to grow 360 inches:
- Growth rate = 30 inches per day
- Number of days = 360 / 30 = 12 days

Therefore, the bamboo will reach 600 inches in 12 days.

"James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs. There are 8 more dogs, so he needs to buy 8 toys to have enough for all 12 dogs. After buying the toys, he finds that there are now twice as many dogs as when he left, meaning there are now 24 dogs. He then needs to buy 12 more toys to have enough for all 24 dogs. When he comes back, 3 dogs are gone, so he now only needs toys for 21 dogs. Since he already has 12 toys, he needs to buy 9 more toys to have enough for 21 dogs.

Total toys needed: 4 (initial) + 8 (first purchase) + 12 (second purchase) + 9 (final purchase) - 3 (dogs gone) = 30

\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Frances then invests 2/3 of the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480 \]

Finally, we calculate Skyler's investment, which is the rest of the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Skyler's investment} = 720 - 480 = 240 \]

"To determine by how much the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we first need to calculate the total weight of the group.

1. Jack and 8 other adults make a total of 9 people.
2. The average weight of an adult is 80 kg.
3. The total weight of the 9 people is \( 9 \times 80 \) kg.

Let's calculate the total weight:
\[ 9 \times 80 = 720 \text{ kg} \]

Next, we compare this total weight to the maximum load the elevator can support, which is 700 kg.

The amount by which they exceed the maximum load is:
\[ 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg} \]

So, the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

"Let's start by defining the number of cookies each person has in terms of the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has. Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

1. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster:
   \[
   M = C + 12
   \]

2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max:
   \[
   K = M - 5
   \]
   Given that Katarina has 68 cookies:
   \[
   68 = M - 5
   \]
   Solving for \( M \):
   \[
   M = 68 + 5 = 73
   \]

3. Now, we know Max has 73 cookies. Using the equation for Max's cookies in terms of the Cookie Monster's cookies:
   \[
   73 = C + 12
   \]
   Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = 73 - 12 = 61
   \]

4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max:
   \[
   S = M + 23
   \]
   Substituting \( M = 73 \):
   \[
   S = 73 + 23 = 96
   \]

Now, we have the number of cookies each person has:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

To find the total number of cookies, we sum these amounts:
\[
68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( L \).

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the new length after the extension is:
\[ L + 0.5L = 1.5L \]

She then adds 20cm of lace trim to the bottom, making the final length:
\[ 1.5L + 20 \]

We know the final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Chris to mow half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode, and then sum these times.

1. **Time to mow the entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes

2. **Time to mow the entire lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:**
   - 40 minutes

3. **Time to mow half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:**
   - Since it takes 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn, it will take half of that time to mow half of the lawn.
   - \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes

4. **Time to mow half of the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:**
   - Since it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn, it will take half of that time to mow half of the lawn.
   - \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes

5. **Total time to mow the lawn:**

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet: \( T = R + 7 \).
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44: \( 2T + 3R = 44 \).

First, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"First, let's determine the cost of the candies. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so the total cost for the lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the cost of the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over ten years.

First, let's determine how many coins Neil saves each month. Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which means:

\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \right) \]

Calculate the additional amount Neil saves:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

So, Neil saves:

\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins saved by each person over ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years:

\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:

\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Finally, we add the total savings of Rong and Neil to find the combined total:

\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

So, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:

"First, let's determine the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, let's denote the total bill as \( T \). The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill:
\[ \text{Heartworm check} = 0.60T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60T \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:

"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as an apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Cost of apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Cost of oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the fruits:

"To find the total number of squares on Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to determine the number of each color of square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares.

"To determine the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we need to calculate the number of dumplings eaten by both the males and the females.

First, we know that each female ate 3 dumplings. There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Next, we know that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Since each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]
There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

To find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we add the number of dumplings eaten by the males and the females:
\[ 18 + 32 = 50 \]

"To find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to determine the speed of the turtle. 

Given that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and the cat runs at 15 feet/second, we can calculate the turtle's speed as follows:

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{\text{Cat's speed}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Turtle's speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy with $6.00, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, calculate how many scoops Erin can buy without the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

However, with the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. So, for every 3 scoops, she only pays for 2.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops she can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{6.00}{(1.50 \times 2)} = \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Each set gives her 3 scoops, so:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops per set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

"To determine how much James saved by picking blueberries compared to buying them at the store, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries.
2. Calculate the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store.
3. Subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying to find the savings.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries.**

- Fixed cost to go picking: $20
- Cost per pound of blueberries picked: $1.5
- Pounds of blueberries picked: 30

Total cost of picking = Fixed cost + (Cost per pound * Pounds picked)
Total cost of picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
Total cost of picking = $20 + $45
Total cost of picking = $65

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store.**

- Cost per pound of blueberries at the store: $2.5
- Pounds of blueberries: 30

Total cost of buying = Cost per pound * Pounds
Total cost of buying = $2.5 * 30
Total cost of buying = $75

**Step 3: Calculate the savings.**

"First, let's determine Dora's father's age. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

\[ \text{Dora's father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we need to find Dora's mother's age. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can calculate her mother's age as:

\[ \text{Dora's mother's age} = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their ages together:

\[ \text{Total combined age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

"To find out how many votes candidate C received, we first need to determine the number of votes each candidate received.

1. Calculate the number of votes candidate A received:
   - Candidate A got 20% of the votes.
   - 20% of 100 votes = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes.

2. Calculate the number of votes candidate B received:
   - Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A.
   - 50% more than 20 votes = 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes.
   - Therefore, candidate B received 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

3. Calculate the number of votes candidate C received:
   - The total number of votes is 100.
   - Votes for candidate A and B together = 20 + 30 = 50 votes.
   - Therefore, votes for candidate C = 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

Thus, candidate C received 50 votes.

"First, let's determine how many small stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons. She starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them:

\[ 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \text{ small stickers} \]

Each small sticker is worth one small button, so she gets 27 small buttons from this trade.

Next, let's determine how many large stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons. She starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them:

\[ 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \text{ large stickers} \]

Each large sticker is worth one large button, so she gets 20 large buttons from this trade.

Now, let's determine how many large stickers she has left after trading 50% of them:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ large stickers} \]

She trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons. Each large sticker is worth three small buttons:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ small buttons} \]

Now, let's sum up all the buttons Lorraine has by the end. She has 27 small buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading the remaining large stickers:

\[ 27 \text{ small buttons} + 60 \text{ small buttons} = 87 \text{ small buttons} \]
\[ 20 \text{ large buttons} \]

Since each large button is worth three small buttons, we can convert the large buttons to small buttons to find the total number of buttons:

\[ 20 \text{ large buttons} \times 3 = 60 \text{ small buttons} \]

Adding the small buttons together:

\[ 87 \text{ small buttons} + 60 \text{ small buttons} = 147 \text{ small buttons} \]

Thus, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is:

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

"To find out how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of rides on the usual days and the number of rides on the special days.

1. **Usual Days:**
   - They ride their bikes 3 times a day.
   - This happens for 5 days.
   - Total rides on usual days = 3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides.

2. **Special Days:**
   - On these days, they ride twice the number of times they do on usual days.
   - Twice the usual number of rides (3 times) is 2 * 3 = 6 rides/day.
   - This happens for 2 days.
   - Total rides on special days = 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides.

3. **Total Rides in a Week:**
   - Total rides = rides on usual days + rides on special days
   - Total rides = 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides.

Therefore, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is 27.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, Bob had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.
2. He bought 17 more fish from the pet store, which included both orange and white fish.
3. After adding these 17 fish to his pond, he found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of white fish Bob bought.
- \( y \) as the number of orange fish Bob bought.

From the problem, we know:
- \( x + y = 17 \) (total number of fish bought)
- After adding the new fish, the total number of white fish is \( 4 + x \).
- After adding the new fish, the total number of orange fish is \( 3 + y \).

According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
\[ 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

First, simplify the equation:
\[ 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \]
\[ 3 + y = 8 + 2x \]
\[ y = 8 + 2x - 3 \]
\[ y = 5 + 2x \]

Next, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation:
\[ x + (5 + 2x) = 17 \]
\[ x + 5 + 2x = 17 \]
\[ 3x + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3x = 12 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) (correct).
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- Check the condition: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \) (correct).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy drives in a week.
2. Determine the total amount of gas used in a week.
3. Calculate the total cost of the gas used in a week.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance driven in a week.**

Andy drives to work and back home each day, so the round trip distance is:
\[ 5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles/day} \]

Since he drives from Monday to Friday, the total distance for the week is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of gas used in a week.**

Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon. Therefore, the total amount of gas used in a week is:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the gas used in a week.**

The price of gas is $3 per gallon, so the total cost for the gas used in a week is:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons/week} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of employees after three months and then determine the total salary cost for all employees over that period.

1. **Initial number of employees**: 200
2. **Number of new employees hired each month**: 20
3. **Number of months**: 3

First, calculate the total number of new employees hired over three months:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

Next, calculate the total number of employees after three months:

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made with the total number of glass chips.
3. Use the height of the mosaic to find the length.

First, calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has:
\[ 2 \text{ bags} \times 72 \text{ chips per bag} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made with 144 chips:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips per square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we can find the length by dividing the total area by the height:

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week. Since he charges $0.25 per branch and made $105 in total, we can calculate the total number of branches by dividing the total earnings by the cost per branch:

Total branches climbed = Total earnings / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420 branches

Now, to find the average number of branches climbed per day, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week:

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days in a week
Average branches per day = 420 branches / 7 days
Average branches per day = 60 branches

2. Subtract the petals of the flowers that were dropped.
3. Sum the remaining petals.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower:**

- For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
  \[
  3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals}
  \]

- For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money spent by Jack and his three friends over the 4 hours they played.

First, let's determine how long each person can play with one quarter:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
- Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, which is \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes per quarter.
- One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

Next, we need to find out how many quarters each person uses in 4 hours (240 minutes):
- Jack: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \)
- Two friends (10 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters each} \)
- One friend (30 minutes per quarter): \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \)

Now, we calculate the total number of quarters used by all four friends:
- Jack: 12 quarters
- Two friends: \(24 \text{ quarters each} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters}\)
- One friend: 8 quarters

Total quarters used: \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters}\)

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money spent is:
\[ 68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money used is:

"Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as \( z \) ounces. Since Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so the amount of salt is \( 2z \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( 2z \) ounces.

The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2 \times 2z = 4z \) ounces.

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil is \( 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) ounces.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:

"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance he covers in each part of his journey and then sum these distances.

1. First, we calculate the distance Mason travels in the first 4 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. Next, we calculate the distance Mason travels in the next 6 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. Finally, we sum the distances from both parts of the journey to find the total distance:
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Thus, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the kangaroos and then use that information to find out how long it will take the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the distance across the highway be \( D \) miles.
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( S \) miles per hour.
   - Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance \( D \), the total distance traveled by the 3 kangaroos is \( 3 \times S \times 18 \) miles.
   - However, since they are traveling the same distance \( D \) together, we can say:
     \[
     3 \times S \times 18 = D
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     54S = D
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

   \]
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory. Therefore, Jada made:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ dishes}
   \]

Now, we sum the number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora:
\[
20 + 40 + 80 = 140
\]

Thus, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is:
\[
140

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after all contributions and then subtract the cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in reduces the price by $200, so the new cost is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her part-time job earnings, and the money from her mom:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"First, we calculate the total number of slices from the large apples:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

Next, we calculate the total number of slices from the small apples:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Now, we add the slices from both large and small apples to find the total number of slices:
15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract this from the total number of slices:
30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is:

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 6 \text{ mm}
   \]

Now, we sum the remaining lengths:
\[
2 \text{ mm} + 8 \text{ mm} + 6 \text{ mm} = 16 \text{ mm}

"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first determine the number of each type of car and then use the total number of cars to find the number of yellow cars.

1. **Red Cars**: The rink has 12 red cars.
2. **Green Cars**: The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars.
   \[
   \text{Number of green cars} = 12 - 2 = 10
   \]
3. **Blue Cars**: The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30
   \]
4. **Total Cars**: The rink has 75 cars in total.

Now, we can calculate the number of yellow cars by subtracting the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[
\text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - (\text{Number of red cars} + \text{Number of green cars} + \text{Number of blue cars})
\]
\[
\text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - (12 + 10 + 30)
\]
\[
\text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - 52
\]
\[
\text{Number of yellow cars} = 23

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \), the number of books that Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books that Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (the total number of books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now we have:
\[ S = F + 13 \]
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we first need to determine how many glasses each of the boys sold. Since Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold a total of 32 glasses and Julie sold 14 glasses, we can calculate the total number of glasses sold by the boys as follows:

Total glasses sold by the boys = Total glasses sold - Glasses sold by Julie
Total glasses sold by the boys = 32 - 14
Total glasses sold by the boys = 18

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the total number of glasses sold by the boys by 2:

Glasses sold by each boy = Total glasses sold by the boys / 2
Glasses sold by each boy = 18 / 2
Glasses sold by each boy = 9

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses sold by Micah from the number of glasses sold by Julie:

"To solve the problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can set up the following equation to find her current age:

\[ \text{Current age} + 10 = 18 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Current age} = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be three times her current age. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Simplify the right side:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Kelly has in her cart:

1. The total cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10, so each pack of bacon costs:
   \[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack} \]

2. Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so:
   \[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet of chicken} \]
   Since she has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

3. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and she has 3 packs, so:
   \[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

4. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so:
   \[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack of apples} \]
   Since she has 7 packs of apples, the total cost for apples is:
   \[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[ 10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly’s budget is $65, so the amount of money she has left is:

"To find the speed at which a whirligig spins, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of a thingamabob.
2. Use the speed of a thingamabob to find the speed of a whirligig.

First, we know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can find the speed of a thingamabob by dividing the speed of a whatchamacallit by 11:

\[ \text{Speed of a thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, we can find the speed of a whirligig by multiplying the speed of a thingamabob by 5:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns and then subtract that from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

1. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed each lawn:**
   - Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

2. **Calculate the total number of times Tasha mowed lawns:**
   - Total times mowing lawns = \( J + 3J + 5J = 9J \).

3. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.
   - Since \( J \) is the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, and she was paid $6 for all her work, we can assume \( J = 1 \) (since the problem doesn't specify the rate per lawn, we assume the total payment is for all the work done).

"First, we need to determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. Since Martha ended up with 7 notebooks after buying 5 more, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Original number of notebooks Martha had} + 5 = 7 \]

Solving for the original number of notebooks:

\[ \text{Original number of notebooks Martha had} = 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. Therefore, Joseph had:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bowls of soup Calvin has and how many bowls will be used for dinner, and then how many will be left for the children's lunch.

1. The pot contains enough soup to fill:
   - 4 adult bowls
   - 8 child bowls

2. Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will each have one adult bowl. This means:
   - 2 adult bowls will be used for dinner.

3. Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, 2 adult bowls are equivalent to:
   - 2 adult bowls * 2 child bowls/adult bowl = 4 child bowls

4. Calvin and his wife will use 4 child bowls worth of soup for dinner.

5. The pot originally has 8 child bowls of soup. After dinner, the remaining soup is:
   - 8 child bowls - 4 child bowls = 4 child bowls

6. Calvin has two children, and each child will have one bowl at a meal. Therefore, the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup is:
   - 4 child bowls / 2 children = 2 times

Each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times.

"To determine the total amount of material Jo needs, we first calculate the material required for the small and large masks separately.

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Adding the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

"To find out how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they both received the same amount of allowance.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons. 
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they each received the same amount, we divide the total cost by 2:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.**

Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops:
\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.**

Each lollipop was sold for $0.8:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.**

Each lollipop was bought for $0.5:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the profit.**

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{bus}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

The distance traveled by the car is calculated as:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{car}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

The difference in distance traveled between the bus and the car is:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of toys Sophie already had and then subtract this total from the new total number of toys.

The number of building blocks is 31.
The number of stuffed animals is 8.
The number of stacking rings is 9.

First, we add these numbers together:
31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Sophie's total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls is 62.

Now, we subtract the total number of toys she had before from the new total:
62 - 48 = 14

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated by the 10 people. Each person donates 5 boxes, so:
\[ 10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we add the 10 boxes of stuff they already have:
\[ 50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all 60 boxes, given that each table can hold 2 boxes:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

They already own 15 tables, so the number of new tables needed is:
\[ 30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ tables} \]

"To find the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney, we first need to calculate the total distance each of them spits their seeds.

1. **Zoey's total distance:**
   - Zoey has 40 seeds.
   - She spits each seed 10 feet.
   - Total distance for Zoey = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

2. **Sydney's total distance:**
   - Sydney has 35 seeds.
   - She spits each seed 12 feet.
   - Total distance for Sydney = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

3. **Combined total distance:**
   - Combined total distance = Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance
   - Combined total distance = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.

4. **Average total distance:**
   - To find the average, we divide the combined total distance by the number of participants (2).

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we first calculate the amount of hay required for the goats and the sheep separately.

1. **Calculate the hay needed for the goats:**
   - Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = \( 5 \text{ pounds/goat} \times 15 \text{ goats} = 75 \text{ pounds} \).

2. **Calculate the hay needed for the sheep:**
   - Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = \( 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \).
   - Each sheep needs \( 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \).
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = \( 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} \times 12 \text{ sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Calculate the total hay needed:**
   - Total hay = Hay for goats + Hay for sheep

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time James spends swimming the initial distance:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 12 \) miles / \( 2 \) miles per hour = 6 hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   - Rest time = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \) hours = 3 hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**

"To find the total commission Cayley earns, we need to calculate the commission from each type of newspaper and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times:
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- The commission per copy of the New York Times is \( 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \) dollars.
- Cayley sells 6 copies of the New York Times, so the total commission from the New York Times is \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is \( 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \) dollars.
- Cayley sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal, so the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is \( 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \) dollars.

Finally, we sum the commissions from both newspapers:

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

   - Third day: 8 holes, but 2 holes were filled in, so the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

   Total holes by the end of the third day:
   \[
   10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \text{ holes}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:**
   - According to the problem, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes dug on the first day.
   - Number of holes dug on the first day: 10
   - Therefore, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day:**
   - Total holes by the end of the fourth day: 40
   - Total holes by the end of the third day: 29
   - Holes dug on the fourth day:
   \[
   40 - 29 = 11 \text{ holes}
   \]

Thus, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
\[
\boxed{11}

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Together they have caught 339 Pokemon:
   \[
   A + S + X = 339
   \]
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   X = S + 5
   \]
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught:
   \[
   S = 4A - 13
   \]

We can substitute \( X \) and \( S \) in the first equation using the second and third equations.

First, substitute \( X = S + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 2S + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
A + 2S = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[
A + 2(4A - 13) = 334
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 8A - 26 = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9A = 360
\]
Divide by 9:
\[
A = 40
\]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the equation \( S = 4A - 13 \):
\[
S = 4(40) - 13
\]
Simplify:
\[
S = 160 - 13
\]
\[
S = 147
\]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

\[
\boxed{147}

"To determine the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction.

1. **First leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ 374 \text{ miles} \]

"To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of brownies Greta had initially.
2. Subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party.

First, let's convert all quantities to individual brownies (1 dozen = 12 brownies):

- Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies: \(1 \times 12 = 12\) brownies.
- She brought home 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office: \(0.5 \times 12 = 6\) brownies.
- Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies to the surprise party: \(4 \times 12 = 48\) brownies.

Now, let's add up all the brownies she had initially:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \]

Next, we need to subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party:
- 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten: \(1.5 \times 12 = 18\) brownies.

So, the number of brownies left over is:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \]

Therefore, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. Subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total soil:

"To determine the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the problem into two parts: peeling and cooking.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To find out how long it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the rate at which she peels them:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Cooking the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To find out how long it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we first determine how many batches of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 10 minutes to cook, the total cooking time is:
     \[
     \text{Time to cook 90 shrimp} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to peel and cook 90 shrimp is the sum of the peeling time and the cooking time:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature changes step by step:

1. **Cooling on low for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 3 hours, the temperature drops by \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) degrees.

2. **Cooling on high for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - In 4 hours, the temperature drops by \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) degrees.

3. **Warming up for 2 hours with no air conditioner:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the temperature increases by \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) degrees.

Now, we sum up the temperature changes:
- Total cooling: \( 6 + 12 = 18 \) degrees.
- Total warming: \( 4 \) degrees.

The net temperature change is:
- \( 18 - 4 = 14 \) degrees.

Thus, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final answer is:

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to consider each type of check and the frequency at which he writes them:

1. **Electric bill checks**: 1 check per month
   - 1 check/month × 12 months/year = 12 checks/year

2. **Gas bill checks**: 1 check per month
   - 1 check/month × 12 months/year = 12 checks/year

3. **Church checks**: 2 checks per month
   - 2 checks/month × 12 months/year = 24 checks/year

4. **Pest and lawn service checks**: 1 check per quarter
   - 1 check/quarter × 4 quarters/year = 4 checks/year

Now, we sum up all the checks:
- Electric bill checks: 12 checks/year
- Gas bill checks: 12 checks/year
- Church checks: 24 checks/year
- Pest and lawn service checks: 4 checks/year

Total checks per year:
12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52

"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \).

The first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France and the number of flights to Germany are each \( \frac{1}{8}F \) (since \( \frac{1}{4}F \) is split equally between the two destinations).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes is:
\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France:
\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8}F = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11 \]

Thus, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

"To find the combined length of time the three wolves' howls, we first need to determine the duration of each wolf's howl.

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - Combined howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the combined howl duration to minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we start by using the information given:

1. The total age of the children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: \( A = 3 \)
- Alessandro: \( L = 4 \)
- Helene: \( H \)
- Wilfred: \( W \)

The total age of the children is:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we use the information that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total amount Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund, which is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Next, we add the $200 from his friend to the total amount collected, which is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates, so the lawyer's contribution is 3 * $2200 = $6600.

"First, we need to calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests to the wedding reception. Since there were 100 guests and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

The bride decided to give 1/2 of these cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, the number of people in the church can be calculated by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total watermelon is divided into slices for 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices in terms of \( x \) is:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

The total watermelon is therefore \( 8x \).

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( x \) be the number of chocolate bars in one box.

Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combine the terms on the left side:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the following:

1. The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
2. The cost per student per session is $1.50.
3. The studio has 10 students.
4. The studio is rented 3 days a week.
5. We assume a month has 4 weeks.

First, calculate the total cost per session:
- Cost to rent the studio per session: $25
- Cost per student per session: $1.50 * 10 students = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40

Next, calculate the total cost per week:
- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- Total cost per week: $40 * 3 = $120

Then, calculate the total cost per month:
- There are 4 weeks in a month.
- Total cost per month: $120 * 4 = $480

Since the question asks for the expected earnings, and the costs are the expenses, the expected earnings would be the negative of the total cost (assuming no revenue is generated from the students).

However, if the question is asking for the total expenses, the answer is:

"To find the total number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of female porcupines.
2. Calculate the number of babies born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of babies born in a year.
4. Add the total number of babies born in a year to the initial population.

**Step 1: Determine the number of female porcupines.**

The total population of porcupines is 50. The number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population:
\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of babies born each month.**

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is:
\[
\text{Babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of babies born in a year.**

There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of babies born in a year is:
\[
\text{Babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

**Step 4: Add the total number of babies born in a year to the initial population.**

The initial population is 50. Adding the total number of babies born in a year gives:
\[
\text{Total population after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

Thus, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year is:
\[
\boxed{1490}

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.**

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost.**

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining to find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park.

1. **Determine the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Determine the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge remaining is 34.8%.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   \[
   y \times 0.59049 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589

"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Janet needs for the down payment.
2. Determine Janet's total earnings per hour.
3. Calculate Janet's total earnings per week.
4. Determine how many weeks it will take for Janet to save the down payment.

**Step 1: Calculate the down payment amount.**
The car costs $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of this amount for the down payment.
\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \]

**Step 2: Determine Janet's total earnings per hour.**
Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips.
\[ \text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = 25 \]

**Step 3: Calculate Janet's total earnings per week.**
Janet works 40 hours a week.
\[ \text{Total earnings per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \]

**Step 4: Determine how many weeks it will take to save the down payment.**
\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Down payment}}{\text{Total earnings per week}} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50 each = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50 each = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00 each = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75 each = $3.75

Now, let's add up these costs to find the total amount spent so far:

Total spent = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount is:

$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:

$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future value (the price after three years),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

Plugging in the values:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]

First, calculate \( 1 + 0.05 \):

\[ 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 \]

Next, raise 1.05 to the power of 3:

\[ 1.05^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be:

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine the rate at which he reads and then use that rate to calculate the time spent reading 18 pages.

First, we know that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. Therefore, his reading rate is:
\[ \text{Reading rate} = \frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 0.3 \text{ pages per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We can use the reading rate to calculate this:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{0.3 \text{ pages per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:**
   - Total number of questions = 60
   - Percentage of easy questions = 40%
   - Number of easy questions = 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24

   The remaining questions are divided equally between average and difficult questions:
   - Number of average questions = (60 - 24) / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18
   - Number of difficult questions = (60 - 24) / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18

2. **Calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Aries gets 75% of the easy questions correct:
     - Number of easy questions correct = 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18

   - Aries gets half of the average questions correct:
     - Number of average questions correct = 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9

   - Aries gets half of the difficult questions correct:
     - Number of difficult questions correct = 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9

3. **Sum the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Total correct questions = Number of easy questions correct + Number of average questions correct + Number of difficult questions correct
   - Total correct questions = 18 + 9 + 9 = 36

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 36 points.

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not have to turn it in and then subtract this from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability: 50%

2. **Normal Teacher (50% chance):**
   - If the normal teacher comes in, there is a 40% chance she will give everyone an extension.
     - Probability: 50% * 40% = 20%
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension (60% chance), there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his assignment.
     - Probability: 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%

Now, we add up the probabilities of all the scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:

- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the 3 years from 2007 to 2010.

The formula for depreciation is:
\[ P = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the final price of the car.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price of the car.
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate.
- \( t \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 20000 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.21 \) (21%)
- \( t = 3 \) years

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ P = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]

"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Weekly Laundry Calculation:**
   - Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week.
   - The laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time.

2. **Twin Sheets:**
   - Greg needs to wash 4 twin sets of sheets each week.
   - Since the machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, he will need to do:
     \[
     \frac{4 \text{ twin sets}}{2 \text{ twin sets per load}} = 2 \text{ loads for twin sheets}
     \]

3. **King Sheets:**
   - Greg needs to wash 1 king set of sheets each week.
   - Since the machine can wash 1 king set at a time, he will need to do:
     \[
     \frac{1 \text{ king set}}{1 \text{ king set per load}} = 1 \text{ load for king sheets}
     \]

4. **Total Weekly Loads:**

"To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to calculate the total amount of food the cats consume per day and then divide the total amount of food by this daily consumption.

1. First, calculate the total amount of food consumed per feeding:
   - Each cat eats 60 grams per feeding.
   - There are 3 cats.
   - Total food per feeding = 60 grams/cat * 3 cats = 180 grams.

2. Next, calculate the total amount of food consumed per day:
   - The cats are fed twice a day.
   - Total food per day = 180 grams/feeding * 2 feedings/day = 360 grams/day.

3. Finally, determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:
   - Total food available = 720 grams.
   - Total food consumed per day = 360 grams/day.
   - Number of days the food will last = 720 grams / 360 grams/day = 2 days.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of slices each person ate:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.

2. **Calculate the total number of slices eaten:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Jake ate 7 slices.
   - Silvia ate 14 slices.
   - Total slices eaten = \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\).

3. **Verify the total number of slices available:**
   - Each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas, so the total number of slices is \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

Since the total number of slices eaten (31) is less than the total number of slices available (32), the solution is consistent.

The total number of slices they ate is:
31"
"Let's denote the time Donovan took to make his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's time can be represented as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the times taken by Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, is:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

2. **Cost of the visit**: The visit lasts 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The doctor charges $300 per hour.
   \[
   \text{Cost of the visit} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \times 300 \text{ dollars/hour} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the painkillers**: Hannah gets 30 painkillers, and each pill costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Cost of the painkillers} = 30 \text{ pills} \times 4 \text{ dollars/pill} = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Cost of parking**: The mandatory minimum parking time is 2 hours, and the cost is $6 per hour.

2. Calculate the total cost of mailing the small coupons.
3. Calculate the total cost of mailing the big coupons.
4. Add the costs from steps 2 and 3 to get the total cost.

Step 1: Calculate the number of big coupons.
Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he is sending out 700 small coupons:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \text{ big coupons} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of mailing the small coupons.
Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the small coupons is:

2. Calculate the number of trucks that had mechanical failures.
3. Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser.
4. Determine the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the trucks that did not have mechanical failures.

Step 1: Total number of trucks dispatched
- Mr Hezekiah dispatched 20 trucks.

Step 2: Number of trucks with mechanical failures
- A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures.
- Number of trucks with mechanical failures = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \) trucks.

Step 3: Number of trucks that successfully delivered
- Number of trucks that successfully delivered = Total trucks - Trucks with mechanical failures
- Number of trucks that successfully delivered = 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Step 4: Total amount of fertiliser delivered
- Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser.
- Total amount of fertiliser delivered = Number of trucks that successfully delivered \(\times\) Tons of fertiliser per truck
- Total amount of fertiliser delivered = 15 \(\times\) 20 = 300 tons.

"To find out how many jellyfish 5 springs would create in 4 hours, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of seconds in 4 hours.
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - Therefore, 4 hours = 4 * 60 * 60 = 14400 seconds

2. Calculate the number of jellyfish one spring creates in 4 hours.
   - Since one spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, in 14400 seconds, it would create 14400 jellyfish.

3. Calculate the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs.
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish, then 5 springs would create 5 * 14400 = 72000 jellyfish.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is 72000.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance James walked and then determine the time it took based on his walking speed.

1. **Distance to the store**: 4 miles.
2. **Halfway to the store**: 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.
3. **Distance walked to the halfway point and back home**: 2 miles (to the halfway point) + 2 miles (back home) = 4 miles.
4. **Distance from home to the store after returning home**: 4 miles.

So, the total distance James walked is:
4 miles (to the halfway point and back home) + 4 miles (from home to the store) = 8 miles.

5. **Walking speed**: 4 miles per hour.

To find the total time taken, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time it took James to reach the store is 2 hours.

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost of the bananas both ways and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Each bunch averages 4 bananas.
- Total number of bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Cost per banana = $0.80.
- Total cost for 40 bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Cost per bunch = $3.00.
- Total cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

Finally, let's find the amount of money Jenny saved:
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Thus, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."

"First, let's calculate the total number of periods John has in a week. Since he has 6 periods a day and 2 extra classes, he has a total of 8 periods a day. He goes to class for 5 days a week, so:

\[ 8 \text{ periods/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ periods/week} \]

Each class is 40 minutes long, so the total minutes spent in class each week is:

\[ 40 \text{ periods/week} \times 40 \text{ minutes/period} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

John spends an additional 1/16 of his weekly class time on Saturday and Sunday. The extra learning time for each day is:

\[ \frac{1600 \text{ minutes/week}}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he spends this extra time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:

\[ 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the extra learning time to the regular class time gives the total weekly learning time:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, the total number of hours John spends learning each week is:

"Let's denote the total weight of the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the remaining meat is:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2}
   \]

2. The pack of velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so the remaining meat after the velociraptors is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4}
   \]

3. The group of Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, so:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270

"To determine the cost to paint the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

1. Calculate the area of the north and south walls:
   - Each wall is 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.
   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls = 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet.

2. Calculate the area of the east and west walls:
   - Each wall is 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.
   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls = 2 * 40 square feet = 80 square feet.

3. Calculate the total area of all four walls:
   - Total area = 160 square feet (north and south) + 80 square feet (east and west) = 240 square feet.

4. Determine the number of gallons of paint needed:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy takes off.
3. Calculate the number of days Billy works.
4. Calculate the total number of people Billy helps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.

Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

"First, let's determine how many kilograms of apples Pierre and Paul will take:

- Pierre wants a quarter of the 12 kg of apples:
  \[
  \text{Pierre's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg}
  \]

- Paul wants a third of the 12 kg of apples:
  \[
  \text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of apples taken by Pierre and Paul:
\[
\text{Total taken by Pierre and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg}
\]

Finally, we find out how many kilograms of apples Jacques will have left:
\[
\text{Jacques's share} = 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg}
\]

Thus, Jacques will have 5 kg of apples left.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( S \) be the number of stickers Seth had initially.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris. The remaining stickers are \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \).
5. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, the total number of stickers Kris had is \( 9 + 7 = 16 \).
6. Since Kris had \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{S}{4} = 16

"To solve the problem, let's first determine how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12 marbles, 2 dozen equals 24 marbles. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.

Let \( x \) be the number of marbles Bob currently has. According to the problem:
\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, the number of marbles he will have is:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_1 \) as the temperature of the water in the first mug (33 degrees).
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug (unknown).
- \( T_f \) as the final temperature of the mixed water.

Donny pours 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) when mixing two different temperatures of water is given by:
\[ T_f = \frac{(m_1 \cdot T_1) + (m_2 \cdot T_2)}{m_1 + m_2} \]

Where:
- \( m_1 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the first mug (4 ounces).
- \( m_2 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the second mug (1 ounce).

Substituting the known values:
\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T_2)}{4 + 1} \]
\[ T_f = \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

To solve for \( T_2 \), multiply both sides by 5:
\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:
\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"

"First, we calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pack} = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to get the discounted total:
\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of bagels in 4 packs:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we find the cost per bagel by dividing the discounted total by the total number of bagels:

"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the problem, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes} \times 18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops}} \]
\[ x = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ x = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the number of red jellybeans and then subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

1. The number of green jellybeans is given as 17.
2. The number of red jellybeans is twice the number of green jellybeans, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of red jellybeans} = 2 \times 17 = 34
   \]
3. The total number of jellybeans is 60. To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total:
   \[
   \text{Number of blue jellybeans} = 60 - (\text{Number of green jellybeans} + \text{Number of red jellybeans})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of blue jellybeans} = 60 - (17 + 34) = 60 - 51 = 9

"To find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree**: 50 fruits
2. **6-year-old tree**: 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. **7-year-old tree**: 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. **8-year-old tree**: 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree
5. **9-year-old tree**: 0 fruits (no production)
6. **10-year-old tree**: 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, we need to determine the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters. According to the problem, the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now, we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters. The length of the red rope is:

"Let's start by determining how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, we have:

\[ \text{Rissa's money} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

Solving the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left after giving $3 to his little sister. Ronnie originally had $5, so:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many dishwasher pods are in the special size box and then calculate how many cycles can be run for $1.

1. **Calculate the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - A regular box has 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 pods is \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) pods.
   - Therefore, the special size box has \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Determine the cost per pod in the special size box:**
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - The number of pods in the special size box is 120.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Calculate how many pods can be bought for $1:**
   - Since each pod costs $0.10, the number of pods that can be bought for $1 is \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

4. **Determine the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with 10 pods:**
   - Since 1 pod is used per cycle, 10 pods can run 10 cycles.

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1 is:

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $20 bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 of these $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas triples the value of the remaining $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Value of remaining $20 bills} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled value} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to $5 Bills:**
   Thomas converts the $1200 into $5 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $5 bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

Thus, the final number of $5 bills Thomas has is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\)
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\)
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\)

The total number of goals scored in the match is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday and then calculate how many days it will take for the remaining chalk to be less than 2 inches, given that he uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - On Monday, he uses 45% of the chalk.
   - The amount of chalk used on Monday is \( 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \) inches.
   - The remaining chalk after Monday is \( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches.

2. **Determine how much chalk is used each subsequent day:**
   - Each day, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk.
   - The remaining chalk after each day is 80% of the previous day's remaining chalk.

3. **Calculate the remaining chalk for each subsequent day:**
   - Let \( C_n \) be the remaining chalk after \( n \) days.
   - \( C_0 = 2.75 \) inches (remaining after Monday).
   - \( C_1 = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \) inches.
   - \( C_2 = 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \) inches.

4. **Determine the number of days before the chalk is less than 2 inches:**
   - After 1 day, the remaining chalk is 2.20 inches.
   - After 2 days, the remaining chalk is 1.76 inches, which is less than 2 inches.

Therefore, the teacher has to recycle the piece of chalk after 2 more days.

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, expand the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school.

First, we find out how many books Bob can buy with $27000. We know that 100 books cost $500. Therefore, the cost per book is:
\[ \text{Cost per book} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000:
\[ \text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Since Bob is distributing the books equally among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3:
\[ \text{Number of books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books} \]

Thus, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

1. **First Day:**
   - Used: 38 bandages
   - Ordered: 1 bulk pack (50 bandages)
   - Net change: -38 + 50 = +12 bandages

2. **Second Day:**
   - Used: 38 - 10 = 28 bandages
   - Ordered: 0 bulk packs
   - Net change: -28 bandages

3. **Third Day:**
   - Used: 50 / 2 = 25 bandages (half a pack)
   - Ordered: 2 bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages)

"To determine how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had.
2. Subtract the number of colors stolen by her sister.
3. Subtract the number of colors used up from one makeup set.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had.**

- Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each:
  \[
  2 \text{ palettes} \times 4 \text{ colors per palette} = 8 \text{ colors}
  \]

- Amy also had three makeup sets with six colors each:
  \[
  3 \text{ makeup sets} \times 6 \text{ colors per set} = 18 \text{ colors}
  \]

- Therefore, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had is:
  \[
  8 \text{ colors from palettes} + 18 \text{ colors from makeup sets} = 26 \text{ colors}
  \]

**Step 2: Subtract the number of colors stolen by her sister.**

- Her sister steals one of the palettes, which has 4 colors:
  \[
  26 \text{ colors} - 4 \text{ colors} = 22 \text{ colors}
  \]

**Step 3: Subtract the number of colors used up from one makeup set.**

- Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Each makeup set has 6 colors, so half of 6 colors is:
  \[
  \frac{6 \text{ colors}}{2} = 3 \text{ colors}
  \]

- Subtract these 3 colors from the remaining total:
  \[
  22 \text{ colors} - 3 \text{ colors} = 19 \text{ colors}
  \]

Therefore, the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[
19

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total height of the house.
2. Determine the height of the first floor.
3. Subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house to find the height of the second floor.

First, we calculate the total height of the house:
\[ \text{Total height of the house} = 7 \times \text{Mattison's height} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we calculate the height of the first floor:
\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times \text{Mattison's height} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the height of the second floor by subtracting the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:
\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = \text{Total height of the house} - \text{Height of the first floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Thus, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average distance walked by the dogs.

The average distance walked by the 4 dogs is 3 miles per day. This means the total distance walked by all 4 dogs combined is:
\[ 4 \text{ dogs} \times 3 \text{ miles/dog} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

We know the distances walked by the first three dogs:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

Adding these distances together gives:
\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find the distance walked by the last dog, we subtract the total distance walked by the first three dogs from the total distance walked by all four dogs:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

"First, we calculate how many apples Walter ate. He ate 2/5 of the 60 apples:

\[ \text{Apples eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

Next, we find out how many apples are left after he ate 24 of them:

\[ \text{Remaining apples after eating} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Then, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples:

\[ \text{Apples given to sister} = 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \]

Now, we calculate how many apples are left after giving 9 to his sister:

\[ \text{Remaining apples after giving to sister} = 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold these 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each:

\[ \text{Money received} = 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Walter received is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought. 

Rose bought five dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40. 

Total cost = 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Next, let's determine how many eggs Rose has in total. 

Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs

Now, let's calculate how much Rose will earn from selling the eggs. 

She sells the eggs at a rate of $1 for 3 eggs. Therefore, the total number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs is:

60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets

So, the total earnings from selling the eggs will be:

20 sets * $1/set = $20.00

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:

Profit = Total earnings - Total cost = $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00

Therefore, Rose's profit is $8.00.

   - Tim needs 1 cup of lemon juice for 1 gallon of lemonade.
   - He needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade.
   - Therefore, he needs \(4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups of lemon juice}\).
   - Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, he will need \(4 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 24 \text{ lemons}\).

2. **Lemons for Allen's extra gallon:**
   - Allen wants a gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart.
   - This means Allen's gallon will require 2 cups of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, he will need \(2 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 12 \text{ lemons}\).

3. **Total lemons needed:**
   - For the pool party: 24 lemons
   - For Allen's extra gallon: 12 lemons
   - Total: \(24 \text{ lemons} + 12 \text{ lemons} = 36 \text{ lemons}\)

Therefore, Tim will need 36 lemons in total.

   - Value of quarters: \( 32 \times 0.25 = 8 \) dollars

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - Number of dimes: 95
   - Value of dimes: \( 95 \times 0.10 = 9.50 \) dollars

3. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - Number of nickels: 120
   - Value of nickels: \( 120 \times 0.05 = 6 \) dollars

4. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - Number of pennies: 750
   - Value of pennies: \( 750 \times 0.01 = 7.50 \) dollars

Now, we sum the values of all the coins to get the total dollar amount:
\[ 8 + 9.50 + 6 + 7.50 = 31 \]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the jar is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes each night. Therefore, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to determine how many days it will take Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given:
- Norman High School enrolls 4000 students on average.
- Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School.

First, calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School:
\[ \text{Butler High School enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000 \]

Next, find the difference in enrollment between the two schools:
\[ \text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made: 7995
Number of rainbow cookies: 2595
Number of oatmeal cookies: 3075

Number of chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - Rainbow cookies - Oatmeal cookies
Number of chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 2595 - 3075

Now, let's do the math:

7995 - 2595 = 5400
5400 - 3075 = 2325

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies is 2325.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many beakers Igor lost. Let's break down the information given:

1. Dr. Grumpus requested:
   - 16 test tubes
   - 7 beakers
   - 14 Petri dishes

2. Igor gathered:
   - Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
   - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
   - The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers

3. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as \( x \). Therefore, the number of beakers Igor actually placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

Now, we can set up the equation for the total number of items on the lab bench:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \]
\[ 31 - x = 29 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 31 - 29 = x \]
\[ x = 2 \]

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers.

"To determine how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables and then subtract this from the number of screws he has.

1. Each table has 4 legs.
2. Each leg needs 2 screws.
3. Therefore, each table requires \(4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws}\).
4. James is putting together 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed is \(4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws}\).
5. James has 40 screws in total.

Now, we subtract the number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

So, the number of screws James will have left over is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race. Let's break down the information given:

1. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
2. Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran 2 miles.
3. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.
4. Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.

First, we calculate Aaron's speed:
- Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes.
- Therefore, Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

Next, we determine Vanessa's speed:
- Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's speed.
- Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{16 \text{ minutes}} \).

Now, we calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:
- Time = Distance / Speed
- Time = \( 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, so:

\[ 3 \text{ feet of line} \times 200 \text{ feet of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. Therefore, the additional amount of line he needs to buy is:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate the total revenue from reservations and then multiply it by the number of days the restaurant is open each week.

First, let's calculate the revenue from one reservation:
- Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each, so the cost for meals is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
- Each reservation also orders a $5 bottle of wine.

So, the total revenue from one reservation is:
\[ 10 + 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from all reservations in one night:
- The restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, so the total revenue for one night is:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total weekly revenue is:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount the restaurant makes in a week is:

"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we first need to calculate the total selling price of all the watermelons, and then divide that by the number of watermelons.

1. Calculate the total cost of the watermelons:
   - The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.

2. Calculate the total profit:
   - The profit is 25% of the total cost.
   - Total profit = 25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20.

3. Calculate the total selling price:
   - Total selling price = Total cost + Total profit = $80 + $20 = $100.

4. Calculate the selling price per watermelon:
   - Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons = $100 / 50 = $2.

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.

1. **Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour = \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges} \).

2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour = \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges} \).

3. **Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:**
   - Difference = Number of oranges Ana can peel - Number of oranges Jane can peel
   - Difference = 20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original price is $400, and he gets it for 80% off:

\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

This is the discount amount. So, the price he pays for the radiator is:

\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours:

\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor to find the total amount Mark paid:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens.
2. Let \( k \) represent the number of cows.

We know the following:
- The total number of animals is 20.
- The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can write the equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).
