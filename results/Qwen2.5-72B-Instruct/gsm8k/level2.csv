"To determine the total number of bolts needed for a robe, we need to consider both the blue and white fibers.

1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The robe requires half as many bolts of white fiber as blue fiber. Therefore, the number of bolts of white fiber is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt}
   \]

3. To find the total number of bolts, we add the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber:
   \[
   2 \text{ bolts (blue)} + 1 \text{ bolt (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts}
   \]

Thus, the total number of bolts needed for the robe is:
\[
3

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the house including the purchase price and the repairs.
2. Determine the new value of the house after the repairs.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the house.**

The purchase price of the house is $80,000, and the cost of repairs is $50,000. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the new value of the house after the repairs.**

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. To find the new value, we first need to calculate 150% of the original value of the house (which is $80,000).

150% of $80,000 is:
\[ 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

The new value of the house is the original value plus the increase:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**

The profit is the new value of the house minus the total cost:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, Josh's profit is:
\[ 70,000 \]"
"To find out how many total meters James runs a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total meters James runs in one session:
   - James runs 3 sprints each session.
   - Each sprint is 60 meters.
   - Total meters per session = 3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters.

2. Calculate the total meters James runs in a week:
   - James runs 3 times a week.
   - Total meters per week = 3 sessions/week * 180 meters/session = 540 meters.

Therefore, the total meters James runs a week is 540 meters.

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken needs per day:
   Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day.

2. Calculate the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock per day:
   Since Wendi has 20 chickens, the total feed needed per day is:
   \[
   3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
   In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed.
   In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups of feed.
   The total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
   \[
   15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
   \]

4. Calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal:
   The total feed needed for the day is 60 cups, and 40 cups have already been given. Therefore, the amount of feed needed for the final meal is:
   \[
   60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups}
   \]

Thus, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of 16 glasses, where every second glass is sold at a 60% discount.

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.
2. The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.
3. This pattern repeats for every pair of glasses.

Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses by 2 to find the number of pairs:
\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

Each pair consists of one full-price glass and one discounted glass:
- Cost of one full-price glass: $5
- Cost of one discounted glass: $3

The total cost for one pair of glasses is:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there are 8 pairs, the total cost for 16 glasses is:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay:
\[ 64 \text{ dollars} \]

"Let's denote the number of sheep in Seattle as \( S \), in Charleston as \( C \), and in Toulouse as \( T \).

Given:
- Seattle has 20 sheep, so \( S = 20 \).
- Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so \( C = 4S \).
- Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so \( T = 2C \).

First, calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:
\[ C = 4S = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:
\[ T = 2C = 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Now, add the number of sheep in all three cities:
\[ S + C + T = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 \]

The total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file.
2. Add the time taken for the Windows restart.
3. Add the time to download the entire file again.

First, calculate 40% of the 200 GB file:
\[ 0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB} \]

Next, calculate the time to download 80 GB at a rate of 2 GB/minute:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Add the 20 minutes for the Windows restart:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, add the time to download the entire 200 GB file again:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Total time:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \text{ minutes} \]

"First, let's calculate the distance John travels initially. He drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how far he travels on his return trip. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time. For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After the half-hour, he drives the remaining 1.5 hours at 80 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

The total distance he covers on his return trip is:
\[ 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Since he initially traveled 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of the 4 hours is:
\[ 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total net profit becomes positive.

1. **Initial Cost**: The initial cost to plant the tree is $90.
2. **Annual Revenue**: Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Cost**: The annual cost to water and feed the tree is $3.
4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit each year is the annual revenue minus the annual cost:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]
5. **Total Net Profit**: To find the number of years it takes for the total net profit to cover the initial cost, we set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Total Net Profit} = \text{Net Annual Profit} \times \text{Number of Years} - \text{Initial Cost}
   \]
   We need the total net profit to be at least $0:
   \[
   7.5 \times \text{Number of Years} - 90 \geq 0
   \]
6. **Solving for the Number of Years**:
   \[
   7.5 \times \text{Number of Years} \geq 90
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of Years} \geq \frac{90}{7.5}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of Years} \geq 12
   \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. **Green House:**
   - She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.
   - Number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house: \( \frac{x}{3} \).
   - Number of vacuum cleaners left after the green house: \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \).

2. **Red House:**
   - She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house.
   - Number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house: \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).

3. **Orange House:**
   - She sold half of what was left at the orange house.
   - Number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house: \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).
   - Number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house: \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).

4. **Final Condition:**
   - Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \).

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
\]

Multiply both sides by 2:

\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
\]

Add 2 to both sides:

\[
\frac{2x}{3} = 12
\]

Multiply both sides by 3:

\[
2x = 36
\]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[
x = 18

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we first need to calculate the total time she should take to complete the 12-mile trail.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given:
- Total Distance = 12 miles
- Desired Average Speed = 4 miles per hour

We can rearrange the formula to solve for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours hiking the first 6 miles (1 hour for the first 4 miles and another hour for the next 2 miles). Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the trail is:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = \text{Total Time} - \text{Time Already Spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to cover is:
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = \text{Total Distance} - \text{Distance Already Covered} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Required Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"First, let's determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in it is:
\[ 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Next, since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, the remaining amount of orange drink is:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
\[ 9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Now, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in it is:
\[ 15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

When the 9 liters of orange drink and 15 liters of pineapple drink are combined, the total volume is:
\[ 9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water in the 24 liters of the mixture is the sum of the water from the orange drink and the pineapple drink:
\[ 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
\[ 15 \text{ liters} \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered, excluding the pizza.

1. The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is:
\[ 12 + 15 + 6 = 33 \text{ dollars} \]

Marie paid a total of $50. To find out how much she spent on pizza, we subtract the total cost of the other items from $50:
\[ 50 - 33 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the total amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[ \frac{17}{8.50} = 2 \]

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings.
Cynthia eats 1 serving per day. Over 60 days, she will consume:
\[ 1 \text{ serving/day} \times 60 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ servings} \]

Step 2: Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need.
Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons are needed for 60 servings:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost.
Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:

"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to consider the distances mentioned in the problem.

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip. This means his second stop was at \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles.

The distance between the first stop (20 miles) and the second stop (45 miles) is:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \]

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. One pair of heels costs $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots, we can write the equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Therefore, the boots cost 104 dollars.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let \( D \) be Darrell's age and \( A \) be Allen's age. According to the problem, the ratio of their ages is 7:11, which can be written as:

\[ \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11} \]

This implies:

\[ D = \frac{7}{11}A \]

We are also given that the sum of their ages is 162:

\[ D + A = 162 \]

Substituting \( D = \frac{7}{11}A \) into the equation \( D + A = 162 \):

\[ \frac{7}{11}A + A = 162 \]

To combine the terms on the left side, we need a common denominator:

\[ \frac{7A + 11A}{11} = 162 \]

\[ \frac{18A}{11} = 162 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \) by multiplying both sides by 11:

\[ 18A = 162 \times 11 \]

\[ 18A = 1782 \]

Now, divide both sides by 18:

\[ A = \frac{1782}{18} \]

\[ A = 99 \]

So, Allen's current age is 99. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is:

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is:

\]

Adding 5 more jewels to this amount gives us the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Thus, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours, given the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's skipping speed and use it to find her running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping speed is half as fast as running speed.
   - Therefore, running speed = 2 * skipping speed = 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running speed is four times faster than walking speed.
   - Therefore, walking speed = running speed / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time = 6 hours.
   - Time spent running = one-third of total time = 6 / 3 = 2 hours.
   - Time spent walking = two-thirds of total time = 2 * (6 / 3) = 4 hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance running = running speed * time spent running = 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Distance walking = walking speed * time spent walking = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = distance running + distance walking = 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles.

"First, let's determine the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips. Since there are 5 servings in the bag and each serving has 250 calories, the total number of calories in the bag is:
\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily target of 2000 calories. Since you have already consumed 1800 calories, the remaining calories you can consume are:
\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories. Since the entire 300g bag has 1250 calories, the number of calories per gram is:
\[ \frac{1250 \text{ calories}}{300 \text{ grams}} = \frac{1250}{300} \approx 4.17 \text{ calories/gram} \]

To find out how many grams of chips 200 calories represent, we use the following calculation:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{4.17 \text{ calories/gram}} \approx 47.96 \text{ grams} \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, you can eat approximately 48 grams of chips.

"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of making 20 candles.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of making 20 candles.**

- Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax.
- To make 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds).
- The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.
- Therefore, the cost for 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.**

- Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
- The total revenue from selling 20 candles is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

**Step 3: Calculate the net profit.**

- Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
- Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is $20.00.

"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Post-it notes in the purse**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. **Post-it notes used at work**: She placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 cups of coffee.
3. **Post-it notes remaining**: After placing the Post-it notes on the cups, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it notes Candice had before using them is the sum of the initial Post-it notes and the Post-it notes in the package:
\[ 80 + x \]

The number of Post-it notes used is 220, and the number of Post-it notes remaining is 23. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Thus, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is:

"First, we determine the number of blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, we add the amount spent on blue ties to the amount spent on red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-leveled sandcastle, we need to determine the square footage of each level and then calculate the average.

Given:
- The top level (Level 4) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level has half the square footage of the level below it.

Let's denote the square footage of the levels as follows:
- Level 4: \( S_4 = 16 \)
- Level 3: \( S_3 = 2 \times S_4 = 2 \times 16 = 32 \)
- Level 2: \( S_2 = 2 \times S_3 = 2 \times 32 = 64 \)
- Level 1: \( S_1 = 2 \times S_2 = 2 \times 64 = 128 \)

Now, we sum the square footages of all levels:
\[ S_1 + S_2 + S_3 + S_4 = 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = 240 \]

To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:

"First, we determine the amount of laundry each person does based on the information given.

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, David does:
   \[
   \text{David's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, Raymond does:
   \[
   \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{2} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
\[

"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the total cost of buying the flowers in packages of 3 and in packages of 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 18 / 3 = 6 packages.
- The total cost for 6 packages is 6 * $2.50 = $15.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.00.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 18 / 2 = 9 packages.
- The total cost for 9 packages is 9 * $1.00 = $9.00.

Now, we compare the two total costs:
- The cost for packages of 3 is $15.00.
- The cost for packages of 2 is $9.00.

The savings by buying the flowers in packages of 2 instead of packages of 3 is:
$15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00

Therefore, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Next, solve for \( L \):
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, substitute \( L = 7 \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To determine how many pounds of potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad that both the adult and child dinosaurs will consume.

1. Calculate the amount of potato salad consumed by the adults:
   - Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
   - There are 20 adult dinosaurs.
   - Total potato salad for adults = 10 lbs/adult * 20 adults = 200 lbs.

2. Calculate the amount of potato salad consumed by the children:
   - Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad.
   - There are 5 child dinosaurs.
   - Total potato salad for children = 5 lbs/child * 5 children = 25 lbs.

3. Calculate the total amount of potato salad needed:

"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- \( x \) cars drove through in the first 15 minutes.
- 20 more cars drove through in the next 15 minutes.
- 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.
- Originally, there were 30 cars on the motorway.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that were originally on the motorway minus the cars that took an exit is \( 30 - 5 = 25 \).

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is equal to the number of cars that were left after some took the exit, we have:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of one box and then calculate its inner volume. Finally, we will multiply this volume by 3 to get the total inner volume for all boxes.

1. **Determine the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) inches
   - Inner width: \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) inches
   - Inner height: \( 4 - 2 = 2 \) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - Inner volume = Inner length × Inner width × Inner height
   - Inner volume = \( 3 \) inches × \( 4 \) inches × \( 2 \) inches
   - Inner volume = \( 24 \) cubic inches

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box × Number of boxes
   - Total inner volume = \( 24 \) cubic inches × 3
   - Total inner volume = \( 72 \) cubic inches

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total TV watching time for each day and then solve for Wednesday.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: \( x \) (30-minute episodes)
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hour = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

The total time spent watching TV is 7 hours. We can set up the equation:

\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \]

Combine the constants:

\[ 5.5 + 0.5x = 7 \]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[ 0.5x = 1.5 \]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[ x = 3 \]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30-minute shows on Wednesday.

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, Henry intended to bake twice as many cookies as last year, which would be \( 2x \).

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, leaving him with 110 cookies. Therefore, before dropping the cookies, he had \( 110 + 5 = 115 \) cookies.

We can set up the equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 115 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 115 \]
\[ 2x = 115 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 100 \]
\[ x = \frac{100}{2} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue she earns from selling it at the new price.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- She has 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10, each costing $10.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]
- She has 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10, each costing $16.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]
- The total cost of all the lumber is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the selling price of the lumber:
- The price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards has increased by 50%, so the new price is:
  \[
  \$10 + 0.5 \times \$10 = \$15
  \]
- The price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards has also increased by 50%, so the new price is:
  \[
  \$16 + 0.5 \times \$16 = \$24
  \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:
- Revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]
- Revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]
- The total revenue is:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270
  \]

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
  \[
  \$270 - \$180 = \$90
  \]

Thus, Sasha's profit is:
\[
\boxed{90}

"First, let's determine Lylah's salary four years ago. If Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, and Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]
\[ 40000 = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = 30769.23 \]

Next, we calculate Adrien's salary four years later. His salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Assuming Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), we calculate her new salary:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add both of their new salaries to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:

\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

"Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as \( B \) and the number of pink gumballs as \( P \).

According to the problem, there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. This can be expressed with the equation:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

We are given that there are 12 blue gumballs, so \( B = 12 \).

Substitute \( B = 12 \) into the equation:
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, the number of pink gumballs is 70.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know the total number of cars and the number of automatic and manual cars:

- Total cars: 20
- Automatic cars: 12
- Manual cars: 4

The number of semi-automatic cars is the total number of cars minus the number of automatic and manual cars:
\[ 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( W = 2B \) (there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
2. \( B = 2Q \) (there are twice as many baby bees as queens)

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, so:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting the relationships into the total number of bees equation:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) in the equation:
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, we can find \( B \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

And finally, we can find \( W \):
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:

"First, let's identify the items and their costs:
- Milk: $2 (food)
- Eggs: $3 (food)
- Light bulbs: $3 (nonfood)
- Cups: $3 (nonfood)
- Roach traps: $4 (nonfood)

Next, calculate the total cost of the food items:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
Total food cost = $2 + $3 = $5

Now, calculate the total cost of the nonfood items:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
Total nonfood cost = $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Calculate the tax on the nonfood items:
- Tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount = 10% of $10 = 0.10 * $10 = $1

Add the tax to the total nonfood cost:
- Total nonfood cost with tax = $10 + $1 = $11

Finally, add the total food cost and the total nonfood cost with tax:
- Total cost = Total food cost + Total nonfood cost with tax

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare per year.
2. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare per year by the total number of hectares John has.

First, since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, he can harvest 4 times a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests per year).

Next, we calculate the number of pineapples per hectare per year:
100 pineapples/hectare * 4 harvests/year = 400 pineapples/hectare/year

Now, we multiply the number of pineapples per hectare per year by the total number of hectares:

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - 1/2 of the 30 bees return.
   - \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees return.

3. **Following 6 hours:**
   - Two times as many bees as the 30 that left first leave the hive.
   - \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees leave.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive.
   - Bees that left initially: 30
   - Bees that returned: 15
   - Bees that left again: 60
   - Total bees that left and didn't return yet: \( 30 + 60 - 15 = 75 \)

1. **Bicycles:**
   - Each bicycle has 2 tires.
   - 5 people came by, so the total number of bicycle tires is \(5 \times 2 = 10\).
   - Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total cost for the bicycle tires is \(10 \times 0.25 = 2.50\) dollars.

2. **Tricycles:**
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - 3 people came by, so the total number of tricycle tires is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
   - Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total cost for the tricycle tires is \(9 \times 0.25 = 2.25\) dollars.

3. **Unicycle:**
   - A unicycle has 1 tire.
   - 1 person came by, so the total number of unicycle tires is \(1 \times 1 = 1\).
   - Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total cost for the unicycle tire is \(1 \times 0.25 = 0.25\) dollars.

Now, we add up the total earnings from all the tires:

"Let's denote the total number of fries Dave bought as \( F \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries in total.
4. After the seagull and pigeons, the number of fries left is \( F - 14 - 7 - 9 = F - 30 \).
5. A raccoon then stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, so the raccoon ate \( \frac{2}{3} \times (F - 30) \) fries.
6. After the raccoon, the number of fries left is \( \frac{1}{3} \times (F - 30) \).
7. Ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries left.
8. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{3} \times (F - 30) = 6 \).

Now, solve for \( F \):
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times (F - 30) = 6 \]
\[ F - 30 = 18 \]
\[ F = 48 \]

So, the total number of fries Dave bought is \( 48 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

1. **Identify the initial price and the rate of increase:**
   - Initial price (P0) = $20
   - Rate of increase (r) = 20% = 0.20

2. **Determine the number of periods (n) over which the price increases:**
   - Since the price increases every two months, the number of periods in 36 months is \( n = \frac{36}{2} = 18 \).

3. **Use the formula for exponential growth:**
   The formula for the price after n periods is:
   \[
   P = P0 \times (1 + r)^n

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we add up the ages of all four birds:
\[ 8 \text{ (Sally Four)} + 8 \text{ (Sally Thirtytwo)} + 16 \text{ (Granny Red)} + 19 \text{ (Sally Two)} = 51 \]

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"To determine how much Jessica will pay in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum on all her debts, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payment and then find 50% more than that amount.

1. Calculate the total minimum monthly payment:
   - Student loans: $300/month
   - Credit card: $200/month
   - Mortgage: $500/month

   Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

2. Calculate 50% more than the total minimum monthly payment:
   - 50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

   Total monthly payment with 50% more = $1000 + $500 = $1500/month

3. Calculate the total annual payment:
   - Total annual payment = $1500/month * 12 months/year = $18000/year

"First, let's calculate the amount Zaid spends on rent and car fuel:

- Rent: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \) dollars
- Car fuel: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \) dollars

Total spent on rent and car fuel:
\[ 1500 + 2000 = 3500 \] dollars

Next, we calculate the remaining amount after these expenses:
\[ 6000 - 3500 = 2500 \] dollars

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \] dollars

The remaining amount after the donation:
\[ 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \] dollars

Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars:
\[ 200 + 700 = 900 \] dollars

The remaining amount after giving money to his daughter and wife:

"Let's denote the current ages of Jean, Mark, and Jan as \( J \), \( M \), and \( 30 \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Jean is two years older than Mark:
   \[
   J = M + 2
   \]

2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age:
   \[
   M - 2 = 5 + \frac{1}{2}(30 - 2)
   \]

First, simplify the equation for Mark's age two years ago:
\[
M - 2 = 5 + \frac{1}{2} \times 28
\]
\[
M - 2 = 5 + 14
\]
\[
M - 2 = 19
\]
\[
M = 21
\]

Now, substitute \( M = 21 \) into the equation for Jean's age:
\[
J = M + 2
\]
\[
J = 21 + 2
\]
\[
J = 23
\]

Thus, Jean is 23 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then determine how much more likely one event is compared to the other, expressed as a percentage.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability \( P(\text{number} > 3) \) is:
     \[
     P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
     \]

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on one roll is:
     \[
     P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
     \]
   - Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
     \[
     P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
     \]

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.
   - To find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3, we calculate the ratio of the two probabilities:
     \[
     \text{Ratio} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
     \]
   - This means it is 2 times more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
   - To express this as a percentage, we convert the ratio to a percentage:
     \[
     2 \times 100\% = 200\%
     \]

Thus, it is 200% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of rats in each cage based on the total distribution of straw.

1. **Calculate the total straw used for the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces.

2. **Calculate the total straw used for the rabbits:**
   - There is a pen of rabbits with 20 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for rabbits = 20 pieces.

3. **Calculate the total straw used for the rats:**
   - The total straw distributed among all the rodents is 160 pieces.
   - Straw used for hamsters and rabbits = \(50 + 20 = 70\) pieces.
   - Straw used for rats = \(160 - 70 = 90\) pieces.

4. **Determine the number of rats:**
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( r \) be the total number of rats.
   - Total straw for rats = \(6r = 90\).
   - Solving for \( r \): \( r = \frac{90}{6} = 15 \).

5. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**

"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n periods, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years.

In this case:
- \( P = 100 \) (the principal amount)
- \( r = 0.02 \) (the monthly interest rate)
- \( n = 1 \) (since interest is compounded monthly)
- \( t = 3 \) (the time in months)

Since the interest is compounded monthly, we can simplify the formula to:

\[ A = P (1 + r)^t \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ A = 100 (1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 (1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]
\[ A = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, Mandy should give Benedict:

The selling price per bag is $30. Therefore, the profit per bag is:
\[ 30 - 22 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

The total profit made by the trader is $400. Since the profit per bag is $8, the number of bags sold can be calculated as:
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

Thus, the trader sold 50 bags.

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate his earnings from both publishers and then sum them up.

1. **Determine the number of sentences edited for each publisher:**
   Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:
   \[
   \frac{1000 \text{ sentences}}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences per publisher}
   \]

2. **Calculate the payment from Publisher A:**
   Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, for 500 sentences, the payment is:
   \[
   500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Calculate the payment from Publisher B:**
   Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, which is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence}
   \]
   Therefore, for 500 sentences, the payment is:
   \[
   500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weekly earnings:**
   Adding the payments from both publishers:

"To find out how many pens Janet has now, we need to add the number of green and yellow pens she originally had to the total number of blue and red pens she bought.

1. Calculate the total number of blue pens:
   - Janet bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag.
   - \(6 \times 9 = 54\) blue pens.

2. Calculate the total number of red pens:
   - Janet bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag.
   - \(2 \times 6 = 12\) red pens.

3. Add the number of green and yellow pens:
   - Janet originally had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens.
   - \(22 + 10 = 32\) green and yellow pens.

4. Add all the pens together:
   - Total pens = green and yellow pens + blue pens + red pens
   - Total pens = \(32 + 54 + 12 = 98\)

So, Janet has 98 pens now.

"To determine the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the lowest score among the first five tests:**
   - Scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86
   - The lowest score is 71.

2. **Calculate the sum of the remaining four scores:**
   - Sum of the remaining scores: 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367

3. **Determine the total sum needed for an average of 93 with five tests:**
   - Average of 93 with five tests: \( 93 \times 5 = 465 \)

4. **Calculate the score needed on the sixth test:**
   - Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test.
   - The sum of the five highest scores (including the sixth test) should be 465.
   - Therefore, \( 367 + x = 465 \)

"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance for each period and then sum them up.

First, for the initial four weeks:
- He rides 5 times a week.
- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- Total distance per week = 5 rides/week * 25 km/ride = 125 km/week.
- Total distance for four weeks = 125 km/week * 4 weeks = 500 km.

Next, for the following three weeks:
- He rides 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- Total distance per week = 2 rides/week * 60 km/ride = 120 km/week.
- Total distance for three weeks = 120 km/week * 3 weeks = 360 km.

Finally, the total distance for the entire period:
- Total distance = 500 km + 360 km = 860 km.

\[4 + 12 + 60 = 76\]

Therefore, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of each cup. Let's break down the information given:

1. Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each.
2. First, calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of half a dozen plates} = 6 \times 6000 = 36000
   \]
3. According to the problem, twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than this amount:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of twenty dozen cups} = 36000 - 1200 = 34800
   \]
4. Next, we need to find the cost of one cup. Since twenty dozen cups are equivalent to 240 cups (because one dozen equals 12):
   \[
   \text{Total number of cups} = 20 \times 12 = 240
   \]
5. The cost of each cup is:
   \[
   \text{Cost per cup} = \frac{34800}{240} = 145
   \]

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is:
\[

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The cost of the jacket is $30, and the cost of each pair of shoes is $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket, the total cost is:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the additional amount she needs is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her total earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her initial savings, the total amount she has is:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

The remaining amount she needs to earn is:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn:
\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of eggs collected each day is 42.
2. There are two more white chickens than red chickens.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
1. \( 3r + 5w = 42 \) (total eggs equation)
2. \( w = r + 2 \) (relationship between the number of chickens)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( r \):
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substitute the perimeter and Gary's walking speed into the formula:

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the first day.
2. Calculate the number of customers on the second day.
3. Use the total number of customers over the three days to find the number of customers on the third day.

From the problem:
- The number of customers on the first day is 100.
- The number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day, which is \(100 + 50 = 150\).
- The total number of customers over the three days is 500.

Let \( x \) be the number of customers on the third day. We can set up the equation:
\[ 100 + 150 + x = 500 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 250 + x = 500 \]
\[ x = 500 - 250 \]
\[ x = 250 \]

So, the number of customers on the third day is 250.

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

Given that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons and the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ 352.00 \div 8.00 = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours to make her purchase.

"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay back. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount.

The additional 10% of $2000 is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she needs to pay back is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount she will pay over 12 months if she pays $165 each month:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to pay back:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Thus, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:

   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
1. Harriet's age in three years:
   \[

"First, let's determine the total number of Pokemon cards James has initially:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

Total initial cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Next, we account for the changes:
- James loses 8 water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards
- James buys 14 grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

Now, we calculate the new total number of cards:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

Total new cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Calculating the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Converting to a percentage:

"Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as \( R \). According to the problem:

- John has twice as many candies as Robert, so John has \( 2R \) candies.
- John has 54 candies, so \( 2R = 54 \).
- Solving for \( R \), we get \( R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \).

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has \( R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \) candies.

Now, we need to find how many more candies John has than James:
- John has 54 candies, and James has 33 candies.
- The difference is \( 54 - 33 = 21 \).

"First, let's determine how many pen pals Mike still has:
- Mike originally had 5 pen pals.
- He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
- Therefore, he now has \(5 - 2 = 3\) pen pals.

Next, we calculate the number of letters Mike receives each week:
- Each of his 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week.
- So, he receives \(3 \times 2 = 6\) letters a week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages Mike receives each week is:
- \(6 \times 5 = 30\) pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages each week.

Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time he spends writing each week is:
- \(30 \times 6 = 180\) minutes.

To convert this time into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
- \(180 \div 60 = 3\) hours.

Thus, Mike spends 3 hours writing each week.

"To determine how many minutes Jason has left in his phone plan, we need to calculate the total minutes he has used and subtract that from his monthly allowance.

1. **Daily calls with the boss:**
   - Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day.
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - Total minutes for boss calls: \( 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Extra calls to other people:**
   - Jason has used an additional 300 minutes for calls to other people.

3. **Total minutes used:**
   - Total minutes used = Minutes for boss calls + Extra minutes
   - Total minutes used = \( 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Minutes remaining:**
   - Jason's monthly allowance is 1000 minutes.
   - Minutes remaining = Monthly allowance - Total minutes used
   - Minutes remaining = \( 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \).

Thus, the number of minutes Jason has left is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin.
   - Griffin now has \( 24 - 5 = 19 \) fries.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle.
   - Billy took \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) fries.
   - Griffin now has \( 19 - 10 = 9 \) fries.
4. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries.
5. Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken.
   - Colby took \( 5 - 3 = 2 \) fries.
   - Griffin now has \( 9 - 2 = 7 \) fries before Ginger gave him any fries.
6. In the end, Griffin had 27 fries.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin.
   - Therefore, \( 7 + x = 27 \).

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 27 - 7 \]
\[ x = 20 \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"First, we determine the initial number of cows in each stall. Each of the ten stalls has 20 cows, so the total number of cows initially is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the twenty stalls. The number of new cows added to each stall is:
\[ \frac{40}{20} = 2 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of cows in each stall after the new cows are added. Initially, each of the ten stalls had 20 cows, and now each of these ten stalls will have:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \]

The other ten stalls initially had 0 cows, and now each of these ten stalls will have:
\[ 0 + 2 = 2 \]

To find the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we need to consider the distribution. If we assume 4 of the 8 stalls are from the group that initially had 20 cows and 4 are from the group that initially had 0 cows, the total number of cows in these 8 stalls is:
\[ 4 \times 22 + 4 \times 2 = 88 + 8 = 96 \]

"To find the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight to find the remaining weight.

**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.**

- The tree is 200 feet tall.
- Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.
- The number of 10-foot sections in a 200-foot tree is \( \frac{200}{10} = 20 \) sections.
- Therefore, the total weight of the tree is \( 20 \times 400 = 8000 \) pounds.

**Step 2: Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.**

- The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood.
- 30% of 8000 pounds is \( 0.30 \times 8000 = 2400 \) pounds.

**Step 3: Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight to find the remaining weight.**

- The remaining weight of the tree is \( 8000 - 2400 = 5600 \) pounds.

The final weight of the redwood tree is 5600 pounds.

"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: \( A_a = J_a + 8 \)
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: \( A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \)
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: \( J_b = J_a + 4 \)
4. Andrea has 52 apples: \( A_a = 52 \)

First, we use the information that Andrea has 52 apples to find the number of apples Jamal has:
\[ A_a = J_a + 8 \]
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Next, we use the number of apples Jamal has to find the number of bananas Jamal has:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 48 \]

Now, we can find the number of bananas Andrea has:
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ A_b = 24 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of fruits:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = A_a + A_b + J_a + J_b \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we first calculate the amount needed for each day and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the amount of flour needed for 36 cookies:
   - Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, we can find the amount needed for 36 cookies by setting up a proportion:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{36 \text{ cookies}}
   \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 36 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = 6 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. Calculate the amount of flour needed for 30 cookies:
   - Similarly, we set up a proportion for 30 cookies:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{y \text{ cups}}{30 \text{ cookies}}
   \]
   - Solving for \( y \):
   \[
   y = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 30 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = 5 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. Add the amounts of flour needed for both days:
   \[
   6 \text{ cups} + 5 \text{ cups} = 11 \text{ cups}

2. The collar takes a tenth of the body, which is \(900 / 10 = 90\) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is \(2 \times 90 = 180\) stitches.
4. The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 \text{ (body)} + 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 1170 \text{ stitches} \]

The remaining stitches are for the two sleeves:
\[ 1800 \text{ (total)} - 1170 \text{ (body, collar, rosette)} = 630 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches per sleeve is:
\[ 630 \text{ stitches} / 2 = 315 \text{ stitches} \]

Thus, each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

"First, we calculate the number of cards with the letter A on them:
\[ \text{Number of A cards} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining cards after the A cards are accounted for:
\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Then, we calculate the number of cards with the letter B on them from the remaining cards:
\[ \text{Number of B cards} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

We then find the number of remaining cards after the B cards are accounted for:
\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Next, we calculate the number of cards with the letter C on them from the remaining cards:
\[ \text{Number of C cards} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of spots a mamba has. We know that a cobra has 70 spots and that this is twice the number of spots a mamba has. Therefore, a mamba has:

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ spots} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, and 60 mambas, each with 35 spots. The total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \text{ spots} \]

The total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \text{ spots} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \text{ spots} \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

"To find out how many rows of 5 stars are on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars in the rows that are not 5-star rows.

There are three rows of 8 stars each, so:
3 rows * 8 stars/row = 24 stars

There are two rows of 6 stars each, so:
2 rows * 6 stars/row = 12 stars

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars

The flag has 76 stars in total, so the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:
76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars

To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5:
40 stars / 5 stars/row = 8 rows

Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

"First, let's determine the points each player has after 3 rounds:
- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we consider the fourth round where each player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points:
- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point: \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point: \(18\) points.
- Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point: \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

"To determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how much weight Joey loses in one week.
2. Determine how much weight Sandy needs to lose to match Joey's total weight loss.
3. Calculate how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose that amount of weight.

First, we find out how much weight Joey loses in one week:
- Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks.
- Therefore, Joey loses \( \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \).

Next, we determine the total weight loss for both:
- Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks.
- Sandy needs to lose the same 8 pounds.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week, we calculate Sandy's weekly weight loss:
- Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.
- Therefore, Sandy loses \( \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week} \).

Now, we calculate how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds:
- Sandy needs to lose 8 pounds.
- Sandy loses 0.5 pounds per week.
- Therefore, it will take \( \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks} \).

Thus, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

"To determine the total number of new limbs a person will grow after drinking Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum over a period of fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of new arms and new legs separately and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the number of new arms:**
   - A person grows an extra arm every 3 days.
   - Over 15 days, the number of new arms is calculated by dividing 15 by 3.
   - \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \) new arms.

2. **Calculate the number of new legs:**
   - A person grows an extra leg every 5 days.
   - Over 15 days, the number of new legs is calculated by dividing 15 by 5.
   - \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \) new legs.

3. **Calculate the total number of new limbs:**
   - Total new limbs = number of new arms + number of new legs.
   - Total new limbs = 5 + 3 = 8.

Thus, after fifteen days, the person will have grown 8 new limbs.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 suits * $100/suit = $600

Next, the total cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150

Now, the cost of the flight ticket:
$700 + (5 * $100) = $700 + $500 = $1200

Adding up all the expenses so far:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight) = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the total amount he plans to use for expenses and savings is:
$6000 - $2000 = $4000

Subtracting the expenses from the amount he plans to use:
$4000 - $1950 = $2050

Therefore, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile based on the given information.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Currently, Cera is 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, Noah is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age.
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half what it is now.

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \). According to the problem:

- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{1}{2}D \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3.5D = 105 \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness, which is 8 people.

Then, we calculate the number of people who had previous commitments, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \]

So, the total number of people who couldn't attend is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June after taking his coach's advice, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson needs to run each day as per his coach's advice.
2. Determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after the increase.
3. Calculate the total distance run in June, which has 30 days.

Step 1: Calculate the additional distance Tyson needs to run each day.
The coach wants Tyson to run \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more meters each day. Therefore, the additional distance is:
\[ 5000 \times \frac{1}{5} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

Step 2: Determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after the increase.
The new daily distance is:
\[ 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total distance run in June.
June has 30 days, so the total distance Tyson runs in June is:
\[ 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Thus, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:
180000"

"To find out how much money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Marisa receives in 5 days.
2. Calculate the total amount of money Marisa spends on lollipops in 5 days.
3. Subtract the total amount spent on lollipops from the total amount received to find out how much she saves.

Step 1: Total amount received in 5 days
Marisa receives $5 each day. Over 5 days, she receives:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 5 \text{ dollars/day} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: Total amount spent on lollipops in 5 days
Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and Marisa buys 4 lollipops each day. The cost per day is:
\[ 4 \text{ lollipops/day} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 1 \text{ dollar/day} \]
Over 5 days, the total cost is:

"First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05 and he bought 40 gumballs, the total cost for the gumballs is:
\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

This $2 is half of the change he received after buying the candy. Therefore, the total change he received is:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Billy started with $10, the amount he spent on candy is:
\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy he bought, we divide the amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:
\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the train travels in one complete trip and then determine how many days it can operate before reaching the 18,000-mile service interval.

1. **Calculate the distance from the third city to the first city:**
   - The combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city is \(75 + 100 = 175\) miles.
   - The distance from the third city to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

2. **Calculate the total distance for one complete trip:**
   - The total distance for one complete trip is \(75 + 100 + 125 = 300\) miles.

3. **Calculate the total distance traveled in one day:**
   - The train makes this trip 3 times a day, so the total distance traveled in one day is \(300 \times 3 = 900\) miles.

4. **Determine how many days the train can operate before reaching 18,000 miles:**
   - The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it can operate, we divide 18,000 miles by the daily distance traveled:
     \[

"First, we need to determine the amount of stuffing required for a collie bed. Since a collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed, we calculate the average of 8 pounds and 2 pounds:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:

\[
4 \text{ beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds/bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:

\[
3 \text{ beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds/bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the amounts of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds:

   \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\%}{12} \times 5 = \frac{10}{12} \times 5 = \frac{50}{12} \approx 4.17\%
   \]

2. **Calculate the total interest amount:**
   \[
   \text{Total interest} = 3650 \times \frac{4.17}{100} = 3650 \times 0.0417 = 152.445
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Total interest} = 3650 + 152.445 = 3802.445
   \]

4. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{\text{Total amount}}{\text{Number of months}} = \frac{3802.445}{5} = 760.489
   \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:
\[
760.49

"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Since Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, Anna has:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Since Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, Anna has:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos they have together.

Total silver pesos:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Total gold pesos:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos to find the total number of pesos they have together:
\[ 150 \text{ (silver pesos)} + 200 \text{ (gold pesos)} = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

Thus, the total number of pesos they have together is:

"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares. According to the problem, he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

"First, we determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we calculate:

Number of boys = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26
Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26

The performance is with only the female members, so initially, there are 26 girls performing.

On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can make it is:

Number of girls who can make it = 0.50 * 26 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people = Number of girls who can make it + Number of teachers
Total number of people = 13 + 3 = 16

"To determine how much money David saves, we need to compare the total cost of the rides for both David and Dasha.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Dasha:
- Each ride costs 2 ride tickets.
- Each ride ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \times 4 = 36\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for David:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.

Now, we compare the costs:
- Dasha's total cost: $36
- David's total cost: $30

The amount David saves is the difference between Dasha's total cost and David's total cost:
\[ 36 - 30 = 6 \]

"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have, which is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.

First, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

Next, we know the total number of popsicles is 165. We can find the value of one part of the ratio by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \( 5 \) parts, so:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
- Sam has \( 6 \) parts, so:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

     \]
   - With a 20% discount, the savings on the bundle is:
     \[
     20 \times 0.20 = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost of the bundle after the discount is:
     \[
     20 - 4 = 16 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total cost of all streaming services:**
   - Adding the cost of Netflix to the cost of the bundle:
     \[
     10 + 16 = 26 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Savings by cancelling the cable package:**
   - The cost of the cable package is $60 per month.
   - The total cost of the streaming services is $26 per month.
   - The savings is:
     \[
     60 - 26 = 34 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, Tim saves \(\boxed{34}\) dollars per month by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to the streaming services."

"First, let's determine how many slices Bill and Mark each receive.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill:
1/3 of 12 slices = 12 * (1/3) = 4 slices

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark:
1/4 of 12 slices = 12 * (1/4) = 3 slices

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices given to Bill and Mark:
4 slices (Bill) + 3 slices (Mark) = 7 slices

Jenny eats 2 slices, so we add these to the total number of slices already taken:
7 slices (given to Bill and Mark) + 2 slices (eaten by Jenny) = 9 slices

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices taken from the original number of slices to find out how many are left:
12 slices (original) - 9 slices (taken) = 3 slices

"To find out how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily energy usage before reduction:**
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour.
   - Mel uses it for 8 hours a day.
   - Daily energy usage = 900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watts/day.

2. **Convert daily energy usage to kilowatts:**
   - 1 kilowatt (kW) = 1000 watts.
   - Daily energy usage in kilowatts = 7200 watts / 1000 = 7.2 kW/day.

3. **Calculate the daily energy usage after reduction:**
   - Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, so he uses the air conditioner for 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day.
   - Daily energy usage after reduction = 900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watts/day.
   - Daily energy usage in kilowatts after reduction = 2700 watts / 1000 = 2.7 kW/day.

4. **Calculate the daily energy savings:**
   - Daily energy savings = 7.2 kW/day - 2.7 kW/day = 4.5 kW/day.

5. **Calculate the total energy savings over 30 days:**

1. Calculate the number of sandwiches needed to serve 20 people.
2. Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.
3. Calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of sandwiches needed.**
Each sandwich serves 4 people. Therefore, for 20 people:
\[ \text{Number of sandwiches} = \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.**
Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches:
\[ \text{Total meat required} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{Total cheese required} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese.**

"First, we determine the initial number of corns and cannolis at Allan's house. According to the problem, Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis. Therefore, the number of corns is:

\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan buys 60 more cannolis, so the new number of cannolis is:

\[ 40 + 60 = 100 \]

After buying the additional cannolis, Allan also buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he now has. Therefore, the number of corns he buys is:

\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Adding these 60 corns to the initial 80 corns, the new number of corns is:

\[ 80 + 60 = 140 \]

Now, we find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:

\[ 140 + 100 = 240 \]

Thus, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks before the discount. The first package costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is $800.

The total cost of these two packages before the discount is:
\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the $1200:
\[ 1200 \times 0.20 = 240 \]

So, the discount amount is $240. Subtracting this from the original total gives:
\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150:
\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:
\[ 1110 \]

"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies Shannon will eat in 30 days.
   - Shannon eats 2 cookies a night.
   - Over 30 days, she will eat \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) cookies.

2. Determine how many dozens of cookies are needed to make 60 cookies.
   - Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by 12.
   - \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) dozens.

Therefore, Shannon will need to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog.

1. **Determine the probability of a candle exploding:**
   - Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means the probability of a candle exploding is \(1 - 0.99 = 0.01\) or 1%.

2. **Determine the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog given that it is one of the more dangerous candles:**
   - 5% of the more dangerous candles (those that can explode) have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. This probability is 0.05.

3. **Calculate the number of candles that explode:**
   - If Marcy makes 50,000 candles, the number of candles that explode is:
     \[
     50,000 \times 0.01 = 500
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog:**
   - Out of the 500 candles that explode, 5% of them will also smell like wet dog:
     \[
     500 \times 0.05 = 25
     \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 25.

"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as \( x \).

First, we calculate the number of apples Joanne gathers:
- From the tallest trees: 30 apples
- From the shortest trees: \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples
- From the average trees: \( x \) apples

So, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
\[ 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x \]

Next, we calculate the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers:
- From the tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples
- From the shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples
- From the average trees: 0 apples

So, the total number of apples Joanne's sister gathers is:
\[ 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \]

The combined total number of apples gathered by both sisters is:
\[ (45 + x) + 105 = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

Thus, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is:

"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we have two equations based on the given information:
1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 180:
   \[
   C + D = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304, with camels having 2 humps each and dromedaries having 1 hump each:
   \[
   2C + D = 304
   \]

We can solve these equations simultaneously. First, we can express \( D \) from the first equation:
\[
D = 180 - C
\]

Next, substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[
2C + (180 - C) = 304
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2C + 180 - C = 304
\]
\[
C + 180 = 304
\]
\[
C = 304 - 180
\]
\[
C = 124
\]

Now, substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the equation \( D = 180 - C \):
\[
D = 180 - 124
\]
\[
D = 56
\]

Thus, the number of dromedaries is:
\[
\boxed{56}

   - Distance per day: 200 kilometers
   - Total distance for 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \)

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Total distance for these 2 days: 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days
   - 30% of 800 km: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \)

3. **Next 1 day:**
   - Distance traveled: 0 kilometers (he wasn't traveling at all)

4. **Second week (7 days):**
   - Distance per day: 300 kilometers
   - Total distance for 7 days: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \)

Now, sum all the distances:
- First 4 days: 800 km
- Next 2 days: 240 km
- Next 1 day: 0 km
- Second week: 2100 km

Total distance: \( 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \)

"To find out how big Timothy's locker is, we need to work backwards from the information given about the sizes of the lockers.

1. We know Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. Therefore, Zack's locker is 4 times the size of Peter's locker.
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. Therefore, Timothy's locker is 2 times the size of Zack's locker.

Next, we subtract the number of cats carried away by the boats from the initial number of cats on the rock:
\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \text{ cats} \]

Then, we determine how many of the remaining cats ran after the mouse. Since 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after the mouse:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \text{ cats} \]

Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ cats} \]

So, the number of cats left on the rock is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the original prices of the jeans:**
   - Let \( T \) be the original price of the tattered jeans.
   - Let \( J \) be the original price of the jogger jeans.
   - The tattered jeans were bought for $28, so the savings from the tattered jeans is \( T - 28 = 4 \).
   - The jogger jeans were bought for $22, so the savings from the jogger jeans is \( J - 22 = 2 \).

5. **Solve for the original prices:**
   - From the tattered jeans: \( T - 28 = 4 \) implies \( T = 32 \).
   - From the jogger jeans: \( J - 22 = 2 \) implies \( J = 24 \).

6. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \).

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 more than the tattered jeans.

"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( C \).

Kenny keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards. The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3}C \).

Each card is sold for $1.5, so the total amount of money he makes from selling the cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}C \).

Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 left for spending cash, so the total amount of money he makes from selling the cards is $150.

We can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}C = 150 \]

Simplify the left side:
\[ 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}C = 1 \times C = C \]

So, we have:
\[ C = 150 \]

Thus, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - Therefore, he prepared 18 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 36 hotdogs for the second hotdogs.
   - Additionally, he prepared 36 - 18 = 18 hotdogs for the remaining guests who would have one hotdog each.
   - Total hotdogs prepared = 36 (for second hotdogs) + 18 (for one hotdog each) = 54 hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Total hotdogs needed = 40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only had 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short = 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest wanted a second hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is equal to the number of hotdogs short.
   - Therefore, 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

Adding these together, the total cost before the discount is:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

"First, we need to convert the length of the room from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:
\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]

"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to Marcus baking. He bakes for 3 hours, and each hour the temperature increases by 5 degrees:

3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. After baking, the temperature is:

40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

Next, Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. The total cooling effect is:

30 minutes / 10 minutes/period * 2 degrees/period = 3 * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

Subtracting the cooling effect from the temperature after baking:

55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

The house's final temperature is 49 degrees.

"First, let's calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon:

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. Jon's swim time is 40 minutes, so James's swim time is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Jon's bike time is 80 minutes, so James's bike time is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( R \) be the time it took James to complete the run. The total time for James is:
\[ 36 + 85 + R \]

Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + R = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 36 + 85 + R = 180 \]
\[ 121 + R = 180 \]
\[ R = 180 - 121 \]
\[ R = 59 \]

So, it took James 59 minutes to complete the run.

"First, let's determine how far the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

1 hour = 60 minutes, so 30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours.

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 32 MPH × 0.5 hours = 16 miles

Next, we calculate the amount of hay the horse will eat for running 16 miles. The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile.

Hay needed = 16 miles × 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails

Now, we calculate the cost of 8 bails of hay. Each bail costs $3.

Cost of hay = 8 bails × $3/bail = $24

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, so he has:

Total money = 6 × $5 = $30

Finally, we calculate the change Michael will have after buying the hay.

Change = Total money - Cost of hay
Change = $30 - $24 = $6

"First, let's determine the value of the sapphires Jenna initially has:
- Jenna starts with 8 sapphires.
- Each sapphire is worth $800.
- Therefore, the total value of the sapphires is \( 8 \times 800 = 6400 \) dollars.

Next, Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies:
- The value of 3 sapphires is \( 3 \times 800 = 2400 \) dollars.
- Each ruby is worth $1200, so the value of 2 rubies is \( 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \) dollars.

"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed:
\[ V = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
\[ \text{Total volume} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed. Finally, we will divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips required.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each 1 pound.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each 12 pounds.
   - Total weight of carrots = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each 75 pounds.
   - Total weight of hay = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each 65 pounds.
   - Total weight of oats = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Next, we sum the weights of all the feed:
- Total weight of all feed = 2 (sugar cubes) + 48 (carrots) + 3150 (hay) + 1300 (oats) = 4500 pounds.

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips required:

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set up the equation:
\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):

- \( A \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( B \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |B| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

We need to find the number of kids who are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both, which is \( |A \cup B| \).

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[
|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
|A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12
\]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids who are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both from the total number of kids in the class:
\[
\text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - |A \cup B| = 32 - 12 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[
20

"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for one horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, one horse consumes \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for all four horses:**
   - There are 4 horses.
   - Therefore, the total daily consumption for all horses is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Calculate the total oats consumption for five days:**
   - The total consumption for 5 days is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Determine the number of 50-pound bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - The number of bags required is \(\frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the razors before applying the coupon. Since the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, Heather only needs to pay for one pack to get two packs.

The cost of one pack is $4.00. Therefore, the cost for two packs (with the buy one get one free offer) is:
\[ 4.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the $2.00 coupon to the total cost:
\[ 4.00 - 2.00 = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Heather is buying 2 packs, and each pack contains 4 razors, so she is getting:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ razors} \]

The cost per razor is:
\[ \frac{2.00 \text{ dollars}}{8 \text{ razors}} = 0.25 \text{ dollars per razor} \]

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let \( n \) be the number of guests.

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Cost of food per guest: $5
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5n \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest (including food): $25
- Total cost: \( 25n \)

We need to find the value of \( n \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

To solve for \( n \), we first isolate \( n \) on one side of the equation:
\[ 200 = 25n - 5n \]
\[ 200 = 20n \]

"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \), by Lily as \( L \), and by Bodhi as \( B \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Together they collected 43 insects: \( L + D + B = 43 \).
2. Lily found 7 more than David: \( L = D + 7 \).
3. David found half of what Bodhi found: \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \).

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \):
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, substitute \( D = 9 \) back into the equations for \( L \) and \( B \):

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting \( H = 3L \) into the equation \( H + L = 120,000 \), we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, substituting \( L = 30,000 \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the cost of the house is:
\[ 90,000 \]"

"First, let's determine how long it takes one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house.

Next, we need to convert the days into hours. Assuming a standard workday of 8 hours, 10 days is equivalent to:
\[ 10 \text{ days} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 80 \text{ hours} \]

Now, if 5 people are working together, the total time required to paint the house can be found by dividing the total hours by the number of people:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ hours}}{5 \text{ people}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

"Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as \( C_O \) and the number of sofas Ophelia has as \( S_O \). According to the problem, Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( S_O = 20 \).

Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can write:
\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]
Substituting \( S_O = 20 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so the number of chairs Jenna has, \( C_J \), is:
\[ C_J = 3 \times C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so the number of sofas Jenna has, \( S_J \), is:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together. The total number of sofas is:
\[ S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \]

The total number of chairs is:
\[ C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \]

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we can break down the information given:

1. Josh worked out for 4 hours each week for most of the weeks.
2. There were two consecutive weeks where he worked out for 5 hours each week.
3. There was one week where he worked out for 6 hours.

First, calculate the total hours for the weeks he worked out 4 hours:
- There are 8 weeks in total.
- He worked out 5 hours for 2 weeks and 6 hours for 1 week, which totals 3 weeks.
- Therefore, the number of weeks he worked out 4 hours is \(8 - 3 = 5\) weeks.
- The total hours for these 5 weeks is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) hours.

Next, calculate the total hours for the weeks he worked out 5 hours:
- He worked out 5 hours for 2 weeks.
- The total hours for these 2 weeks is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.

Finally, calculate the total hours for the week he worked out 6 hours:
- He worked out 6 hours for 1 week.
- The total hours for this week is \(1 \times 6 = 6\) hours.

Now, add all these totals together to find the total number of hours he spent working out over the 8 weeks:
- Total hours = \(20 + 10 + 6 = 36\) hours.

Thus, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. Each person calls 3 other families, and this process repeats in each round.

1. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
2. In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) families are called.
3. In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so \(9 \times 3 = 27\) families are called.
4. In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so \(27 \times 3 = 81\) families are called.

Thus, the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls is 81.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Cost of notebooks: 5 notebooks * $1.50/notebook = $7.50
- Cost of pens: 2 pens * $0.25/pen = $0.50
- Cost of calculator: 1 calculator * $12/calculator = $12.00
- Cost of geometry set: 1 geometry set * $10/geometry set = $10.00

Now, add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
$7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

Next, calculate the 10% discount on the total cost:
10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to spend:
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. 

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Therefore, when the water is warm, he swims a mile in:
\[ 2 \times 16 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water.

- Cold water: \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \)
- Warm water: \( 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \)

Now, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

"To find the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag, we can break the problem into two parts:

1. Calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes.
2. Calculate the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

First, we know there are 7 buttons with two holes each:
7 buttons * 2 holes/button = 14 holes

Next, we need to find out how many buttons have four holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have two holes, the remaining buttons are:
21 buttons - 7 buttons = 14 buttons

These 14 buttons each have four holes:
14 buttons * 4 holes/button = 56 holes

Now, we add the holes from both types of buttons:
14 holes + 56 holes = 70 holes

Therefore, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle from the ground to the sun after it has moved for 10 hours.

1. **Initial Angle**: The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.

2. **Sun's Movement**: The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour straight upward from the pyramid. Over 10 hours, the sun will move:
   \[
   5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Final Angle**: The final angle from the ground to the sun is the sum of the initial angle and the angle the sun has moved:

"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the 100 pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \(15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes}\).

Next, we convert the total reading time into pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is \(\frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute}\).

Now, we calculate the total number of pages read in the first week:
- Total pages in the first week = \(105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages}\).

Finally, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Shiloh's current age \( S = 44 \).
2. In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \).
3. In 7 years, his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substitute \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

   \[
   \text{Richie's goals} = \text{Mark's goals} + 20
   \]
   Substituting the value of Richie's goals:
   \[
   80 = \text{Mark's goals} + 20
   \]
   Solving for Mark's goals:
   \[
   \text{Mark's goals} = 80 - 20 = 60
   \]

3. **Anna's Goals:**
   Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Richie's goals} = \text{Anna's goals} + 45

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
2. Calculate the total number of roses the flower shops order in a month.
3. Determine the difference between the total number of roses ordered and the total number of roses grown.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month. Assuming a month has 4 weeks:
\[ 40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 160 \text{ roses/month} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of roses the flower shops order in a month. The first shop orders 20 roses, the second shop orders 15 roses, and the third shop orders 30 roses per week. So, the total number of roses ordered per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses/week} \]

Now, for a month (4 weeks):
\[ 65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 260 \text{ roses/month} \]

Finally, we determine how many roses Ford lacks by subtracting the total number of roses he grows from the total number of roses ordered:
\[ 260 \text{ roses/month} - 160 \text{ roses/month} = 100 \text{ roses/month} \]

So, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

Next, subtract this amount from Herb's house value to find Juan's house value:
$76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, add the values of both houses to find the combined value:
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

"First, let's determine how many cups and dishes Judy bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so:
\[ \text{Number of dishes Judy bought} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Next, we know Judy's friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy:
\[ \text{Number of dishes Judy's friend brought} = 24 + 20 = 44 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend:
\[ \text{Total cups} = 12 + 40 = 52 \]
\[ \text{Total dishes} = 24 + 44 = 68 \]

Finally, the total number of utensils is:
\[ \text{Total utensils} = 52 + 68 = 120 \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of 2 boxes of contacts with the 10% discount. 

The original price of one box is $100.00. With a 10% discount, the price of one box is:
\[ 100.00 - (100.00 \times 0.10) = 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

So, the cost for 2 boxes is:
\[ 2 \times 90.00 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of contacts Pete gets from 2 boxes:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Since Pete uses 2 contacts per day, the total number of pairs of contacts is:
\[ 180 \div 2 = 90 \]

Finally, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \) and the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining the terms on the left side:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- Number of red jelly beans: \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans: \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Thus, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options, we need to calculate the total weight change for each option and then find the difference between these totals.

1. **Weight loss with Cheerios:**
   - Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
   - Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is \( 1.25 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 6.25 \, \text{pounds} \).

2. **Weight gain with donuts:**
   - Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
   - Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is \( 1.75 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 8.75 \, \text{pounds} \).

3. **Difference in weight:**
   - The difference in weight between the two options is the sum of the weight loss and the weight gain, since one is a loss and the other is a gain.
   - Difference = \( 8.75 \, \text{pounds} + 6.25 \, \text{pounds} = 15 \, \text{pounds} \).

Thus, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 15 pounds.

"To determine how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work and then figure out how much more he needs to pay after his deposit.

1. Calculate the total cost of the dental work:
   - Each implant costs $2000.
   - He needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is \(2 \times 2000 = 4000\) dollars.
   - One of the implants requires a porcelain crown, which costs an additional $500.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \(4000 + 500 = 4500\) dollars.

2. Subtract the deposit George has already paid:
   - George has already paid a deposit of $600.
   - The remaining amount he needs to pay is \(4500 - 600 = 3900\) dollars.

3. Determine how many hours George needs to work to earn the remaining amount:
   - George earns $15 per hour.
   - The number of hours he needs to work is \(3900 \div 15 = 260\) hours.

Thus, George needs to work 260 hours to pay for the dental work.

"First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Colby has in cents. 

- Quarters: 8 quarters * 25 cents/quarter = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels * 5 cents/nickel = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies * 1 cent/penny = 15 cents

Now, we add all these amounts together to find the total amount of money Colby has:

200 cents (from quarters) + 60 cents (from dimes) + 70 cents (from nickels) + 15 cents (from pennies) = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one month.
2. Determine the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach the maximum number of rotations before they need to be replaced.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations in one month.**

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. We know that every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. 

First, find the number of 2-mile segments in 400 miles:
\[ \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/segment}} = 200 \text{ segments} \]

Next, calculate the total number of rotations in one month:
\[ 200 \text{ segments} \times 725 \text{ rotations/segment} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations in one year.**

There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach the maximum number of rotations.**

Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before it needs to be replaced. To find the number of years:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Thus, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we first need to find the total number of washes Jackie can get from the bottle if she uses 1 pump per wash. 

1. The bottle provides 120 washes when using 2 pumps per wash.
2. If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the number of washes will double:
   \[
   120 \text{ washes} \times 2 = 240 \text{ washes}
   \]

Next, we calculate the cost per wash when using 1 pump per wash.

3. The total cost of the bottle is $24.00.
4. The cost per wash is:
   \[
   \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{240 \text{ washes}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per wash}
   \]

Since the question asks for the cost per pump in cents, we convert dollars to cents:

5. 0.10 dollars is equivalent to:
   \[
   0.10 \times 100 = 10 \text{ cents}
   \]

Thus, the cost per pump is:
\[
10 \text{ cents}

"First, let's calculate the total original price of the items Joe wants to buy:
- The shirt costs $25.
- The shorts cost $35.
- Total original price = $25 + $35 = $60.

Next, we calculate the discount:
- The discount is 30% off, so the discount amount = 30% of $60 = 0.30 * $60 = $18.

Now, we find the total price after the discount:
- Total price after discount = $60 - $18 = $42.

Joe has $50 to spend. We subtract the total price after discount from the amount Joe has:
- Money left = $50 - $42 = $8.

Therefore, Joe will have $8 left after the purchase.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of John's research, which includes the initial funding and the additional funding required for the extended period.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Extended Research Period:**
   - The research takes 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so the total research period is \(5 \times 10 = 50\) months.
   - The first 5 months are already covered by the initial funding, so the extended period is \(50 - 5 = 45\) months.

3. **Funding for Extended Period:**
   - Each month after the first 5 months requires 50% more funding than the initial monthly funding.
   - The initial monthly funding is \(\frac{100,000}{5} = 20,000\) dollars per month.
   - The increased monthly funding is \(20,000 \times 1.5 = 30,000\) dollars per month.

4. **Total Cost for Extended Period:**
   - The total cost for the extended 45 months is \(45 \times 30,000 = 1,350,000\) dollars.

5. **Total Research Cost:**
   - The total cost of the research is the sum of the initial funding and the extended period funding.
   - Total cost = Initial funding + Extended period funding
   - Total cost = \(100,000 + 1,350,000 = 1,450,000\) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is \(1,450,000\).

"To find out how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sales amount.
2. Determine the cost of acquiring the cars.
3. Calculate the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission on the profit.

Step 1: Calculate the total sales amount.
James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
Total sales = 10 * $25,000 = $250,000

Step 2: Determine the cost of acquiring the cars.
The company paid 30% of the car's price to acquire them.

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between them. 

First, we find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, and Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. 

Next, we need to find out how long it will take Tom to close the 75-mile gap at this rate. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if he misses some classes. The total cost of the classes is $60, and there are 10 classes in total.

1. Calculate the cost per class if Manny attends all 10 classes:
   \[
   \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class}
   \]

2. Determine the maximum cost per class that Manny's parents are willing to pay:
   \[
   \text{Maximum cost per class} = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. If he misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class he attends will then be:
   \[
   \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x}
   \]

4. Set up the inequality to find the maximum number of classes he can miss:
   \[
   \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
   \]

5. Solve the inequality:
   \[
   60 \leq 10(10 - x)
   \]
   \[
   60 \leq 100 - 10x
   \]
   \[
   10x \leq 40

"First, we determine the number of likes Fishio received three weeks after the initial week. The problem states that the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. The initial number of likes was 2000.

\[ 70 \times 2000 = 140000 \]

This means that after four weeks, Fishio had 140000 likes. Recently, she received an additional 20000 likes. We add these to the 140000 likes to find the total number of likes.

\[ 140000 + 20000 = 160000 \]

Thus, the total number of Instagram likes Fishio has is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost Clara paid for the pomegranates on Tuesday.

1. Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each:
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
2. She had a voucher for $2 off:
   \[
   400 - 2 = 398
   \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid for the pomegranates on Wednesday.

1. Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each:
   \[
   20 \times 30 = 600
   \]
2. The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost:
   \[
   10\% \text{ of } 600 = 0.10 \times 600 = 60
   \]
3. The total cost after the discount:
   \[
   600 - 60 = 540
   \]

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[
540 - 398 = 142
\]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[
142

"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total sales from green hats in the first month.
2. Calculate the total sales for the first month.
3. Calculate the total sales for the second month.
4. Sum the total sales for both months.

**Step 1: Determine the total sales from green hats in the first month.**

Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Therefore, the sales from green hats can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Sales from green hats} = 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total sales for the first month.**

The total sales for the first month are the sum of the sales from red hats and green hats:
\[ \text{Total sales for the first month} = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total sales for the second month.**

In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month:
\[ \text{Total sales for the second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

**Step 4: Sum the total sales for both months.**

The total sales for both months are:
\[ \text{Total sales for both months} = 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Thus, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is:
\[ 2100 \]"
"To determine how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, we need to break down the costs based on the given conditions.

1. **Total Time Used:**
   - James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:
   Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests.
   \[
   3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} \times 16 \text{ guests} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves}
   \]

2. Determine the number of whole eggs required:
   Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many whole eggs are needed to make 48 deviled egg halves.
   \[
   \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs}
   \]

3. Convert the number of whole eggs to dozens:
   There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozens}
   \]

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day.

First, we calculate the total number of days required to read the book:
\[ \text{Total pages} = 200 \]
\[ \text{Pages per day} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Total days required} = \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Next, we determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish:
\[ \text{Deadline} = 30 \text{ days} \]
\[ \text{Days before deadline} = 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days} \]

Thus, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

"To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for the hanger and fuel over 12 months.

1. **Initial cost of the plane:**
   \[
   \text{Initial cost} = \$150,000
   \]

2. **Monthly cost to rent a hanger:**
   \[
   \text{Hanger cost per month} = \$5,000
   \]

3. **Monthly cost for fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Fuel cost per month} = 2 \times \text{Hanger cost per month} = 2 \times \$5,000 = \$10,000
   \]

4. **Total monthly maintenance cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total monthly cost} = \text{Hanger cost per month} + \text{Fuel cost per month} = \$5,000 + \$10,000 = \$15,000
   \]

5. **Total maintenance cost for the first year:**
   \[
   \text{Total maintenance cost for 12 months} = 12 \times \text{Total monthly cost} = 12 \times \$15,000 = \$180,000
   \]

6. **Total cost for the first year:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Initial cost} + \text{Total maintenance cost for 12 months} = \$150,000 + \$180,000 = \$330,000

"To solve the problem, let's break down the information given:

1. The time it took to cook rice is 30 minutes.
2. The time it took to cook pork is 20 minutes more than the time it took to cook rice.
3. The time it took to cook beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.

Let's denote:
- The time to cook rice as \( R \) = 30 minutes.
- The time to cook pork as \( P \).
- The time to cook beans as \( B \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ P = R + 20 \]
\[ P = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

The combined cooking time of pork and rice is:
\[ R + P = 30 + 50 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

The time to cook beans is half of this combined time:
\[ B = \frac{R + P}{2} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find the total cooking time for all the food:
\[ \text{Total time} = R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it took to cook all the food is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let \( s \) represent the number of sheep and \( g \) represent the number of geese.

1. Each animal has one head, so the total number of heads is:
   \[
   s + g = 20
   \]

2. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, so the total number of legs is:
   \[
   4s + 2g = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   \[
   2s + g = 35
   \]

Now we have the system of equations:
   \[
   s + g = 20
   \]
   \[
   2s + g = 35
   \]

To eliminate \( g \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
   \[
   (2s + g) - (s + g) = 35 - 20
   \]
   \[
   2s + g - s - g = 15
   \]
   \[
   s = 15
   \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( s = 15 \).

- Let \( A \) represent the amount of money Aurelia has.
- Let \( K \) represent the amount of money Kassidy has.
- Let \( R \) represent the amount of money Rayna has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Aurelia has $120, so \( A = 120 \).
2. Kassidy has \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as much money as Aurelia, so \( K = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \).
3. Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so \( R = K + 60 \).

First, calculate Kassidy's amount of money:
\[ K = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, calculate Rayna's amount of money:
\[ R = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we need to find the total amount of money they have together:
\[ \text{Total} = A + K + R = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

If they decide to share the total amount equally among the three of them, each person would get:

2. **Good Days in the First 30 Days**: 12 days.
3. **Bad Days in the First 30 Days**: 8 days.
4. **Neutral Days in the First 30 Days**: The rest of the days, which is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

Next, we need to consider the distribution of these days over the first 24 days:
- **First 8 Days**: All good.
- **Next 8 Days**: All bad.
- **Next 8 Days**: All neutral.

Now, we need to account for the next three days:
- The next three days are good, neutral, and good.

So, let's update the count of good days:
- Initially, there were 12 good days.
- The next three days add 2 more good days (one good day and another good day).

Thus, the total number of good days after the next three days is:
\[ 12 + 2 = 14 \]

Since the month has 30 days, and we have already accounted for 27 days (24 initial days + 3 next days), we need to determine how many good days are left in the remaining 3 days of the month.

The remaining 3 days of the month are:
- Day 28: Good

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. James buys toys for these 12 dogs, so he buys 12 toys.
4. After buying the toys, he finds that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Initially, there were 12 dogs, so now there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
5. James needs to buy toys for these additional 12 dogs (24 - 12 = 12 more dogs), so he buys 12 more toys.
6. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs toys for these 3 dogs. The number of dogs now is 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.
7. James needs to have 21 toys in total for the 21 dogs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of toys James needs:
- Initially, he had 4 toys.
- He bought 12 toys for the first 12 dogs.
- He bought 12 more toys for the additional 12 dogs.
- He no longer needs 3 toys because 3 dogs are gone.

"Let's denote the number of cookies each person has as follows:
- \( K \) for Katarina
- \( M \) for Max
- \( C \) for Cookie Monster
- \( S \) for Summer

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max: \( K = M - 5 \)
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster: \( M = C + 12 \)
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max: \( S = M + 23 \)
4. Katarina has 68 cookies: \( K = 68 \)

First, we substitute \( K = 68 \) into the first equation:
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]
Solving for \( M \):
\[ M = 68 + 5 = 73 \]

Next, we substitute \( M = 73 \) into the second equation:
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = 73 - 12 = 61 \]

Then, we substitute \( M = 73 \) into the third equation:
\[ S = 73 + 23 = 96 \]

Now, we have the number of cookies each person has:
- Katarina: \( K = 68 \)
- Max: \( M = 73 \)

"Let the original length of the dress be \( L \) cm.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the extension is \( 0.5L \) cm.

She also adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom of the dress.

The final length of the dress is the sum of the original length, the extension, and the lace trim:
\[ L + 0.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( L \):
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ L = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Chris spent mowing each half of his lawn in the different modes and then sum these times.

1. **Turtle mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes).
   - Therefore, to mow half the lawn, he would take half of 60 minutes.
   - Time in turtle mode = 60 / 2 = 30 minutes.

2. **Rabbit mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes.
   - Therefore, to mow half the lawn, he would take half of 40 minutes.
   - Time in rabbit mode = 40 / 2 = 20 minutes.

3. **Total time:**
   - Total time = Time in turtle mode + Time in rabbit mode
   - Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

"To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to calculate the total time they have already spent walking and subtract that from the total time they have available.

1. Total time available to walk to school: 30 minutes
2. Time taken to get to the corner where the library is: 6 minutes
3. Time taken to get to the fire station from the library: 13 minutes

First, add the time taken to get to the library and the time taken to get to the fire station:
6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Next, subtract the total time spent walking so far from the total time available:
30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late.

"Let's denote the age of one of the triplets as \( t \). Since one of the twins is 7 years older than one of the triplets, the age of one of the twins is \( t + 7 \).

There are three triplets and two twins, so the combined age of all the children is:
\[ 3t + 2(t + 7) = 44 \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:
\[ 3t + 2t + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5t + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5t = 30 \]
\[ t = 6 \]

The age of one of the triplets is 6 years. Therefore, the age of one of the twins is:
\[ t + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13 \]

"First, we need to determine the cost of each candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40.

The total cost of the lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

So, the total cost of the candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Since he bought four candies, the cost of each candy is:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over a period of ten years.

First, let's determine how many coins Neil saves each month. Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. 

The additional amount Neil saves each month is:
\[ 20 \times \frac{2}{5} = 8 \text{ coins} \]

So, Neil saves:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins saved by each person over ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Finally, we add the total savings of Rong and Neil to find the combined total:
\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

Thus, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:
\[ 5760 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Let \( x \) be the total bill. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill:
\[ 0.60x \]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ x = 40 + 0.60x \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x - 0.60x = 40 \]
\[ 0.40x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Cost of apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Cost of oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as one banana.
   - One banana costs $1, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

4. **Total cost of the crate:**
   - Sum the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges: \(5 + 6 + 21 = 32\) dollars.

"To find the total number of squares on Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares**: The problem states there are 14 red squares.
   \[
   \text{Red squares} = 14
   \]

2. **Blue Squares**: The problem states there are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   \[
   \text{Blue squares} = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]

3. **Green Squares**: The problem states there are 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   \[
   \text{Green squares} = 18 + 6 = 24
   \]

4. **White Squares**: The problem states there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   \[
   \text{White squares} = 24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
\[
\text{Total squares} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68
\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter in square feet is:
\[
\text{Total area} = 68 \text{ square feet}

"First, let's determine the total number of chairs needed for the function. There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of chairs required is:

\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]

Next, we need to find out how many chairs Mia's restaurant currently has. The restaurant has 8 high chairs and 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Therefore, the number of regular chairs is:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

So, the total number of chairs currently available in the restaurant is:

\[ 8 + 40 = 48 \]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs she currently has from the total number of chairs required:

\[ 57 - 48 = 9 \]

Therefore, Mia needs to get 9 more chairs.

"First, let's determine the number of points each student has collected.

1. Adam has collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
   - 30% of 50 points is \( 0.30 \times 50 = 15 \) points.
   - Therefore, Betty has \( 50 + 15 = 65 \) points.
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   - Therefore, Tom has \( 65 - 30 = 35 \) points.
4. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   - Therefore, Martha has \( 3 \times 35 = 105 \) points.

Next, we sum the points collected by all the students:
- Adam: 50 points
- Betty: 65 points
- Tom: 35 points
- Martha: 105 points

Total points collected by the class:
\[ 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 \]

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing:

"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:
\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat, and each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks. Therefore, for 20 seats, the total number of drinks and snacks is:
\[ 20 \text{ seats} \times 2 \text{ drinks/seat} = 40 \text{ drinks} \]
\[ 20 \text{ seats} \times 3 \text{ snacks/seat} = 60 \text{ snacks} \]

The total number of drinks and snacks combined is:
\[ 40 \text{ drinks} + 60 \text{ snacks} = 100 \text{ items} \]

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost is:

"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy with $6.00, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, calculate how many scoops Erin can buy without the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

However, with the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 additional scoop free. Let's see how many sets of 2 scoops she can buy with $6.00:
\[ \frac{6.00}{(1.50 \times 2)} = \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Each set of 2 scoops gives her 1 free scoop, so:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops per set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with her $6.00.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Gunther initially had 48 bananas.
2. Arnold stole half of the bananas:
   \[
   \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   So, Gunther had:
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24 \text{ bananas left}
   \]

3. The next day, Gunther added 25 bananas:
   \[
   24 + 25 = 49 \text{ bananas}
   \]

4. Later that evening, Arnold stole 12 bananas:
   \[
   49 - 12 = 37 \text{ bananas}
   \]

5. On the third day, Gunther added 6 more bananas:
   \[
   37 + 6 = 43 \text{ bananas}
   \]

So, the final number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is:
\[

"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the monthly cost per roommate.
2. Multiply the monthly cost per roommate by the number of months in a year.

The total monthly electricity bill is $100. Since there are 4 roommates, the monthly cost per roommate is:
\[ \frac{100}{4} = 25 \]

Next, we calculate the annual cost per roommate by multiplying the monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ 25 \times 12 = 300 \]

So, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity.

"First, we need to calculate the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent for the party. 

- Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 8 dozen glasses equal \(8 \times 12 = 96\) glasses.
- Jeff also sent 4 dozen plates. Similarly, 4 dozen plates equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) plates.

Next, we account for the broken items:

- 10 glasses were broken, so the remaining number of glasses is \(96 - 10 = 86\).
- 6 plates were broken, so the remaining number of plates is \(48 - 6 = 42\).

Therefore, the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now is \(86 + 42 = 128\).

"First, let's calculate how many small stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons. She starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them:
\[ 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \text{ small stickers} \]

Each small sticker is worth one small button, so she gets 27 small buttons from this trade.

Next, we calculate how many large stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons. She starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them:
\[ 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \text{ large stickers} \]

Each large sticker is worth one large button, so she gets 20 large buttons from this trade.

Now, we need to determine how many large stickers she has left after trading 50% of them:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ large stickers} \]

She trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons. Each large sticker is worth three small buttons:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ small buttons} \]

Now, we sum up all the buttons Lorraine has:
- Small buttons from trading small stickers: 27
- Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60
- Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20

Total small buttons:
\[ 27 + 60 = 87 \]

Total large buttons:
\[ 20 \]

Total buttons:
\[ 87 + 20 = 107 \]

Thus, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is:

"Let's denote the number of votes in favor of the new regulation as \( F \) and the number of votes against it as \( A \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, which can be expressed as:
\[ F = 2A \]

The total number of people on the council is 33, so the total number of votes is also 33. This can be expressed as:
\[ F + A = 33 \]

We can substitute \( F = 2A \) into the second equation:
\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now, substituting \( A = 11 \) back into the equation \( F = 2A \):
\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To find out how many shirts Krissa needs to order, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small (S) shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.
   - Number of small shirts = 2 * 11 = 22

3. **Medium (M) shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of medium shirts = 22 - 4 = 18

4. **Large (L) shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of large shirts = 18 / 2 = 9

5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of extra-large shirts = 9 + 6 = 15

Now, we add up all the shirts:
- XS: 11

"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

1. Let's denote the total number of Jana's puppies as \( P \).
2. According to the problem, two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Therefore, the number of Pomeranians is \( \frac{2}{3}P \).
3. One third of the Pomeranians are girls. Therefore, the number of Pomeranian girls is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the Pomeranians, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{2}{3}P = \frac{2}{9}P \).
4. We are given that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{9}P = 6

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 250 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so:

"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish Bob bought as \( W \).

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying 17 more fish, the total number of fish he had was:
\[ 3 + O \text{ (orange fish)} \]
\[ 4 + W \text{ (white fish)} \]

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish:
\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

We also know that the total number of fish bought is 17:
\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

First, simplify the first equation:
\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

Now we have:
1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From the second equation, solve for \( O \):
\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute \( O = 17 - W \) into the first equation:
\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]
\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]
\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3W = -12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. 

To verify, substitute \( W = 4 \) back into the equation \( O + W = 17 \):
\[ O + 4 = 17 \]
\[ O = 13 \]

Now check the condition \( 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \):
\[ 3 + 13 = 2(4 + 4) \]
\[ 16 = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ 16 = 16 \]

The condition is satisfied. Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

"To find out how many OLED TVs Samwell's store sold, we first need to determine the fraction of the total sales that are OLED TVs. 

1. Calculate the fraction of sales that are smart TVs and analog TVs:
   - Smart TVs: \( \frac{1}{4} \)
   - Analog TVs: \( \frac{1}{8} \)

2. Add these fractions to find the total fraction of sales that are not OLED TVs:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{8}
   \]

3. Subtract this fraction from 1 to find the fraction of sales that are OLED TVs:
   \[
   1 - \frac{3}{8} = \frac{8}{8} - \frac{3}{8} = \frac{5}{8}
   \]

4. Calculate the number of OLED TVs sold by multiplying the total number of TVs by the fraction of OLED TVs:
   \[
   40 \times \frac{5}{8} = 40 \times 0.625 = 25

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has.

Bubbles has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

The total number of stuffed animals she currently has is:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be:
\[ 14 + x \]

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so the amount of salt is \( 2z \) ounces. Since the amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, the amount of sugar is also \( 2z \) ounces.

The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2 \times 2z = 4z \) ounces.

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]

"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount raised by the students. The total amount raised for the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Since there are 20 students, and they each raised the same amount, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ 125,000 \div 20 = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250.

"To find the total time Sandy took to walk over the two days in minutes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the time Sandy walked on the second day.
2. Add the time from both days.
3. Convert the total time from hours to minutes.

First, we know that Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day:
\[ \text{Time on the second day} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we add the time from both days:
\[ \text{Total time in hours} = 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we convert the total time from hours to minutes:
\[ \text{Total time in minutes} = 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[ 720 \]"

"To find out how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tasks John completes in one day.
2. Calculate the total number of tasks John completes in one week.
3. Calculate the total earnings for the week.

Step 1: Total tasks per day
- John does 30 cycles a day.
- Each cycle has 5 tasks.
- Total tasks per day = 30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Step 2: Total tasks per week
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Total tasks per week = 150 tasks/day * 7 days/week = 1050 tasks/week

Step 3: Total earnings per week
- Each task pays $1.20.
- Total earnings per week = 1050 tasks/week * $1.20/task = $1260

Therefore, John makes $1260 in a full 7-day week.

"To find out how many total points Sasha scored during both games, we need to break down the information given:

1. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.
3. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

Now, we add the points Sasha scored in both games:
- First game: 14 points
- Second game: 4 points

Total points scored by Sasha: \(14 + 4 = 18\)

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Thus, Becca has 153 cards.

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Anthony has.
2. Calculate how much more Roy has saved compared to Anthony.
3. Add the additional amount Roy saved to Anthony's total to find Roy's total savings.

First, we know that Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so:
\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Next, Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings:
\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]

Therefore, Roy's total savings are:
\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 12 = 30 + 12 = 42 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the height Naruto can lift a mountain, given the relationships between the heights each person can lift and the base height that Pompei can lift.

1. **Determine the height Saskay can lift a mountain:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \( 12 \times 1 = 12 \) inches.

2. **Determine the height Kagiyami can lift a mountain:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) inches.

3. **Determine the height Naruto can lift a mountain:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \( 10 \times 48 = 480 \) inches.

4. **Convert the height from inches to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then use that to find out how long it will take the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the distance across the highway be \( D \) miles.
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( v \) miles per hour.
   - Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance \( D \), the total distance traveled by the 3 kangaroos is \( 3 \times v \times 18 \) miles.
   - Therefore, \( 3 \times v \times 18 = D \).
   - Simplifying, we get \( 54v = D \).
   - So, the speed of one kangaroo is \( v = \frac{D}{54} \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.
   - Therefore, the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} = \frac{D}{108} \) miles per hour.

3. **Determine the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is \( 4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27} \) miles per hour.
   - The time \( t \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by the formula \( t = \frac{D}{\text{speed}} \).
   - Substituting the speed of the 4 turtles, we get \( t = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \) hours.

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

1. Kora made 20 dishes, so \( K = 20 \).
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so \( R = K + 20 \).
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so \( J = 2R \).

First, calculate the number of dishes Rory made:
\[ R = K + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Next, calculate the number of dishes Jada made:
\[ J = 2R = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Now, sum the number of dishes made by all three:
\[ J + R + K = 80 + 40 + 20 = 140 \]

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is:

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after all contributions and then subtract the cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in reduces the price by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( P \).

The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her part-time job earnings, and the money from her mom:
\[ P + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the reduced price of the laptop:
\[ P + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ P + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( P \):
\[ P = 350 - 230 \]
\[ P = 120 \]

"To find out how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first calculate the total amount of milk produced by the current cows:

- Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day.
- The farmer has 3 cows, so the total milk produced is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) liters a day.

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters a day. The additional amount of milk needed is \(25 - 15 = 10\) liters a day.

Since each cow produces 5 liters a day, the number of additional cows needed is \(10 \div 5 = 2\).

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( S_J \) be the number of socks Jack has.
- Let \( D_J \) be the number of dishes Jack has.
- Let \( S_P \) be the number of socks Peter has.
- Let \( D_P \) be the number of dishes Peter has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Jack collected 60 dishes: \( D_J = 60 \).
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks: \( D_J = 2 \times S_J \).

Using the second piece of information:
\[ 60 = 2 \times S_J \]
\[ S_J = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Next, we know:
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack: \( S_P = 2 \times S_J \).
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack: \( D_P = \frac{1}{2} \times D_J \).

Using these relationships:
\[ S_P = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]
\[ D_P = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
\[ \text{Total socks} = S_J + S_P = 30 + 60 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Total dishes} = D_J + D_P = 60 + 30 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Total items} = \text{Total socks} + \text{Total dishes} = 90 + 90 = 180 \]

"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

1. We know that 5 students are good at math only.
2. We also know that 8 students perform well in English only.
3. The total number of students in the class is 20.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. We do this by subtracting the number of students who are good at math only and those who are good at English only from the total number of students:

\[ 20 - 5 - 8 = 7 \]

So, 7 students are good at both math and English.

Next, we add the number of students who are good at math only to the number of students who are good at both math and English to find the total number of students who are good at math:

\[ 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students who are good at math is 12.

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the principal amount.

1. **Identify the principal amount (P):**
   \[
   P = 300 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the interest rate (r):**
   The interest rate is given as three-quarters of the original amount per year. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   r = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total interest (I) over 3 years:**
   Simple interest is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   I = P \times r \times t
   \]
   where \( t \) is the time in years. Here, \( t = 3 \) years.
   \[
   I = 300 \times 225 \times 3
   \]
   \[
   I = 300 \times 675
   \]
   \[
   I = 202500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount (A) after 3 years:**
   The total amount is the sum of the principal and the interest:
   \[
   A = P + I
   \]
   \[
   A = 300 + 202500
   \]
   \[
   A = 202800 \text{ dollars}
   \]

However, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the interest rate. The interest rate should be a fraction of the principal, not a fixed amount. Let's correct this:

The correct interest rate should be:
\[
r = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \text{ (or 75% per year)}
\]

Now, calculate the interest correctly:
\[
I = P \times r \times t
\]
\[
I = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3
\]
\[
I = 300 \times 2.25
\]
\[
I = 675 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, calculate the total amount:
\[
A = P + I
\]
\[
A = 300 + 675
\]
\[
A = 975 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[
\boxed{975}

"First, let's determine how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm:

- From Farm X, he sold 10 goats.
- From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

Next, we calculate the number of goats remaining in each farm:

- Initially, Farm X had 55 goats. After selling 10, the remaining number of goats is \(55 - 10 = 45\).
- Initially, Farm Y had 45 goats. After selling 20, the remaining number of goats is \(45 - 20 = 25\).

Finally, we add the remaining goats from both farms to find the total number of goats left:

- Total goats left = \(45 + 25 = 70\).

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- My age: \( x \)
- My brother's age: \( x + 3 \) (since I am three years younger than my brother)
- My sister's age: \( x - 2 \) (since I am two years older than my sister)
- My mom's age: \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \) (since my mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age)

According to the problem, the sum of all our ages is 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 9 - 1) = 87 \]
\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 13 \]

So, I am 13 years old.

"First, we calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we multiply 40 by 20:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips:

\[ 10\% \times 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

Subtract this amount from Rafaela's total to find Julieta's total:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

So, Julieta received $720 in tips.

To find the total amount of tips both received, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips together:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of tips Julieta and Rafaela received is:

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \), the number of books that Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books that Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Total number of books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now, substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Kelly is buying:

- The total cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10, so each pack of bacon costs $10 / 5 = $2.
- Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet of chicken costs $2 * 2 = $4.
- Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
- Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of item:

- The total cost for 6 packets of chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.
- The total cost for 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.
- The total cost for 7 packs of apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up all the costs:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the speed of a whirligig based on the given information about the speeds of a thingamabob and a whatchamacallit.

1. Let the speed of a thingamabob be \( T \) meters per second.
2. According to the problem, a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whatchamacallit is \( 11T \) meters per second.
3. We are given that the speed of a whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   11T = 121
   \]
4. Solving for \( T \):
   \[
   T = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
   \]
5. A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whirligig is:

"To find the cost of one carrot, let's break down the information given:

1. Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day.
2. The salad costs $6.
3. The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) dollars.
4. The total cost for all her food is $11.

Let \( c \) be the cost of one carrot. Since she eats two carrots, the cost for the carrots is \( 2c \).

The total cost equation is:
\[ 2c + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2c + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns and then subtract that from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

1. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed each lawn:**
   - Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

2. **Calculate the total number of times Tasha mowed lawns:**
   - Total times mowing lawns = \( J + 3J + 5J = 9J \).

3. **Determine the total amount Tasha earned from mowing lawns:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.
   - Since \( J \) is the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, and she earned $6 in total, we can assume \( J = 1 \) (since the problem doesn't specify otherwise, and $6 is a reasonable amount for one mowing job).

4. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - If \( J = 1 \), then Tasha mowed Joe's lawn 1 time, Kamala's lawn 3 times, and Alba's lawn 5 times.
   - Total times mowing lawns = \( 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 \) times.
   - If Joe paid $6 for 1 mowing, and assuming the rate is the same for all lawns, Tasha earned \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \) dollars from mowing lawns.

5. **Calculate the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales:**
   - Total earnings = $80.
   - Earnings from mowing lawns = $54.
   - Earnings from lemonade sales = \( 80 - 54 = 26 \).

Therefore, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we first need to calculate the amount of material required for each type of mask and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the material needed for small masks:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

2. **Calculate the material needed for large masks:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

3. **Sum the material needed for both types of masks:**
   - Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of cups**: Lana has 27 cups.
2. **Cups used for cinnamon tea**: She uses 15 cups for cinnamon tea.
3. **Cups left for chamomile and mint tea**: 
   \[
   27 - 15 = 12 \text{ cups}
   \]
4. **Cups in each row**: She divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, so each row has:
   \[
   \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups}
   \]
5. **Cups of chamomile and mint tea in each row**: Since the 12 remaining cups are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea, and these 12 cups are distributed across 3 rows, the number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ cups per row}
   \]
6. **Cups of mint tea in each row**: Since each row has an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups, the number of mint tea cups in each row is:

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Junebugs removed from Monday to Friday.
2. Divide the total by the number of days (5) to find the average.

First, let's calculate the total number of Junebugs removed each day:

- Monday: 39 Junebugs
- Tuesday: \( 2 \times 39 = 78 \) Junebugs
- Wednesday: \( 2 \times 39 = 78 \) Junebugs
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Now, sum these values to get the total number of Junebugs removed:

\[

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to account for the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up earlier than usual.

1. **Total sleep time without interruptions:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - 8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

2. **Time spent sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - Duration of sleepwalking = 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.

3. **Time she woke up earlier:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than 6 a.m.
   - Usual wake-up time: 6 a.m.
   - New wake-up time: 5:55 a.m.
   - Time lost due to waking up earlier = 5 minutes.

4. **Total sleep time on the bed:**
   - Total sleep time without interruptions: 480 minutes.
   - Subtract the time spent sleepwalking: 480 - 23 = 457 minutes.
   - Subtract the time lost due to waking up earlier: 457 - 5 = 452 minutes.

Therefore, the total number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is 452.

"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan initially has. We know that he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Since he has two dozen measuring cups, which is 24 cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Next, we need to account for the 6 measuring spoons that Jonathan gifts to Pedro. After gifting, the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. This includes both the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ \text{Total utensils} = 24 \text{ (measuring cups)} + 10 \text{ (measuring spoons)} = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day and there are 14 days in 2 weeks:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial occupied beds to the number of patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, we calculate the number of unoccupied beds by subtracting the total occupied beds from the hospital's total capacity:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total Emails**: Robyn sends 16 emails a day.
2. **Work Emails**: 7 of these are work emails.
3. **Remaining Emails**: Subtract the work emails from the total emails to find the remaining emails.
   \[
   16 - 7 = 9 \text{ emails}
   \]
4. **Family Emails**: Two-thirds of the remaining emails are to family.
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ emails}
   \]
5. **Other Emails**: Subtract the family emails from the remaining emails to find the other emails.
   \[
   9 - 6 = 3 \text{ emails}
   \]
6. **Emails to Boyfriend**: One-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend.
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \text{ email}
   \]

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"First, we determine Shawna's age based on Aliya's age. Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya and Aliya is 3 years old, we calculate:

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years

Next, we determine Shawna's father's age. Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we calculate:

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years

Thus, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

"If Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%, this means the actual number of people is 100% - 20% = 80% of what Courtney reported. Courtney reported 48 people, so we calculate 80% of 48 to find the actual number of attendees.

\[ \text{Actual number of attendees} = 48 \times 0.80 = 38.4 \]

Since the number of people must be a whole number, we round 38.4 to the nearest whole number, which is 38.

"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so:
\[ 2J = 2 \]
Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, we can find the number of balls each person carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey:
\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ 7 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Holes dug on the first day**: 10 holes.
2. **Holes dug on the second day**: 13 holes.
3. **Holes dug on the third day**: 8 holes, but 2 holes were filled in, so the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
\[ 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \text{ holes} \]

According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10, so:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes} \]

Let \( x \) be the number of holes dug on the fourth day. The total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
\[ 29 + x = 40 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 40 - 29 \]
\[ x = 11 \]

Thus, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Together they have caught 339 Pokemon:
   \[
   A + S + X = 339
   \]
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   X = S + 5
   \]
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught:
   \[
   S = 4A - 13
   \]

We can substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) into the first equation. First, substitute \( X = S + 5 \) into the total equation:
\[
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
\]
Simplify this equation:
\[
A + 2S + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
A + 2S = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \):
\[
A + 2(4A - 13) = 334
\]
Distribute the 2:
\[
A + 8A - 26 = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9A = 360
\]
Divide by 9:
\[
A = 40
\]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \) using \( S = 4A - 13 \):
\[
S = 4(40) - 13
\]
\[
S = 160 - 13
\]
\[
S = 147
\]

Thus, Stan has caught \(\boxed{147}\) Pokemon."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of episodes and then calculate the total time spent watching all episodes.

1. Each episode is 20 minutes long.
2. The number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. Therefore, the number of episodes is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

Now, we calculate the total time spent watching all episodes:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Number of episodes} \times \text{Length of each episode} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the bird traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

1. **Distance traveled south in the first leg:**
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Distance traveled north in the second leg:**
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Distance traveled south in the third leg:**
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances traveled south and subtract the distance traveled north:

- Total distance south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \)
- Total distance north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \)

Net distance traveled south:
- \( 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \)

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

"First, let's determine the total number of boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington initially had:
- She bought 12 boxes.

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave away:
- She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes.

Now, we find out how many boxes she has left after giving some away:
- 12 boxes - 4 boxes = 8 boxes.

Mrs. Harrington then kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges:
- 1/4 of 8 boxes = 2 boxes.

The number of boxes she sold is the remaining boxes after keeping 1/4:

"To determine how much Sunny earned over the two days, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold each day and then multiply by the respective prices.

First, let's define the number of boxes sold on each day:
- Let \( G_s \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday.
- Let \( A_s \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.
- Let \( G_u \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday.
- Let \( A_u \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday.

From the problem, we know:
- \( G_s = 10 \) (gingerbread sold on Saturday)
- \( A_s = G_s - 4 \) (apple pie sold on Saturday is 4 fewer than gingerbread sold on Saturday)
- \( G_u = G_s + 5 \) (gingerbread sold on Sunday is 5 more than gingerbread sold on Saturday)
- \( A_u = 15 \) (apple pie sold on Sunday)

Now, we can calculate the number of boxes sold on each day:
- \( A_s = 10 - 4 = 6 \)
- \( G_u = 10 + 5 = 15 \)
- \( A_u = 15 \)

Next, we calculate the total earnings for each day:
- Earnings from gingerbread on Saturday: \( 10 \times 6 = 60 \)
- Earnings from apple pie on Saturday: \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \)
- Earnings from gingerbread on Sunday: \( 15 \times 6 = 90 \)
- Earnings from apple pie on Sunday: \( 15 \times 15 = 225 \)

Finally, we sum up the total earnings for both days:
- Total earnings on Saturday: \( 60 + 90 = 150 \)
- Total earnings on Sunday: \( 90 + 225 = 315 \)
- Total earnings for two days: \( 150 + 315 = 465 \)

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers from inches to feet:**
   - Each flower is 12 inches wide.
   - 12 inches = 1 foot.

2. **Calculate the total space required for each plant including the space between them:**
   - Each plant requires 1 foot of space for the plant itself.
   - Each plant also requires 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - Total space per plant = 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - Number of plants that can fit = 111 feet / 2.5 feet per plant = 44.4.
   - Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 plants.
   - Number of additional plants needed = 44 plants - 17 plants = 27 plants.

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
12 pounds (sunflowers) + 15 pounds (carnations) = 27 pounds

The total amount of soil available is 30 pounds. Subtract the soil used for sunflowers and carnations from the total soil:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the tasks and calculate the time required for each.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Cooking the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To saute 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \text{Time to saute} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to peel and cook 90 shrimp is the sum of the time to peel and the time to saute:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes.

1. **Air conditioner on low for 3 hours:**
   - Cooling rate on low: 2 degrees per hour
   - Total cooling: \( 2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees} \)

2. **Air conditioner on high for 4 hours:**
   - Cooling rate on high: 3 degrees per hour
   - Total cooling: \( 3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees} \)

3. **Air conditioner off for 2 hours:**
   - Warming rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Total warming: \( 2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees} \)

4. **Net temperature change:**
   - Total cooling: \( 6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees} \)
   - Total warming: \( 4 \text{ degrees} \)

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet a second time, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Thus, the final answer is:

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the frequency of each type of check and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill checks:**
   - Buford writes 1 check per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, he writes \(1 \times 12 = 12\) checks for the electric bill per year.

2. **Gas bill checks:**
   - Buford writes 1 check per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, he writes \(1 \times 12 = 12\) checks for the gas bill per year.

3. **Church checks:**
   - Buford writes 2 checks per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, he writes \(2 \times 12 = 24\) checks to the church per year.

4. **Pest and lawn service checks:**
   - Buford writes 1 check per quarter.
   - There are 4 quarters in a year.
   - Therefore, he writes \(1 \times 4 = 4\) checks for the pest and lawn service per year.

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52
\]

Thus, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is \(\boxed{52}\)."
"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \).

The first plane's flights are distributed as follows:
- \( \frac{3}{4}F \) flights to Greece
- The remaining \( \frac{1}{4}F \) flights are split equally between France and Germany, so each gets \( \frac{1}{8}F \) flights.

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the first plane makes twice as many trips as the second plane:
\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we calculate the number of flights to France:
\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8}F = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11 \]

Thus, the number of flights to France is:

"To find the combined length of time the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum them up.

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - Combined howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the combined howl duration to minutes:**

"Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: \( A = 3 \) years
- Alessandro: \( L = 4 \) years
- Helene: \( H \) years
- Wilfred: \( W \) years

We are given that the total age of the children is 20 years:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known ages of Akbar and Alessandro:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

We are also given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Therefore, Helene's age \( H \) is:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the relationship between the sizes of the slices for adults and kids. Let the size of each kid's slice be \( x \). Since each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice, the size of each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total number of slices is 6 (2 adults and 4 kids). The total watermelon can be represented as the sum of all slices:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the entire watermelon is divided into 8 parts of size \( x \).

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we calculate:
\[ \frac{2x}{8x} \times 100\% = \frac{2}{8} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

1. **Calculate the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge before the last 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know this equals 28% of the total capacity.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge before the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge before the first 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know this equals 34.8% of the total capacity.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

"First, let's calculate Janet's total earnings per hour:
- Wages: $10/hour
- Tips: $15/hour
- Total earnings per hour: $10 + $15 = $25/hour

Next, calculate her weekly earnings:
- Hours worked per week: 40
- Weekly earnings: 40 hours * $25/hour = $1000/week

Now, determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment:
- Cost of the car: $10000
- Down payment: 20% of $10000 = 0.20 * $10000 = $2000

Finally, calculate the number of weeks needed to save the down payment:
- Weekly savings: $1000/week
- Number of weeks needed: $2000 / $1000/week = 2 weeks

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total spent so far:
\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount is:
\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

Each plum costs $0.25, so the number of plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"First, we calculate the total number of packs Anne gave to her friends. She had 15 packs and kept 2, so she gave away:

15 packs - 2 packs = 13 packs

Next, we determine the total number of pieces in the 13 packs she gave away. Each pack contains 60 pieces, so:

13 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 780 pieces

Now, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends to find out how many pieces each friend received. Anne has 10 friends, so:

780 pieces / 10 friends = 78 pieces/friend

Therefore, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future value (the price after three years),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

Plugging in the values:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

"To determine the number of guests currently in the hotel, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. **Initial number of guests:**
   The hotel was completely booked with 100 guests.

2. **Early checkouts:**
   24 guests checked out early.
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
   After the early checkouts, there are 76 guests remaining.

3. **Late checkouts:**
   15 guests elected for a late checkout.
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
   After the late checkouts, there are 61 guests remaining.

4. **Afternoon check-ins:**
   Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   30 guests checked in in the afternoon.
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
   After the afternoon check-ins, there are 91 guests.

5. **Evening check-ins:**
   7 more people checked in after dinner was served.
   \[

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the proportional relationship between the number of sandwiches and the cost. We can use the first two packages to find the ratio.

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, and the second package has 4 sandwiches for $6. We can see that the cost per sandwich is consistent across these two packages:
- Cost per sandwich in the first package: $3 / 2 = $1.50
- Cost per sandwich in the second package: $6 / 4 = $1.50

Since the cost per sandwich is $1.50, we can use this to find the cost of the third package, which contains 8 sandwiches:
- Cost of 8 sandwiches: 8 * $1.50 = $12

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

The share of the first person is \( x = 420 \).

"To find out how many hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Determine the fraction of a day they worked each day.
3. Convert the fraction of a day to hours.
4. Calculate the total hours worked by all painters.
5. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours each painter worked.

First, calculate the total number of days:
- 3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days

Next, determine the fraction of a day they worked each day:
- They worked 3/8 of a day each day.

Convert the fraction of a day to hours:
- 1 day = 24 hours
- 3/8 of a day = (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours

Calculate the total hours worked by all painters:
- Total hours per day for all painters = 9 hours
- Total hours for 21 days = 9 * 21 = 189 hours

Finally, divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours each painter worked:
- Number of painters = 4
- Hours each painter worked = 189 / 4 = 47.25 hours

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we can use the formula for exponential decay:

\[ P(t) = P_0 \cdot (1 - r)^t \]

where:
- \( P(t) \) is the price of the car at time \( t \),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price of the car,
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate,
- \( t \) is the number of years since the initial purchase.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 20000 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.21 \) (21%),
- \( t = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) years.

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P(3) = 20000 \cdot (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ P(3) = 20000 \cdot (0.79)^3 \]
\[ P(3) = 20000 \cdot 0.493039 \]
\[ P(3) \approx 9860.78 \]

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9860.78.

"To solve the problem, let's start by defining the number of slices each person ate in terms of the number of slices Jake ate. Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as \( J \).

According to the problem:
- Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Becky ate \( J + 3 \) slices.
- Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \( 2J \) slices.
- Becky ate 10 slices, so \( J + 3 = 10 \).

First, solve for \( J \):
\[ J + 3 = 10 \]
\[ J = 10 - 3 \]
\[ J = 7 \]

Now, we know:
- Jake ate 7 slices.
- Becky ate 10 slices.
- Silvia ate \( 2J = 2 \times 7 = 14 \) slices.

Next, calculate the total number of slices they ate:
\[ \text{Total slices} = J + (J + 3) + 2J \]
\[ \text{Total slices} = 7 + 10 + 14 \]
\[ \text{Total slices} = 31 \]

Thus, the total number of slices they ate is:

"Let's denote the time Donovan took to complete his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the times taken by Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:
\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which took 18 minutes longer, is:

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend.
3. Determine the discount Mr. Roger's friend received from the original price.
4. Convert this discount into a percentage of the original price.

Step 1: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Step 2: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend.
Mr. Rogers sold the watch at 120% of the price he paid.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Step 3: Determine the discount Mr. Roger's friend received from the original price.
The original price of the watch is $2000, and Mr. Roger's friend bought it for $1800.
\[ \text{Discount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

Step 4: Convert this discount into a percentage of the original price.
\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

Thus, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price is:

"To find out how many jellyfish 5 springs would create in 4 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of seconds in 4 hours.
2. Calculate the number of jellyfish one spring can create in that time.
3. Multiply that number by 5 to account for all the springs.

First, convert 4 hours into seconds:
4 hours = 4 × 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes
240 minutes = 240 × 60 seconds/minute = 14400 seconds

Next, since one spring creates one jellyfish every second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create:
14400 jellyfish

Since there are 5 springs, the total number of jellyfish created is:
14400 jellyfish/spring × 5 springs = 72000 jellyfish

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance James walked and then determine the time it took based on his walking speed.

1. **Distance from home to the store**: 4 miles.
2. **Halfway to the store**: 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.
3. **Distance walked to halfway point and back home**: 2 miles (to halfway) + 2 miles (back home) = 4 miles.
4. **Distance from home to the store after returning home**: 4 miles.

So, the total distance James walked is:
4 miles (to halfway and back) + 4 miles (to the store) = 8 miles.

5. **Walking speed**: 4 miles per hour.

To find the total time taken, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total time it took James to reach the store is 2 hours.

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost of the bananas both ways and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Each bunch averages 4 bananas.
- Total number of bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Cost per banana = $0.80.
- Total cost for 40 bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Cost per bunch = $3.00.
- Total cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

Finally, let's find the amount of money Jenny saved:
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Thus, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount Harry gets as \( H \).

According to the problem, the total amount of fence is 100 feet:
\[ S + H = 100 \]

It is also given that Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam:
\[ H = S + 60 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \):
\[ 2S = 100 - 60 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply by their respective prices.

1. **Total bikes sold**: 300
2. **Trekking bikes sold**: Half of the total bikes, so \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \) Trekking bikes.
3. **BMX bikes sold**: 15% of the total bikes, so \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \) BMX bikes.
4. **MTB bikes sold**: The rest of the bikes, so \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \) MTB bikes.

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- **Earnings from Trekking bikes**: \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \) dollars.
- **Earnings from BMX bikes**: \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \) dollars (since BMX bikes are half the price of MTB bikes, \( 500 / 2 = 250 \)).
- **Earnings from MTB bikes**: \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \) dollars.

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:
- **Total earnings**: \( 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250 \) dollars.

"To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field at the end of the 6-hour day, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck.

1. Calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer:
   - The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
   - Over 6 hours, the total number of bales made is \( 5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales} \).

2. Calculate the total number of bales picked up by the truck:
   - The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
   - Over 6 hours, the total number of bales picked up is \( 3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales} \).

3. Determine the number of bales left in the field:
   - Subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer.
   - \( 30 \text{ bales} - 18 \text{ bales} = 12 \text{ bales} \).

"First, let's calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class during a normal school day. Since there are 6 periods and he has 2 extra classes, he has a total of 8 classes per day. Each class is 40 minutes long.

\[ 8 \text{ classes/day} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of minutes he spends in class over the 5 school days.

\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

John also spends extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \( \frac{1}{16} \) of his weekly class minutes each day on these days.

\[ \frac{1600 \text{ minutes/week}}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he does this on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time over the weekend is:

\[ 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the extra learning time to the total class time to get the total weekly learning time.

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Finally, we convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours.

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the total weight of the triceratops in kilograms.
2. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so it ate \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
3. After the T-Rex ate, \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms of the triceratops were left.
4. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
5. After the velociraptors scavenged, \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms of the triceratops were left.
6. The Allosaurus then ate the last 270 kilograms, which is the remaining \( \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.

So, we have:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

Thus, the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 1080 kilograms.

"To determine the cost to paint the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

1. Calculate the area of the north and south walls:
   - Each wall is 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.
   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls = 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet.

2. Calculate the area of the east and west walls:
   - Each wall is 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.
   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls = 2 * 40 square feet = 80 square feet.

3. Calculate the total area of all four walls:
   - Total area = 160 square feet (north and south) + 80 square feet (east and west) = 240 square feet.

4. Determine the number of gallons of paint needed:
   - One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.
   - Number of gallons needed = Total area / Coverage per gallon = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.

5. Calculate the total cost of the paint:
   - Cost per gallon = $12.
   - Total cost = Number of gallons * Cost per gallon = 12 gallons * $12 = $144.

The total cost to paint the room is $144.

There are three women wearing 4-inch heels and three women wearing 2-inch heels.

First, calculate the total height of the 4-inch heels:
3 women * 4 inches = 12 inches

Next, calculate the total height of the 2-inch heels:
3 women * 2 inches = 6 inches

Now, add the total heights together:
12 inches + 6 inches = 18 inches

There are 6 women in total, so we divide the total height by the number of women to find the average height:
18 inches / 6 women = 3 inches

The average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her 9,300-mile journey in June, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of days in June:**
   June has 30 days.

2. **Calculate the total miles Soledad plans to hike each day:**
   Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which totals:
   \[
   125 \text{ miles/hike} \times 2 \text{ hikes/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total miles Soledad will hike in June with her current plan:**
   \[
   250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7,500 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Determine the additional miles needed to reach her goal:**
   \[
   9,300 \text{ miles} - 7,500 \text{ miles} = 1,800 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the additional miles per day Soledad needs to hike:**
   \[
   \frac{1,800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day}
   \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her 9,300-mile journey on time.

"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we first need to determine the weights of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog.

Kory’s dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah’s first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah’s second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weights of all the dogs together:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth originally had as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
3. Luis gave the remaining half of the stickers to Kris, so Kris received \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, Kris had \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers in total.

Since Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{S}{4} = 16 \]

To find \( S \), we solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 16 \times 4 \]
\[ S = 64 \]

Thus, Seth originally had 64 stickers.

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as \( A \), by Madeline as \( M \), by Camden as \( C \), and by Sarah as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( A + M + C + S = 56 \)
2. \( A = M \)
3. \( C + S = 30 \)
4. \( C = S + 12 \)

First, substitute \( A = M \) into the total equation:
\[ 2A + C + S = 56 \]

Next, substitute \( C = S + 12 \) into the equation \( C + S = 30 \):
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Substitute \( C = 21 \) and \( S = 9 \) back into the total equation:
\[ 2A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Thus, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"First, we need to determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make with 200 crayons. This is calculated by dividing the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per group:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Since each group goes into one box, there are 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes to get the combined weight:

\[ \text{Combined weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking, given the different speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

1. **Determine Grandma's speed on the beach:**
   - Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes.
   - Speed on the beach = \(\frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}}\).

2. **Determine Grandma's speed on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk.
   - Speed on the sidewalk = \(2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}\).

3. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk.
   - Time on the sidewalk = \(\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes}\).

4. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   - Time on the beach = 40 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug such that the mixture in Donny's water bottle is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug.
- The temperature of the water in the first mug is 33 degrees.
- Donny pours 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle.

The total volume of water in the water bottle is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces.

The temperature of the mixture in the water bottle can be calculated using the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs. The formula for the temperature of the mixture \( T_m \) is:

\[
T_m = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{5}
\]

We know that \( T_m \) must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{5} \geq 40
\]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):

\[
4 \times 33 = 132
\]

Substitute this into the inequality:

\[
\frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[
132 + T_2 \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T_2 \):

\[
T_2 \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is 68 degrees.

\[

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make:
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]
scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to determine how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, we can set up a proportion to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes} \times 18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops}} \]

"To determine the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to consider both the individual sunflowers and the sunflowers included in the bouquets.

1. **Calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day:**
   - Faraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers each day.
   - Each individual sunflower costs $2.
   - Number of individual sunflowers sold per day = \(\frac{26}{2} = 13\).

2. **Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:**
   - Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets each day.
   - Each bouquet costs $8.
   - Number of bouquets sold per day = \(\frac{56}{8} = 7\).

3. **Calculate the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day:**
   - Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day = \(7 \times 12 = 84\).

4. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:**
   - Total sunflowers sold per day = Number of individual sunflowers sold per day + Number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day.
   - Total sunflowers sold per day = \(13 + 84 = 97\).

"Let's denote the number of seashells collected by Carrey as \( C \).

According to the problem, Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so Carlos collected \( 2C \) seashells.

Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Jim collected \( 2C + 5 \) seashells.

We are given that Jim collected 27 seashells, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 2C + 5 = 27 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ 2C = 27 - 5 \]
\[ 2C = 22 \]
\[ C = 11 \]

So, Carrey collected 11 seashells, Carlos collected \( 2C = 22 \) seashells, and Jim collected 27 seashells.

The total number of seashells collected by all three is:
\[ 11 + 22 + 27 = 60 \]

2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, substitute \( R \) from the first equation into the third equation:
\[ 4B + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5B + Y = 37 \]

Next, substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the equation \( 5B + Y = 37 \):

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills} \]

Thomas then triples his money:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ bills} \]

Each of these 60 bills is a $20 bill, so the total amount of money he has is:
\[ 60 \times 20 = 1200 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, he converts all his money into $5 bills:
\[ \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills} \]

Thus, the number of $5 bills Thomas has is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2 + 8 = 10\)
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6 + 10 = 16\)

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk is left after Monday and then calculate how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk before it is less than 2 inches.

1. **Calculate the length of the chalk left after Monday:**
   - The original length of the chalk is 5 inches.
   - The teacher used 45% of the chalk on Monday.
   - The amount of chalk used on Monday is \( 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \) inches.
   - The length of the chalk left after Monday is \( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches.

2. **Determine how much chalk is used each subsequent day:**
   - The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - The amount of chalk used each day is \( 0.20 \times \text{remaining length} \).

3. **Calculate the length of the chalk after each subsequent day:**
   - **Day 1 (Tuesday):**
     - Chalk used: \( 0.20 \times 2.75 = 0.55 \) inches.
     - Chalk left: \( 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 \) inches.
   - **Day 2 (Wednesday):**
     - Chalk used: \( 0.20 \times 2.20 = 0.44 \) inches.
     - Chalk left: \( 2.20 - 0.44 = 1.76 \) inches.

4. **Determine the number of days before the chalk is less than 2 inches:**
   - After Tuesday, the chalk is 2.20 inches.
   - After Wednesday, the chalk is 1.76 inches, which is less than 2 inches.

Therefore, the teacher can use the chalk for 2 more days before it needs to be recycled.

"To find out how many students are not on varsity, we first need to calculate the number of boys and girls who are on varsity.

There are 12 girls in the class, and one-third of them are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity} \]

There are 12 boys in the class, and one-fourth of them are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity} \]

Next, we add the number of boys and girls on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ students on varsity} \]

The total number of students in the class is:
\[ 12 + 12 = 24 \]

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:
\[ 24 - 7 = 17 \]

"To find out how much Mr. Marcellus got in refunds, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased.
2. Determine the amount of milk that was returned.
3. Calculate the refund amount based on the returned milk.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased.
The total cost is the number of gallons purchased multiplied by the cost per gallon.
\[ \text{Total cost} = 4000 \, \text{gallons} \times \$3.5 \, \text{per gallon} = \$14,000 \]

Step 2: Determine the amount of milk that was returned.
The amount of milk returned is 2/5 of the total amount purchased.
\[ \text{Milk returned} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \, \text{gallons} = 1600 \, \text{gallons} \]

Step 3: Calculate the refund amount.
The refund amount is the cost per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons returned.
\[ \text{Refund amount} = 1600 \, \text{gallons} \times \$3.5 \, \text{per gallon} = \$5,600 \]

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of \$5,600.

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   This can be written as:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   This can be written as:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5C + 35
\]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]

Distribute the 3 on the left side:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[
75 = 2C + 35
\]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[
40 = 2C
\]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20
\]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices of each type of pizza her friends will consume and then convert that into the number of whole pizzas.

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends:
- Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices.
- There are 6 friends.

Total cheese pizza slices consumed:
\[ 6 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many whole cheese pizzas are required. Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends:
- Each friend eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices.
- There are 6 friends.

Total pepperoni pizza slices consumed:
\[ 4 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many whole pepperoni pizzas are required. Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} \]

Finally, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas to find the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Thus, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the net number of snowballs Jay can make per hour and then calculate how long it will take him to reach 60 snowballs.

1. **Determine the net number of snowballs made per hour:**
   - Jay makes 20 snowballs in an hour.
   - In one hour, there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes each.
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so in one hour, \(4 \times 2 = 8\) snowballs melt.
   - Therefore, the net number of snowballs made in one hour is \(20 - 8 = 12\).

2. **Calculate the time required to make 60 snowballs:**
   - Since Jay makes 12 snowballs per hour, we need to find out how many hours it will take to make 60 snowballs.
   - The time required is \(\frac{60}{12} = 5\) hours.

Thus, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of John and Jim when Digimon came out and then use that information to find Jim's current age.

1. **Determine the year Digimon came out:**
   - Digimon had its 20th anniversary, so it came out 20 years ago.
   - If the current year is 2023, then Digimon came out in 2023 - 20 = 2003.

2. **Determine John's age when Digimon came out:**
   - John is 28 years old now (in 2023).
   - Therefore, in 2003, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out:**
   - When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - If John was 8 years old, then Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

4. **Determine Jim's current age:**
   - Since 20 years have passed since 2003, Jim's current age is 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

Therefore, Jim is 24 years old now.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the usage and orders of bandages over the three days and work backwards to find out how many bandages they started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Used 38 bandages.
   - Ordered 1 bulk pack (50 bandages).

2. **Second Day:**
   - Used 10 fewer bandages than the first day: \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - Ordered 2 bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages).
   - Used half a pack: \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.

4. **End of the Third Day:**
   - They had 78 bandages left.

Let's calculate the total number of bandages used and ordered over the three days:

- **Total bandages used:**
  - First day: 38
  - Second day: 28
  - Third day: 25
  - Total used: \(38 + 28 + 25 = 91\) bandages.

- **Total bandages ordered:**
  - First day: 50
  - Third day: 100
  - Total ordered: \(50 + 100 = 150\) bandages.

Now, let's determine the initial number of bandages they started with on the first day. We know they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. We can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Initial bandages} + \text{Total ordered} - \text{Total used} = \text{Bandages left} \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ \text{Initial bandages} + 150 - 91 = 78 \]

Solve for the initial bandages:

\[ \text{Initial bandages} + 59 = 78 \]
\[ \text{Initial bandages} = 78 - 59 \]
\[ \text{Initial bandages} = 19 \]

Therefore, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information about the average distance walked by the dogs. The average distance is the total distance walked by all dogs divided by the number of dogs.

Given:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.
- The average distance walked by the dogs is 3 miles.
- There are 4 dogs in total.

First, we calculate the total distance walked by all dogs:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Average distance} \times \text{Number of dogs} \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 3 \, \text{miles/dog} \times 4 \, \text{dogs} = 12 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we find the total distance walked by the first three dogs:
\[ \text{Total distance for first three dogs} = 1 \, \text{mile} + 4 \, \text{miles} + 3 \, \text{miles} = 8 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we subtract the total distance walked by the first three dogs from the total distance to find the distance walked by the last dog:
\[ \text{Distance for the last dog} = 12 \, \text{miles} - 8 \, \text{miles} = 4 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

"To find out how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

1. **Cost of pasta per week**: $1.00
2. **Cost of cheddar cheese per week**: $3.00
3. **Cost of gruyere cheese per week**: $3.00 * 2 = $6.00

Now, let's add these costs to find the total weekly cost:
- Total weekly cost = Cost of pasta + Cost of cheddar cheese + Cost of gruyere cheese
- Total weekly cost = $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00

Next, we calculate the annual cost by multiplying the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year (52 weeks):
- Annual cost = Total weekly cost * 52
- Annual cost = $10.00 * 52 = $520.00

Therefore, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year.

"To find the percentage of the day the custodian spends cleaning classrooms, we first need to calculate the total time spent cleaning and then compare it to the total workday.

1. **Total time spent cleaning:**
   - Each classroom takes 15 minutes to clean.
   - There are 80 classrooms.
   - Total time = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes.

2. **Total time available in 5 days:**
   - Each day is 8 hours long.
   - 8 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day.
   - Over 5 days, total time available = 5 days * 480 minutes/day = 2400 minutes.

3. **Average time spent cleaning per day:**
   - Total time spent cleaning / Number of days = 1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes/day.

4. **Percentage of the day spent cleaning:**
   - (Time spent cleaning per day / Total time available per day) * 100
   - (240 minutes/day / 480 minutes/day) * 100 = 50%.

"To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the total number of books each bookcase can hold.

1. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
   - Total for middle shelves: \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books

2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf.
   - Bottom shelf: \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books

3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf.
   - Top shelf: \(20 - 5 = 15\) books

4. Now, we add up the total number of books each bookcase can hold:
   - Total per bookcase: \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books

5. Elly has 110 books in total. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books each bookcase can hold:
   - Number of bookcases: \(\frac{110}{55} = 2\)

"First, calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought. Since she bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \]

Next, determine the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Now, calculate the total revenue Rose will make by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. Therefore, the number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs is:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

So, the total revenue from selling 20 sets of 3 eggs at $1 each is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20.00 \]

Finally, calculate Rose's profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20.00 - 12.00 = 8.00 \]

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

The total number of ice cubes is 116:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

"To find the number of red blocks in the tower, we start by defining the number of each type of block:

- The number of blue blocks is 4.
- The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, so it is \(2 \times 4 = 8\).
- Let the number of red blocks be \(r\).

The total number of blocks in the tower is given as 32. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of blocks:

\[
4 + 8 + r = 32
\]

Next, we solve for \(r\):

\[
12 + r = 32
\]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[
r = 32 - 12

"To find out how many pink candies are in the bag, we first need to determine the number of each color of candy mentioned and then subtract the total from the overall number of candies in the bag.

1. Number of red candies: 54
2. Number of orange candies: Twice the number of red candies, so \( 54 \times 2 = 108 \)
3. Number of yellow candies: Half the number of red candies, so \( 54 \div 2 = 27 \)

Next, we add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[ 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 \]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
\[ 232 - 189 = 43 \]

Thus, the number of pink candies is:

"To find out how much Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels during her trip, we need to calculate the costs separately and then add them together.

1. **Hotel Cost:**
   - Helen stayed for 3 nights.
   - The cost of one night at the hotel is $80.
   - Total hotel cost = 3 nights * $80/night = $240.

2. **Bus Cost:**
   - Helen rode the bus 7 times.
   - Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
   - Cost of one bus trip = 10% of $80 = 0.10 * $80 = $8.
   - Total bus cost = 7 trips * $8/trip = $56.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost = Hotel cost + Bus cost = $240 + $56 = $296.

"To find the force John needs to push the car, we first need to calculate the total weight of the car, including the luggage and the children.

1. Weight of the car: 1200 pounds
2. Weight of the luggage: 250 pounds
3. Weight of the two children: 75 pounds each, so 75 * 2 = 150 pounds

Total weight = Weight of the car + Weight of the luggage + Weight of the children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

The force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight.

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds
Force = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

Therefore, the force John needs to push the car is 16 pounds.

"To determine how much John needs to spend on hot dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hot dogs needed for the party.
   - John invited 20 people, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs.
   - Total hot dogs needed = 20 guests * 2 hot dogs/guest = 40 hot dogs.

2. Determine the number of additional hot dogs John needs to buy.
   - John already has 4 hot dogs left over.
   - Additional hot dogs needed = Total hot dogs needed - Hot dogs already available
   - Additional hot dogs needed = 40 hot dogs - 4 hot dogs = 36 hot dogs.

3. Calculate the number of packs of hot dogs John needs to buy.
   - Each pack contains 6 hot dogs.
   - Number of packs needed = Additional hot dogs needed / Hot dogs per pack
   - Number of packs needed = 36 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs/pack = 6 packs.

4. Calculate the total cost of the packs of hot dogs.

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes each night. Therefore, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

   - The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers

3. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as \( x \).

The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench can be expressed as:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \]
\[ 31 - x = 29 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 31 - 29 = x \]
\[ x = 2 \]

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers.

"To determine how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables and then subtract this from the total number of screws he has.

1. Calculate the total number of legs for 4 tables:
   \[
   4 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs per table} = 16 \text{ legs}
   \]

2. Calculate the total number of screws needed for 16 legs:
   \[
   16 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws per leg} = 32 \text{ screws}
   \]

3. Subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws James has:
   \[
   40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws}
   \]

James will have 8 screws left over.

"First, let's determine how much each person raised:

- Alexandra raised $430.
- Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
- Sarah raised $300.
- Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up the amounts raised by all four girls:

- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Sarah: $300
- Maryam: $700

Total amount raised = $430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $2180

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race. Let's break down the information given:

1. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
2. Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran 2 miles.
3. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.
4. Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.

First, we calculate Aaron's speed. Since Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, his speed is:
\[ \text{Aaron's speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is:
\[ \text{Vanessa's speed} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{16 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles. Using her speed:
\[ \text{Time for Vanessa} = 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we subtract the 6 feet of new line he already has from the total required:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes a week, we need to calculate the total revenue from reservations for the days they are open.

1. Calculate the total cost per reservation:
   - 2 meals at $5 each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars
   - 1 bottle of wine at $5: \(5\) dollars
   - Total cost per reservation: \(10 + 5 = 15\) dollars

2. Calculate the total revenue per night:
   - 6 reservations per night: \(6 \times 15 = 90\) dollars

3. Calculate the total revenue for the week:
   - Open 2 days a week: \(2 \times 90 = 180\) dollars

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we first need to calculate the total selling price of all the watermelons and then divide that by the number of watermelons.

1. Calculate the total cost price of the watermelons:
   - The fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.

2. Calculate the total profit:
   - The profit is 25% of the total cost price.
   - Profit = 25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20.

3. Calculate the total selling price:
   - Total selling price = Total cost price + Total profit
   - Total selling price = $80 + $20 = $100.

4. Calculate the selling price per watermelon:
   - Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
   - Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50 = $2.

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dora's current age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - Therefore, Dora's current age is \( 12 - 3 = 9 \) years old.

2. **Determine James's current age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora.
   - Therefore, James's current age is \( 2 \times 9 = 18 \) years old.

3. **Determine John's current age:**
   - John had James when he was 19.
   - Therefore, John's current age is \( 18 + 19 = 37 \) years old.

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - Therefore, the youngest son's current age is \( 37 - 32 = 5 \) years old.

5. **Determine the youngest son's age in 3 years:**
   - The youngest son will be \( 5 + 3 = 8 \) years old in 3 years.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in one hour and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour = \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges} \).

2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour = \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges} \).

3. **Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:**
   - Difference = Number of oranges Ana can peel - Number of oranges Jane can peel
   - Difference = 20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"First, calculate the discount on the radiator:
80% off of $400 is calculated as $400 * 0.80 = $320 discount.

So, the cost of the radiator after the discount is:
$400 - $320 = $80.

Next, calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor:
3 hours * $50/hour = $150.

Finally, add the cost of the radiator and the labor to find the total cost:
$80 + $150 = $230.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens and \( k \) represent the number of cows.

1. The total number of animals is 20:
   \[
   c + k = 20
   \]

2. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[
   2c + 4k = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   \[
   c + 2k = 35
   \]

Now we have the system of equations:
   \[
   c + k = 20
   \]
   \[
   c + 2k = 35
   \]

Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( c \):
   \[
   (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20
   \]
   \[
   k = 15
   \]

Now substitute \( k = 15 \) back into the first equation:
   \[
   c + 15 = 20
   \]
   \[
   c = 5
   \]

So, the number of chickens is \( c = 5 \).
