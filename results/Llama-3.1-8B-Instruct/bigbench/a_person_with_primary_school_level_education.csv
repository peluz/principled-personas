"Let's break down the clues:

1. The flutist lives in the second house.
2. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.
3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
4. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.

From clue 1, we know the flutist lives in the second house. 

From clue 4, there is one house between the flutist and the pianist. This means the pianist lives in either the third or the fourth house. 

If the pianist lives in the fourth house, then the flutist would be in the second house and the pianist would be in the fourth house, which would leave the first and third houses for the guitarist and the person with a vase of tulips or the person with a bouquet of lilies and the person with a carnations arrangement. 

However, from clue 2, the person with a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist. This means the guitarist cannot be in the first house because there is no one to the left of the guitarist. So, the guitarist must be in the third house. 

From clue 3, the person with a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person with a carnations arrangement. This means the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in the first house and the person with a carnations arrangement must be in the second house. 

However, this contradicts clue 1, which says the flutist lives in the second house. 

So, the pianist must be in the third house. 

From clue 2, the person with a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist. This means the person with a vase of tulips must be in the first house and the guitarist must be in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 1."

1. The person who has a television lives in the first house.

From clue 4, the history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. This means the history book buff cannot live in the second house because the mystery book reader lives there. So, the history book buff must live in the first house.

From clue 5, the percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a computer. This means the percussionist cannot live in the first house because the history book buff lives there. So, the percussionist must live in the second house, but we already know the mystery book reader lives in the second house. This means the percussionist and the mystery book reader must switch places, so the percussionist lives in the second house and the mystery book reader lives in the first house.

From clue 6, the fish enthusiast does not live in the first house. Since the history book buff lives in the first house, the fish enthusiast must live in the third house.

From clue 7, the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the person who has a gameboy must live in the first house because the history book buff lives in the first house.

Since the fish enthusiast lives in the third house, the cellist must live in the second house, but we already know the percussionist lives in the second house. This means the cellist and the percussionist must switch places, so the cellist lives in the second house and the percussionist lives in the third house.

Now we have the following information:
- The history book buff lives in the first house.
- The mystery book reader lives in the first house (but we already know the history book buff lives in the first house, so the mystery book reader must live in the second house is incorrect, the mystery book reader lives in the first house is correct)
- The percussionist lives in the third house.
- The fish enthusiast lives in the third house.
- The cellist lives in the second house.
- The person who has a gameboy lives in the first house.

The correct order is:
1. History book buff
2. Mystery book reader
3. Fish enthusiast

The person who has a gameboy lives in the first house, so the answer is (A) 1."

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the second house.
2. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.
3. The mystery book reader lives in the third house.
4. The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
5. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the romance book lover.

From clue 3, we know the mystery book reader lives in the third house.

From clue 5, we know the person wearing sandals lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the person wearing sandals must live in the first house, and the romance book lover must live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing high heels does not live in the second house. Since the person wearing sandals lives in the first house, and the romance book lover lives in the second house, the person wearing high heels must live in the fourth house.

From clue 2, we know the history book buff lives to the right of the person wearing loafers. This means the person wearing loafers must live in the first house (since the person wearing sandals is already in the first house), and the history book buff must live in the fourth house.

So, the order of the houses is:
- House 1: Person wearing loafers (history book buff)
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Mystery book reader
- House 4: Person wearing high heels

The mystery book reader lives in the third house, so the correct answer is (B) 3."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
From these two clues, we can conclude that the person who likes green lives in house 1, the person who has a gameboy lives in house 2, and the person who has a computer lives in house 3.

3. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.
Since the person who likes green lives in house 1 and the person who has a gameboy lives in house 2, the person who likes yellow must live in house 3.

So, the order is: 
- House 1: person who likes green
- House 2: person who has a gameboy
- House 3: person who likes yellow and has a computer

The answer is (C) 3."

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
2. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
3. The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
4. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1. 

From clue 1, the person who likes green lives in house 2 because the person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio, and the person with a radio can't be in house 1 because the fantasy book enthusiast lives there.

From clue 4, the person who had pizza lives in house 2 because the person who had pizza does not live in the first house.

From clue 3, the fish enthusiast lives in house 1 because the fish enthusiast does not live in the first house, and the person with a radio can't be in house 2 because the person who likes green lives there.

Now we have the following information:
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast, fish enthusiast, and radio
- House 2: Person who likes green, person who had pizza, and cat lover

The only one left is the person who has a phone, and the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes green lives in house 2, the person who likes yellow must live in house 1.

From clue 8, the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.

From clue 3, the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fifth house. 

From clue 8, the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other. This means the person who ate grilled cheese cannot live in the fifth house either.

From clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

From clue 2, the person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating apples.

- The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese (clue 1). The person who has a rose bouquet cannot live in the first house because the person who has a bouquet of daffodils cannot live in the fifth house. The person who has a rose bouquet must live in the second house.

- The person who has a bouquet of daffodils cannot live in the fifth house, so the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in the third house.

- The person who has a vase of tulips lives next to the person who ate grilled cheese (clue 8). The person who has a vase of tulips cannot live in the fifth house, so the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the fourth house.

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
2. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
3. There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
4. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From clue 5, we know the cat lover lives in the first house. 

From clue 1, the person with tulips lives to the left of the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in the first house, the dog owner must be in the second house (because the cat lover is in the first house and the dog owner is to the right of the cat lover).

From clue 2, the person with daffodils does not live in the second house, so the person with daffodils must live in either the first or the third house. But since the cat lover is in the first house, the person with daffodils must live in the third house.

From clue 3, there is one house between the person who owns horses and the person who has a carnations arrangement. This means the person with carnations must live in the fourth house (because there is one house between the person with horses and the person with carnations).

From clue 4, the person with lilies lives to the right of the person with horses. Since the person with carnations is in the fourth house, the person with horses must be in the second house (because the person with lilies lives to the right of the person with horses and the person with carnations is in the fourth house).

Now we have the following order: 
- House 1: cat lover
- House 2: person with horses
- House 3: person with daffodils
- House 4: person with carnations

The only person left is the fish enthusiast. Since the fish enthusiast is not the cat lover, the person with horses, the person with daffodils, or the person with carnations, the fish enthusiast must live in the second house is taken by the person with horses, so the fish enthusiast must live in the first house is taken by the cat lover, so the fish enthusiast must live in the third house is taken by the person with daffodils, so the fish enthusiast must live in the fourth house.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who has a phone lives in the first house.
2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
3. The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live directly next to each other.

From clue 1, we know the person with a phone lives in house 1. 

From clue 2, we know the person with boots does not live in house 2, so they must live in house 1. But we already know the person in house 1 has a phone, so the person in house 1 must be wearing high heels, not boots.

From clue 3, we know the person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live next to each other. Since the person with a phone lives in house 1, the person with a radio must live in house 2, and the person with horses must live in house 1.

So, the person in house 1 is wearing high heels, and the person in house 2 is wearing boots. 

The answer is (B) 1."

3. The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
4. There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
5. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the tea drinker lives in house 1.

From clue 2, the person eating apples lives to the left of the person driving a minivan. This means the person eating apples can't live in house 1 (tea drinker), so they must live in house 2 or 3.

From clue 3, the person driving a convertible lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. This means the science fiction book fanatic can't live in house 3 (convertible), so they must live in house 1 or 2.

From clue 4, there is one house between the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker. This means the coffee drinker can't live in house 1 (tea drinker) or house 3 (convertible), so they must live in house 2.

From clue 5, the person eating oranges can't live in house 2. This means the person eating oranges must live in house 1 or 3.

Now, let's put it all together:

- House 1: tea drinker
- House 2: coffee drinker
- House 3: 

From clue 2, the person eating apples lives to the left of the person driving a minivan. This means the person eating apples must live in house 2 (coffee drinker) or house 1 (tea drinker). But the tea drinker is in house 1, so the person eating apples must live in house 2. This means the person driving a minivan must live in house 3.

From clue 3, the person driving a convertible lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. This means the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 1 (tea drinker) or house 2 (coffee drinker). But the coffee drinker is in house 2, so the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 1. This means the person eating oranges must live in house 3.

From clue 4, there is one house between the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker. This means the fantasy book enthusiast must live in house 1 (tea drinker) or house 3 (minivan).

From clue 1, the person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader. This means the mystery book reader lives in the third house because the person who likes red is in the second house.

From clue 3, the person who likes white does not live in the third house. This means the person who likes white lives in either the first or the second house. But we already know the person who likes red lives in the second house. So, the person who likes white must live in the first house.

From clue 2, the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house. This means the fantasy book enthusiast lives in either the second or the third house. But we already know the person who likes red lives in the second house. So, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the third house.

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who has a radio and the person who drives a truck live directly next to each other.
2. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
3. The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
4. The root beer lover does not live in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the person with a radio and the person with a truck live next to each other. 

From clue 2, the person with a radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza. 

From clue 3, the person eating grapes lives to the left of the person with a computer.

From clue 4, the root beer lover does not live in the first house.

Let's try to put the information together:

- The person with a radio and the person with a truck live next to each other. 
- The person with a radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza.
- The person eating grapes lives to the left of the person with a computer.

If the person with a radio lives in the first house, then the person with a truck lives in the second house. But the person with a truck and the person with a radio live next to each other, so the person with a radio cannot live in the first house. 

So, the person with a radio lives in the second house. The person with a truck lives in the first house.

Now, the person eating grapes lives to the left of the person with a computer. The person with a computer cannot live in the first house because the person with a radio lives in the second house. So, the person with a computer lives in the second house. The person eating grapes lives in the first house.

The person eating grapes lives in the first house, and the person with a computer lives in the second house. The person with a radio lives in the second house, and the person with a truck lives in the first house.

The person who had pizza lives to the right of the person with a radio. The person with a radio lives in the second house, so the person who had pizza lives in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."

From clue 1, the first house is the tea drinker.

From clue 5, the person who had pizza lives in the second house.

But the first house is the tea drinker, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the second house is incorrect. The person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house.

From clue 6, the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. So the person who likes white lives in the third house.

From clue 4, the person who only drinks water lives next to the person who likes white. So the person who only drinks water lives in the third house.

From clue 7, the person who likes green does not live in the first house.

From clue 8, the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house. The first house is the tea drinker, the second house is the person who had pizza, and the third house is the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water.

From clue 8, the person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.

From clue 4, the dog owner lives in the third house.

From clue 12, the person who likes white lives in the third house. Since the dog owner lives in the third house, the person who likes white is the dog owner.

This means the person who likes milk lives in the first house (since there are no houses between the first and second house) or the third house (since there are two houses between the third and first house). But the first house is occupied by the fish enthusiast, so the person who likes milk lives in the third house.

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.
2. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
3. The soccer player lives in the third house.
4. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
5. The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.

From clue 3, we know the soccer player lives in the third house. 

From clue 1, the golfer lives directly left of the basketball player. This means the order of the houses is either: Golfer-Basketball-Soccer or Basketball-Golfer-Soccer.

From clue 2, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person with lilies.

From clue 4, the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

From clue 5, the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house, which means the person with tulips lives in either the first or second house.

Now, let's combine the information:

- The person with lilies lives left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives left of the person who ate spaghetti.
- The person with tulips does not live in the third house.

If the order is Golfer-Basketball-Soccer, then the person with lilies would have to live in the first house, the person who ate grilled cheese in the second house, and the person with tulips in the first house, which contradicts clue 5.

So, the order is Basketball-Golfer-Soccer.

Now, let's try to fit the remaining information:

- The person with lilies lives left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives left of the person who ate spaghetti.
- The person with tulips does not live in the third house.

If the person with lilies lives in the first house, then the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house, and the person with tulips lives in the second house, which contradicts clue 5.

So, the person with lilies lives in the second house, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house, and the person with tulips lives in the third house.

Now, let's fit the remaining information:

- The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

This means the golfer lives in the first house, the person with lilies lives in the second house, and the basketball player lives in the third house.

So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues to find the house number of the person who ate fried rice.

4. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
6. The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
7. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the tea drinker lives in the third house.

From clue 6, the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. Since the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese (clue 4), the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house. The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water must live in the second and third houses, but since the tea drinker lives in the third house, the person who is wearing high heels must live in the second house.

From clue 4, the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese, so the person who only drinks water lives in the third house.

From clue 1, the tea drinker lives in the third house, so the person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.

From clue 6, the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other, so the person who only drinks water lives in the third house.

From clue 2, the person who had stew lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house, the person who had stew must live in the first house.

From clue 5, the person who is wearing running shoes lives to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew lives in the first house, the person who is wearing running shoes must live in the first house.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Let's break down the clues to find the house number of the person who has a computer.

From clue 8, the soccer player and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.

"Let's break it down step by step.

We know:
- The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
- The houses are numbered 1 and 2 from left to right.

If the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic, it means the science fiction book fanatic must live in the left house (house 1) because if they lived in the right house (house 2), the person who ate fried rice would be to the left of the science fiction book fanatic, which is not possible.

So, the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The pianist lives in the first house.
2. The root beer lover lives to the right of the person who owns horses.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the pianist lives in house 1. 

From clue 3, we know the person who likes white does not live in house 2, so the person who likes white must live in house 1. But we already know the pianist lives in house 1, so the person who likes white must be the pianist. However, the pianist is in house 1, so the person who likes white is in house 1, which is not possible. This means the person who likes white must be in house 2.

Now we know the person who likes white lives in house 2. From clue 1, the pianist lives in house 1. From clue 2, the root beer lover lives to the right of the person who owns horses. Since the person who likes white lives in house 2, the person who owns horses must live in house 1 (because the root beer lover lives to the right of the person who owns horses).

Now we know the person who owns horses lives in house 1 and the pianist lives in house 1. The person who owns horses and the pianist are in house 1, so the dog owner must live in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
2. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
3. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the person eating apples lives in the third house. 

From clue 2, the person eating mangos lives directly left of the person eating apples, so the person eating mangos lives in the second house.

From clue 3, the coffee drinker does not live in the second house, so the coffee drinker lives in the first house.

From clue 1, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk, so the person who likes milk lives in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.
2. The person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
3. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
5. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
6. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
7. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

From clue 4, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house. 

From clue 3, the person who likes white lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. This means the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house (because the person who likes white can't live in the first house, as there is no one to the left of them).

From clue 1, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house. This means the person who has a vase of tulips is the science fiction book fanatic.

From clue 7, the person who has a vase of tulips (science fiction book fanatic) lives to the left of the person who likes red. This means the person who likes red lives in the third house.

From clue 2, the person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the third house as well.

From clue 5, the person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house. This means the person who is wearing boots lives in either the first or the second house.

From clue 6, the history book buff lives to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house, the history book buff must live in the third house. But we already know the person in the third house is wearing loafers and likes red. This means the history book buff must live in the third house, which is a contradiction. 

However, we can conclude that the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house, the person who likes red lives in the third house, and the person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house. This means the person who is wearing boots lives in the first house.

The answer is (B) 1."

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The tennis player lives to the left of the person with a television.
2. The golfer does not live in the second house.
3. The person with a computer and the person with tulips live next to each other.
4. The person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a rose bouquet.
5. The person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a television.

From clue 1, we know the tennis player lives to the left of the person with a television.

From clue 3, we know the person with a computer and the person with tulips live next to each other. 

From clue 4, we know the person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a rose bouquet.

- The tennis player lives to the left of the person with a television.
- The person with a computer and the person with tulips live next to each other.
- The person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a television and the person with a rose bouquet.

Considering the clues, let's try to place the people in the houses:

- The person with a computer and the person with tulips live next to each other. They can't live in house 1 because the tennis player lives to the left of the person with a television, and the person with a computer and the person with tulips live next to each other. So, they must live in house 2 or house 3.

- If the person with a computer and the person with tulips live in house 2, then the person with a computer must live in house 2 because the person with a computer and the person with tulips live next to each other.

- If the person with a computer and the person with tulips live in house 3, then the person with a computer must live in house 3 because the person with a computer and the person with tulips live next to each other.

Now, let's consider the person with a radio. The person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a television and the person with a rose bouquet. If the person with a computer lives in house 2, then the person with a radio must live in house 3. But the person with a computer and the person with tulips live next to each other, so the person with a computer must live in house 2.

Now, let's place the people in the houses:

- House 1: The person with a rose bouquet (because the person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a rose bouquet)
- House 2: The person with a computer and the person with tulips (because they live next to each other)
- House 3: The person with a radio (because the person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a television and the person with a rose bouquet)

Now, let's place the tennis player. The tennis player lives to the left of the person with a television. The person with a television lives in house 3, so the tennis player must live in house 1.

Now, let's place the golfer. The golfer does not live in the second house, so the golfer must live in house 1 or house 3. But the tennis player lives in house 1, so the golfer must live in house 3.

Now, let's place the person with a television. The person with a television lives in house 3, and the person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a television. The person with a radio lives in house 3, so the person with a television lives in house 3.

Now, let's place the person with a computer. The person with a computer lives in house 2.

3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
4. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.
5. The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.

From clue 1, we know the person who likes green lives in the third house.

From clue 2, the person who likes yellow lives in the second house because the person who likes green lives in the third house and they live next to each other.

From clue 5, the person who had stew lives in the first house because the person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover, and the person who likes yellow lives in the second house.

From clue 3, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house because the person who had stew lives in the first house and the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the right of the person who had stew.

From clue 4, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house because the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house, but we already know the person who likes yellow lives in the second house, so the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house.

Now we have the following information:
- The person who likes green lives in the third house.
- The person who likes yellow lives in the second house.
- The person who had stew lives in the first house.
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house.
- The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.

The only person left is the person who likes blue, and they must live in the first house.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Let's break down the clues to find the answer.

From clue 7, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.

From clue 1, the person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other. Since the person with carnations lives in the first house, the person with tulips and the bird keeper must live in the second and third houses.

From clue 6, the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other. Since the person with tulips and the bird keeper live in the second and third houses, the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue must live in the second and third houses as well.

From clue 6, the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other. This means the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue must be in the second and third houses, but the person who owns horses must be in the second house because the person with tulips and the bird keeper are in the second and third houses.

From clue 6, the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other. This means the person who likes blue must be in the third house.

From clue 4, the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. But we already know the person who likes blue lives in the third house. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate the clues.

From clue 4, the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. This means the person who likes blue must live in the second house.

From clue 6, the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other. This means the person who owns horses must live in the second house.

From clue 1, the person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other. This means the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the first house, and the bird keeper must live in the third house.

The correct order is: 
- House 1: carnations arrangement
- House 2: tulips
- House 3: bird keeper

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
2. The cellist lives in the first house.
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

From clue 1 and 2, we know the person in the first house is both a fantasy book reader and a cellist.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person in the first house is a cellist and a fantasy book reader, the person in the second house must be the pianist (because the pianist is the only one left).

Now, we know the person in the first house likes fantasy books and is a cellist, and the person in the second house is a pianist. We also know the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes red. 

Since the person in the first house is a fantasy book reader, the person in the second house must be the mystery book reader (because the mystery book reader is the only one left).

So, the mystery book reader lives in the second house, which is house number 2. The answer is (B)."

"Let's break down the clues:

1. There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives.
2. The golfer lives in the second house.
3. The history book buff lives in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the history book buff lives in the first house. 

From clue 2, we know the golfer lives in the second house.

So, the order of the houses is: History book buff (1), Golfer (2), ? (3)

Now, let's use clue 1. It says there is one house between the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic. This means the swimmer cannot live in the first house (because there would be no house between them and the science fiction book fanatic), and the swimmer cannot live in the third house (because there would be two houses between them and the science fiction book fanatic).

So, the swimmer must live in the third house."
"Let's break down the clues to find the solution.

From clue 8, the bird keeper lives in the third house.

From clue 7, the person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the soccer player. Since the bird keeper is in the third house, the person eating a banana must be in the second house.

From clue 1, the swimmer lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. Since the person eating a banana is in the second house, the swimmer must be in the first house, and the person eating apples must be in the third house.

From clue 8, the bird keeper is in the third house, so the person eating apples is also in the third house. This contradicts the previous conclusion that the person eating apples is in the third house. This means the person eating apples must be in the second house, and the bird keeper must be in the fourth house.

From clue 7, the person eating a banana lives directly left of the soccer player. Since the person eating apples is in the second house, the person eating a banana must be in the first house, and the soccer player must be in the third house.

From clue 5, the cat lover lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in the first house, the cat lover must be in the second house, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in the third house.

From clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in the third house, the history book buff must be in the fourth house.

From clue 4, the person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house. Since the history book buff is in the fourth house, the person who ate fried rice must be in the first house.

From clue 10, the person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in the second house, the person who is eating grapes must be in the first house.

From clue 2, the romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer. Since the swimmer is in the first house, the romance book lover must be in the fourth house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: person eating grapes, science fiction book fanatic
- House 2: person eating apples, fantasy book enthusiast
- House 3: person eating banana, soccer player
- House 4: bird keeper, romance book lover

However, this arrangement is not possible because the person eating a banana lives directly left of the soccer player, but the person eating apples is in the second house, not the first house.

Let's re-examine the clues.

From clue 8, the bird keeper lives in the third house.

From clue 7, the person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the soccer player. Since the bird keeper is in the third house, the person eating a banana must be in the second house, and the soccer player must be in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the cat lover lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in the second house, the cat lover must be in the first house, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in the second house.

From clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in the second house, the history book buff must be in the third house.

From clue 4, the person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house. Since the history book buff is in the third house, the person who ate fried rice must be in the first house.

From clue 10, the person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in the third house, the person who is eating grapes must be in the second house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: person eating grapes, cat lover

- House 3: person eating banana, fantasy book enthusiast
- House 4: bird keeper, romance book lover

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house.
2. The person who likes white lives in the first house.
3. The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
4. The person who likes green lives in the second house.
5. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
6. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
7. The person who had stew does not live in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes white lives in the first house.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes green lives in the second house.

From clue 7, we know the person who had stew does not live in the second house, so the person who had stew must live in the third house.

From clue 6, we know the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew lives in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the first or second house.

From clue 5, we know the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who had stew lives in the third house, the person who is wearing high heels must live in the second or third house. But we already know the person who likes green lives in the second house, so the person who is wearing high heels must live in the third house.

So, the order of the houses is: 1, 2, 3.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes white lives in the first house.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes green lives in the second house.

From clue 7, we know the person who had stew lives in the third house.

From clue 3, we know the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or third house. But we already know the person who likes white lives in the first house, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house.

From clue 6, we know the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew lives in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house.

From clue 5, we know the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who is wearing high heels lives in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house.

So, the order of the houses is: 1, 2, 3.

The person who is wearing boots lives in the first house, the person who likes green lives in the second house, and the person who had stew lives in the third house.

The only option left is the person who ate fried rice. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, and the person who likes white lives in the first house. So, the person who ate fried rice must live in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. The romance book lover lives to the right of the person with carnations and to the left of the person with tulips.
3. The romance book lover lives directly left of the person with tulips.
4. The person with a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other.
5. The person with a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the person with a rose bouquet lives in the second house. Since the person with a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other (clue 4), the science fiction book fanatic must live in the third house.

Now, let's look at clue 1: The fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the first house.

From clue 3, the romance book lover lives directly left of the person with tulips. Since the person with tulips can't live in the first or third house (because the fantasy book enthusiast and science fiction book fanatic live in those houses), the person with tulips must live in the fourth house. This means the romance book lover lives in the second house.

Now, we have the following arrangement: 
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: Person with tulips

The only person left is the person with lilies. Since the person with a rose bouquet lives in the second house, the person with lilies must live in the first house is not possible because the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house. The person with lilies can't live in the third house because the science fiction book fanatic lives there. The person with lilies can't live in the second house because the romance book lover lives there. Therefore, the person with lilies must live in the fourth house.

The answer is (C) 4."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
2. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1. 

From clue 1, we know the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearing sandals. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in house 1, the coffee drinker must be in house 1 as well because there's no other house to the left of house 1. This means the person wearing sandals must be in house 2.

Now, we know the person in house 1 is the science fiction book fanatic and the coffee drinker. The person in house 2 is the one wearing sandals. 

The only person left is the romance book lover, who must be in house 2 because the person in house 2 is not the science fiction book fanatic or the coffee drinker.

So, the romance book lover lives in house 2. The answer is (B)."
"Let's figure it out step by step.

1. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a radio. This means the person with the radio lives in the house on the right (house 2), and the percussionist lives in the house on the left (house 1).

2. We know the pianist and percussionist are in different houses. Since the percussionist is in house 1, the pianist must be in house 2.

3. We also know the person in house 1 has a percussion instrument, and the person in house 2 has a radio. The person in house 2 is the pianist, and the person in house 1 is the percussionist.

4. The only device left is the phone, which must be in the house of the person who is not the pianist or the percussionist. Since the pianist is in house 2, the person in house 1 must have the phone.

So, the person who has a phone lives in house 1. The answer is (A)."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

From clue 1, we know the person who drives a convertible lives in house 2.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. This means the person who likes yellow cannot live in house 2 (because the person in house 2 drives a convertible), so the person who likes yellow must live in either house 1 or house 3.

From clue 2, we know there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives. This means the person who owns a sedan cannot live in house 1 (because there would be no house between the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan). So, the person who owns a sedan must live in house 3.

Since the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan, and the person who owns a sedan lives in house 3, the person who likes yellow must live in house 2. But we already know the person in house 2 drives a convertible. This is a contradiction.

However, we can try another option. If the person who likes yellow lives in house 1, then the person who owns a sedan lives in house 3, and the person who likes white lives in house 2. This satisfies all the clues.

So, the person who likes yellow lives in house 1. The answer is (A)."
"Let's break down the clues to find the house number of the person who owns horses.

From clue 1, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.

From clue 2, the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

From clue 3, the dog owner does not live in the third house.

From clue 5, there are two houses between where the person who is wearing running shoes lives and where the bird keeper lives. Since the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house, the bird keeper lives in the fourth or fifth house.

From clue 4, the person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper. This means the person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house.

From clue 10, the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the fifth house. This means the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second or third house. However, from clue 2, the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house, so the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.

From clue 9, the person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. This means the person who is wearing high heels lives in the first house, but we already know the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.

"Let's break down the clues:

3. The root beer lover and the guitarist live next to each other.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover and the guitarist live next to each other. Since they live next to each other, one of them must live in house 1 and the other in house 2.

Now, let's look at clue 2: The history book buff lives to the left of the cat lover. This means the cat lover cannot live in house 1 because if the cat lover lived in house 1, the history book buff would have to live in house 2, but then the root beer lover and the guitarist would have to live in house 1 and house 2, which is not possible because they live next to each other.

So, the cat lover must live in house 2. This means the history book buff lives in house 1.

If the dog owner is in house 1, then the bird keeper must be in house 2, and the person with carnations must be in house 3. But this would mean the person with tulips (in house 2) is to the left of the bird keeper, which contradicts clue 1.

2. The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.
3. The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
4. The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.
5. The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.
6. The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.

From clue 1, the person eating mangos lives in house 1.

From clue 2, the person who owns horses does not live in house 1, so they can live in house 2, 3, or 4.

From clue 3, the bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other. Since they live next to each other, they can't live in house 1 (mangos) and house 4 (because there's no space between them). So, they must live in house 2 and 3.

From clue 4, the person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house. This means the person eating a banana must live in house 1, 2, or 4.

From clue 6, the person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the person eating a banana can't live in the third house, and the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis live in house 2 and 3, the person eating a banana must live in house 2. This means the dog owner lives in house 3.

Now, we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: person eating mangos
- House 2: person eating banana
- House 3: dog owner
- House 4: person eating kiwis and bird keeper

From clue 3, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis live directly next to each other. Since they live in house 4, the bird keeper must live in house 4.

From clue 4, we know the mystery book reader lives in the first house. 

From clue 3, the bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the history book buff cannot live in the first house because the bird keeper would have to live in the first house, and there's no space for the history book buff to live directly left of the bird keeper. So, the history book buff must live in the second house, and the bird keeper lives in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Bird keeper
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Unknown

From clue 1, the romance book lover does not live in the third house. This means the romance book lover must live in either the first or second house.

From clue 2, the person who owns horses does not live in the third house. This means the person who owns horses must live in either the first or second house.

Since the bird keeper lives in the first house, the person who owns horses must live in the second house. This leaves the first house for the romance book lover.

But we already know the coffee drinker lives in the second house, so this is a contradiction. 

However, we can try another combination. If the person who is eating apples lives in the first house, then the person who only drinks water lives in the second house. The coffee drinker lives in the second house, so this combination works.

From clue 3, the person who is eating mangos does not live in the first house. This is already satisfied.

From clue 4, the person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house. This is already satisfied.

- House 4: person eating kiwis

The coffee drinker lives in the second house. The correct answer is (D) 2."

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
2. The basketball player lives in the second house.
3. The violinist lives in the second house.

From clue 2 and 3, we know the violinist and basketball player live in the second house. Since they are different people, they must be in the same house, but we don't know which one is which yet.

From clue 1, the cellist lives to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer can't be in the second house because the cellist would have to be in the third house, and the violinist/basketball player would have to be in the second house, but the violinist is already in the second house. 

So, the cricketer must be in the first house. The cellist can't be in the first house because the cricketer is there, so the cellist must be in the third house.

Now we have: 
- Cricketer in house 1
- Cellist in house 3
- Violinist and basketball player in house 2

The only person left is the soccer player. Since the violinist and basketball player are in house 2, the soccer player must be in either house 1 or house 3. But the cricketer is in house 1, so the soccer player must be in house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The violinist lives in the first house.
2. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.

From clue 1, we know the violinist lives in house 1. 

From clue 2, we know the person with a computer lives to the left of the bird keeper. Since the violinist is in house 1, the person with a computer must be in house 1 as well, because there is no other house to the left of house 1.

Now, we know the person with a computer is in house 1, and the violinist is also in house 1. This means the person with a computer and the violinist are the same person, which is not possible according to the problem statement. However, this is not the case. The problem statement says each person has different characteristics, so the person in house 1 must be the violinist and the person in house 2 must be the computer user.

Now, we know the violinist is in house 1 and the computer user is in house 2. From clue 2, we know the person with a computer lives to the left of the bird keeper. This means the bird keeper must be in house 2, because the computer user is in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

From clue 4, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the first house.

From clue 20, the person who has a gameboy lives in the first house. Since the person in the first house has a rose bouquet (clue 4), the person in the first house is the gameboy owner.

From clue 10, the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who ate spaghetti lives in the fifth house.

From clue 12, the person who has a television lives in the third house. Since the person in the third house ate grilled cheese (from clue 2), the person in the third house is the television owner.

From clue 16, the person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other. Since the person in the second house is wearing boots (clue 1), the person in the second house cannot be the computer owner. The person in the second house must be wearing running shoes.

From clue 18, the person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the person in the first house has a gameboy (clue 20), the person in the first house cannot be the computer owner. The person in the first house has a rose bouquet (clue 4), so the person in the second house (wearing running shoes) must have a bouquet of daffodils.

From clue 16, the person in the second house (wearing running shoes) and the person in the third house (wearing computer) live directly next to each other. Since the person in the third house has a television (clue 12), the person in the third house is the computer owner.

From clue 2, the person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house, the person who is wearing high heels must live in the first house, but we already know the cat lover lives in the first house. This means the person who is wearing high heels must be the cat lover, which is not possible because the cat lover is in the first house and the person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner. This means the person who is wearing high heels must be the dog owner.

From clue 3, the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

Now we have the following information:
- The person who owns an SUV lives in the first house.
- The person who is wearing high heels (dog owner) lives in the second house.

The only person left is the person who is wearing running shoes.

"Let's follow the steps to find out who Dave is dancing with at the end of the dance.

1. At the start, Dave is dancing with Sam.

7. After the sixth switch, Gertrude and Fred switch partners, but this doesn't affect Dave.
8. After the seventh switch, Bob and Dave switch partners again, so Dave is now dancing with Helga again.

However, we need to consider the first switch where Eve and Fred switch partners. Since Eve was dancing with Karl and now she is dancing with Fred, and Eve and Alice switch partners, then Alice is now dancing with Eve's old partner, Karl. Eve is now dancing with Fred's old partner, Ophelia. 

So, after the first switch, Eve is dancing with Ophelia. After the third switch, Eve and Alice switch partners, so Eve is now dancing with Karl. After the fifth switch, Eve and Alice switch partners again, so Eve is now dancing with Ophelia again. 

After the seventh switch, Bob and Dave switch partners, but this doesn't change Dave's partner. However, we need to consider the second switch where Bob and Dave switch partners. After the second switch, Dave is dancing with Helga. After the fourth switch, Bob and Claire switch partners, so Bob is now dancing with Claire's old partner, Melissa. After the fifth switch, Eve and Alice switch partners, but this doesn't affect Dave. After the sixth switch, Gertrude and Fred switch partners, but this doesn't affect Dave. After the seventh switch, Bob and Dave switch partners, so Dave is now dancing with Melissa.
