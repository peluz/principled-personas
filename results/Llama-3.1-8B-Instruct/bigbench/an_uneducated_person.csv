"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the history book buff lives in the right house (house 2) and the convertible driver lives in the left house (house 1).

2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house. This means the person wearing boots lives in the second house (house 2).

Now, let's combine the information:

- The person in house 1 drives a convertible.
- The person in house 2 wears boots and is a history book buff.

Since the person in house 1 drives a convertible and lives left of the history book buff, the person in house 1 must be the one who drives a convertible. The person in house 2 must be the history book buff, and since they wear boots, the person in house 1 must be the one wearing sandals.

So, the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 1. The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
2. The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
3. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
4. The swimmer does not live in the third house.
5. The golfer lives in the first house.

From clue 5, we know the golfer lives in the first house. 

From clue 1, the swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the golfer is in the first house, the swimmer must be in the second house, and the romance book lover must be in the third house.

From clue 4, the swimmer does not live in the third house, but we already know the swimmer is in the second house, so this clue is not necessary for our solution.

From clue 3, the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff. Since the swimmer is in the second house, the mystery book reader must be in the first house, but we already know the golfer is in the first house, so the mystery book reader must be in the second house, and the history book buff must be in the third house.

Now we have:
- Golfer in the first house
- Mystery book reader in the second house
- Swim in the second house is incorrect, so the mystery book reader is in the second house, so the swimmer must be in the fourth house, and the romance book lover must be in the third house.

However, this creates a contradiction with clue 1, which states the swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means our previous assumption that the mystery book reader is in the second house is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the clues. From clue 5, the golfer lives in the first house. 

From clue 1, the swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the golfer is in the first house, the swimmer must be in the second house, and the romance book lover must be in the third house.

From clue 4, the swimmer does not live in the third house, but we already know the swimmer is in the second house, so this clue is not necessary for our solution.

From clue 3, the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff. Since the swimmer is in the second house, the mystery book reader must be in the first house, and the history book buff must be in the second house.

Now we have:
- Golfer in the first house
- History book buff in the second house
- Swim in the second house is incorrect, so the history book buff is in the second house, so the mystery book reader must be in the first house, and the swimmer must be in the third house, and the romance book lover must be in the fourth house.

However, this creates a contradiction with clue 2, which states the basketball player does not live in the fourth house. We don't know the basketball player's house yet, so let's keep going.

From clue 2, the basketball player does not live in the fourth house. Since the romance book lover is in the fourth house, the basketball player must be in the first, second, or third house.

We already know the golfer is in the first house, so the basketball player must be in the second or third house.

From clue 3, the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff. Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the history book buff must be in the second house.

From clue 1, the swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the swimmer is in the third house, the romance book lover must be in the fourth house.

Now we have:

3. There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
4. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From clue 5, we know the cat lover lives in the first house. 

From clue 1, the person with tulips lives to the left of the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in the first house, the dog owner must be in the second house (because the cat lover is already in the first house, and the tulip person is to the left of the dog owner).

From clue 2, the person with daffodils does not live in the second house, so they must live in either the first or the third house. But since the cat lover is in the first house, the person with daffodils must live in the third house.

From clue 3, there is one house between the person who owns horses and the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the dog owner is in the second house, the person with carnations must be in the fourth house (because there is one house between the horse owner and the carnations person, and the dog owner is already in the second house).

From clue 4, the person with lilies lives to the right of the horse owner. Since the dog owner is in the second house, the horse owner must be in the third house (because the person with lilies lives to the right of the horse owner, and the dog owner is already in the second house).

Now we have the following order: 
1. Cat lover
2. Dog owner
3. Horse owner
4. Carnations arrangement

The only person left is the fish enthusiast. Since the cat lover is in the first house, the dog owner is in the second house, the horse owner is in the third house, and the carnations person is in the fourth house, the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth house.

The answer is (D) 4."

From clue 3, we know the person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live directly next to each other. Since the person with a phone lives in house 1, the person with a radio must live in house 2, and the person with horses must live in house 1.

"Let's break down the clues to figure out the house number of the person who drives a truck.

From clue 9, we know the person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house.

From clue 8, we know the basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. 

From clue 7, we know the swimmer does not live in the first house. 

From clue 3, we know the swimmer lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. 

From clue 4, we know the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.

From clue 2, we know the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other.

From clue 5, we know the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.

From clue 6, we know the tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.

From clue 1, we know there is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the tennis player lives.

From clue 10, we know the root beer lover lives in the third house.

Now, let's try to put the information together:

- The person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house (clue 9).
- The basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck (clue 8).
- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement (clue 4).
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the right of the basketball player (clue 5).
- The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other (clue 2).

So, the order of the houses from left to right is: 
- Basketball player
- Person with a bouquet of daffodils
- Person with a bouquet of lilies
- Person with a carnations arrangement
- Person with a minivan

The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement, so the person who drives a truck must live in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."

From clue"
"Let's figure this out.

From clue 2, we know the person with a television lives in the first house. 

From clue 1, we know the person with a bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house. 

So, the person with a bouquet of lilies must live in the second house. 

Since the person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house, the person with a television (first house) must have a rose bouquet. 

Now, we know the first house has a television and a rose bouquet, and the second house has a bouquet of lilies. 

The only thing left is the computer. Since the first house has a television and a rose bouquet, the second house must have a computer. 

So, the person with a computer lives in the second house, which is answer (A)."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the golfer.
2. The person who had pizza and the history book buff live next to each other.
3. The guitarist lives to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.

From clue 2, we know that the person who had pizza and the history book buff live next to each other. Since the history book buff lives next to the science fiction book fanatic (from clue 1), the history book buff must live to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.

Now, let's combine this with clue 1: the science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the golfer, and the history book buff lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. This means the history book buff must live in house 1, and the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 2.

From clue 2, we know that the person who had pizza and the history book buff live next to each other. Since the history book buff lives in house 1, the person who had pizza must live in house 1 as well.

Now, let's look at clue 3: the guitarist lives to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils. Since the person with a bouquet of daffodils cannot live in house 1 (because the history book buff lives in house 1 and had pizza), the person with a bouquet of daffodils must live in house 2. This means the guitarist lives in house 3, but there is no house 3, so the guitarist must live in house 2 is incorrect. The person with a bouquet of daffodils must live in house 1, and the guitarist lives in house 2.

Now we have the following information:
- House 1: history book buff (pizza, daffodils)
- House 2: science fiction book fanatic (spaghetti, tulips)

The only remaining characteristics are the sport and the musical instrument. The person in house 1 is a history book buff and had pizza, and the person in house 2 is a science fiction book fanatic and had spaghetti. The person in house 1 must be the baseball player and the percussionist, and the person in house 2 must be the golfer and the guitarist.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's break down the clues to figure out the order of the houses.

From clue 8, the violinist lives in the fourth house. 

From clue 7, the person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy. Since the violinist lives in the fourth house, the person who has a gameboy must live in the fifth house (because the bird keeper lives in the fifth house, and the bird keeper is not the gameboy owner).

From clue 10, the bird keeper lives in the fifth house.

From clue 7, the person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy. Since the person who has a gameboy lives in the fifth house, the person who has a television lives in the fourth house. But we already know the violinist lives in the fourth house, so the person who has a television must be the violinist.

From clue 5, the person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio. Since the person who has a television lives in the fourth house, the person who has a radio must live in the fifth house. But we already know the person who has a gameboy lives in the fifth house, so the person who has a radio must be the gameboy owner.

From clue 1, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist. Since the person who has a gameboy lives in the fifth house, the guitarist must live in the fourth house. But we already know the violinist lives in the fourth house, so the guitarist must be the violinist, which is not possible. This means our previous assumption that the person who has a television lives in the fourth house is incorrect.

From clue 7, the person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy. Since the person who has a gameboy lives in the fifth house, the person who has a television must live in the fourth house is incorrect. The person who has a television must live in the third house.

From clue 5, the person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio. Since the person who has a television lives in the third house, the person who has a radio must live in the fourth house.

2. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
4. The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.

Now we have the following information:
- House 1: Baseball player, person who likes white, person who only drinks water
- House 2: Person who ate spaghetti, person who likes red, person who drinks milk

From clue 4, the person eating oranges doesn't live in the second house. That means the person eating oranges can live in house 1 or house 3.

From clue 2, the person drinking water lives to the right of the root beer lover. If the root beer lover lives in house 1, the person drinking water lives in house 3. If the root beer lover lives in house 3, the person drinking water lives in house 1.

If the root beer lover lives in house 1, the person eating oranges can't live in house 1 because the person drinking water lives in house 1. So the person eating oranges lives in house 3. But the person eating mangos can't live in house 3 because the person drinking water lives in house 1. So the person eating mangos lives in house 2. But the person eating mangos can't live in house 2 because the person drinking water lives in house 1. This is a problem.

If the root beer lover lives in house 3, the person eating oranges can live in house 1 or house 2. If the person eating oranges lives in house 1, the person drinking water lives in house 2. The person eating mangos can live in house 2. This works.

From clue 1, we know the person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, the person who ate pizza must live in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. We already know the first house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti. The second house is occupied by the person who ate pizza. So, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the third house.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

From clue 2, we know the dog owner does not live in the first house. 

From clue 1, we know the cellist lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy. This means the cellist lives in the first house and the person with the gameboy lives in the second house.

Now we have the following information:

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.
2. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
3. The soccer player lives in the third house.
4. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
5. The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.

From clue 3, we know the soccer player lives in the third house. 

From clue 1, the golfer lives directly left of the basketball player. This means the order of the houses is either: Golfer-Basketball-Soccer or Basketball-Golfer-Soccer.

From clue 2, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person with lilies.

From clue 4, the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

From clue 5, the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house, which means they live in either the first or second house.

Now, let's combine the information:

- The person with lilies lives left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives left of the person who ate spaghetti.
- The golfer lives left of the basketball player.

Considering the possible orders, if the order is Golfer-Basketball-Soccer, then the person with lilies would have to be in the first house, the person who ate grilled cheese in the second house, and the person who ate spaghetti in the third house. However, this would mean the person with tulips would have to be in the second house, but we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house, so this is not possible.

So, the order must be Basketball-Golfer-Soccer. 

Now, let's place the person with lilies, the person who ate grilled cheese, and the person who ate spaghetti. The person with lilies lives left of the person who ate grilled cheese, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the order is: Lilies-Grilled Cheese-Spaghetti.

Now, we know the person with tulips does not live in the third house, so they must live in the first house. The person with lilies lives in the first house, so the person with tulips must live in the second house.

The order is: Tulips-Lilies-Grilled Cheese-Spaghetti-Soccer.

The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the third house."

"Let's break down the clues one by one.

From clue 1, the tea drinker lives in the third house.

From clue 6, the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. Since the tea drinker lives in the third house, the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water must live in the second and fourth houses, in that order.

From clue 4, the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the third house. But this contradicts clue 1, which says the tea drinker lives in the third house. So, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house.

From clue 6, the person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house, and the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

From clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house. Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house, the person who lives in the first house must be the person who is wearing running shoes.

So, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house, which is house number 1."

"I don't know what them fancy words mean, but I'll try to figure it out. 

So, the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. That means the science fiction book fanatic lives to the left. Since there's only two houses, that means the science fiction book fanatic lives in the house on the left, which is house number 1."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The pianist lives in the first house.
2. The root beer lover lives to the right of the person who owns horses.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the pianist lives in house 1. 

From clue 3, we know the person who likes white does not live in house 2, so the person who likes white must live in house 1. But we already know the pianist lives in house 1, so the person who likes white must be the pianist. However, the pianist is in house 1, so the person who likes white is in house 1, which is a contradiction. This means the person who likes white must be in house 2.

Now we know the person who likes white lives in house 2. From clue 1, the pianist lives in house 1. From clue 3, the person who likes white lives in house 2. 

From clue 2, the root beer lover lives to the right of the person who owns horses. Since the person who likes white lives in house 2, the person who owns horses must live in house 1. The root beer lover lives to the right of the person who owns horses, so the root beer lover lives in house 2.

Now we have the following information:
- House 1: Pianist (owns horses, likes white)
- House 2: Root beer lover (owns dog, likes blue)

Since the person in house 1 owns horses and the person in house 2 owns a dog, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The percussionist lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. The person who had stew lives in the second house.
3. The guitarist lives to the left of the violinist.
4. The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
5. There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
6. The history book buff lives to the right of the percussionist.
7. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.

From clue 2, we know the person who had stew lives in the second house. 

From clue 7, we know the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.

From clue 1, we know the percussionist lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. 

From clue 4, we know the violinist does not live in the fourth house, so the violinist must live in either the first or the third house.

From clue 3, we know the guitarist lives to the left of the violinist. 

From clue 5, we know there are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives. 

From clue 6, we know the history book buff lives to the right of the percussionist.

Now, let's try to put the people in order:

- The person who had stew lives in the second house.
- The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
- The percussionist lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
- The history book buff lives to the right of the percussionist.
- The guitarist lives to the left of the violinist.

We can start by placing the person who had stew in the second house. 

The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house, so the person who had stew cannot be in the first house. 

The percussionist lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic, and the history book buff lives to the right of the percussionist. 

The guitarist lives to the left of the violinist, and the violinist cannot live in the fourth house.

Let's try to place the people in order:

1. The person who had fried rice (or the science fiction book fanatic) 
2. The person who had stew (history book buff)
3. The percussionist (fantasy book enthusiast)
4. The person who had pizza (romance book lover)

However, this order does not work because the history book buff lives to the right of the percussionist, but the person who had stew lives in the second house and the percussionist lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

Let's try another order:

1. The person who had fried rice (guitarist)
2. The person who had stew (history book buff)
3. The percussionist (science fiction book fanatic)
4. The person who had pizza (romance book lover)

This order works because the percussionist lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic, the history book buff lives to the right of the percussionist, and the guitarist lives to the left of the violinist.

The correct order is:

1. The person who had fried rice (guitarist)
2. The person who had stew (history book buff)
3. The percussionist (science fiction book fanatic)
4. The person who had pizza (romance book lover)

The percussionist lives in the third house."
"Let's break down the clues one by one.

From clue 1, the person who likes white lives in the first house.

From clue 4, the person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes white lives in the first house, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in the second house.

From clue 7, the person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house, the person who owns horses must also live in the second house.

From clue 6, the dog owner lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses. Since the person who owns horses lives in the second house, the dog owner must live in the third house.

From clue 8, the person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who owns horses lives in the second house, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the third house.

From clue 2, the person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house. Since the person who owns horses lives in the second house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house.

From clue 5, the person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the person who owns horses lives in the second house, the person who likes green must live in the first house, and the person who is wearing running shoes must live in the third house.

Now we have the following arrangement:

- House 1: person who likes green, wearing boots
- House 2: person who owns horses, has a bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: person who likes yellow, wearing running shoes, has a vase of tulips

However, we still need to figure out the favorite color of the person in the third house. From clue 3, the bird keeper does not live in the third house. Since the person in the third house has a vase of tulips, the person in the third house must be the bird keeper. The person in the third house must like yellow, as the person in the first house likes green and the person in the second house likes white.

So, the final arrangement is:

- House 1: person who likes green, wearing boots
- House 2: person who owns horses, has a bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: person who likes yellow, wearing running shoes, has a vase of tulips, is a bird keeper

The person who owns horses lives in the second house, so the answer is:

- The person with a computer and the person with tulips live next to each other.
- The tennis player lives to the left of the person with a television.
- The person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a television.

Now, let's try to place the person with a computer and the person with tulips. They live next to each other, and the person with a computer cannot be in the second house because the person with a rose bouquet is in the second house.

Since the person in house 1 is wearing high heels, the person in house 2 must be wearing sandals (because the other person is wearing high heels).

"I don't know how to read or write good. I'm gonna try to figure this out. 

From clue 7, we know the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. 

From clue 8, we know there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives. 

From clue 5, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white. 

From clue 1, we know the person who likes green does not live in the second house. 

From clue 2, we know the person who had stew does not live in the second house. 

From clue 3, we know the person who had stew does not live in the fourth house. 

From clue 6, we know the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew. 

From clue 4, we know the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

Now, let's try to figure out the order. 

If the person who likes green does not live in the second house, and the person who had stew does not live in the second house, then the person who likes green and the person who had stew must live in the first or the fourth house. 

If the person who likes green lives in the first house, then the person who had stew must live in the fourth house. But that's not possible because the person who had stew does not live in the fourth house. 

So, the person who likes green must live in the fourth house. 

The person who had stew must live in the first house. 

The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew. So, the person who likes red must live in the second house. 

The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. The person who likes blue cannot live in the first house because the person who had stew lives in the first house. The person who likes blue cannot live in the second house because the person who likes red lives in the second house. The person who likes blue must live in the third house. 

But wait, the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. So, the person who likes blue cannot live in the third house. 

The person who likes blue must live in the fifth house. 

The person who likes yellow lives one house to the right of the person who likes white. The person who likes yellow cannot live in the first house because the person who had stew lives in the first house. The person who likes yellow cannot live in the second house because the person who likes red lives in the second house. The person who likes yellow cannot live in the third house because the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. The person who likes yellow cannot live in the fourth house because the person who likes green lives in the fourth house. The person who likes yellow must live in the fifth house. But that's not possible because the person who likes blue lives in the fifth house. 

The person who likes yellow must live in the second house. 

The person who likes white lives one house to the left of the person who likes yellow. The person who likes white must live in the first house."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The violinist lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
2. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
3. The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.
4. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.
5. The percussionist lives in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the percussionist lives in the second house. 

From clue 4, we know the person who likes yellow does not live in the second house, so the person who likes yellow must live in either the first or third house.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes red lives in the third house. 

So, the person who likes yellow must live in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the violinist lives to the right of the basketball player. 

From clue 3, we know the basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player.

So, the order of the houses is: 
- First house: person who likes yellow
- Second house: percussionist
- Third house: person who likes red

Now, we need to figure out the order of the sports. 

Since the basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player, and the basketball player cannot live in the first house (because the person who likes yellow lives there), the basketball player must live in the third house. 

The only sport left is baseball, so the person who likes red (in the third house) must be the baseball player, and the basketball player must be in the third house.

The correct answer is (B) 3."

From clue 8, the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a computer. Since the person who has a computer does not live in the 5th house (clue 14), the person who drives a truck must live in the 3rd house.

"I don't know how to read or write good, but I'll try to figure it out.

From clue 1, the pianist and the person who eats kiwis live next to each other. That means they can be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3.

From clue 4, there is one house between the violinist and the person who eats kiwis. That means the violinist can't be in house 1, because then there would be no house between the violinist and the person who eats kiwis. So the violinist must be in house 2 or 3.

From clue 2, the flutist lives to the right of the violinist. If the violinist is in house 2, then the flutist must be in house 3. If the violinist is in house 3, then the flutist must be in house 3, but that's the same as the previous case, so the violinist must be in house 2.

So the violinist is in house 2, and the pianist and the person who eats kiwis are in houses 1 and 2. But from clue 1, the pianist and the person who eats kiwis live next to each other, so the pianist must be in house 1, and the person who eats kiwis must be in house 2.

"Let's figure this out.

Since the person with tulips lives in the second or third house, the person with loafers must live in the third or fourth house.

Now we have the following arrangement: 
- House 1: person with daffodils
- House 2: person with tulips
- House 3: person with loafers
- House 4: person with boots
- House 5: person with carnations

From clue 4, there is one house between where the person who is wearing running shoes lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.

But we already know the person with tulips lives in the second house, so the person with running shoes must live in the third house.

From clue 8, the person with daffodils and the person with running shoes live directly next to each other. This means the person with running shoes lives in the first house, and the person with daffodils lives in the second house.

Now we have the following arrangement: 
- House 1: person with running shoes
- House 2: person with daffodils
- House 3: person with loafers

"I don't know how to read or write good, but I'll try my best to figure it out.

From clue 2, we know the science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house. 

From clue 1, we know the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearing sandals. This means the person wearing sandals can't be in the first house, because the science fiction book fanatic is in the first house. So, the person wearing sandals must be in the second house.

Now, we know the person in the first house is the science fiction book fanatic, and the person in the second house is wearing sandals. The person in the first house can't be the coffee drinker, because the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearing sandals, and the person wearing sandals is in the second house. So, the person in the first house must be the water drinker.

The person in the second house is wearing sandals, and the person in the first house is the water drinker. The only one left is the coffee drinker and the romance book lover. The coffee drinker can't be in the second house, because the person in the second house is wearing sandals. So, the coffee drinker must be in the first house, but we already know the person in the first house is the water drinker. This is a problem.

Wait, I made a mistake. The person in the first house is the water drinker, and the person in the second house is wearing sandals. The person in the first house can't be the coffee drinker, because the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearing sandals. But the person in the first house is the water drinker, so the person in the first house can't be the coffee drinker. The person in the first house is the water drinker, and the person in the second house is wearing sandals. The person in the first house can't be the coffee drinker, so the person in the first house must be the romance book lover.

The answer is (A) 1."
I don't know what a pianist or percussionist is. Is it like a doctor?
"I don't know how to read or write good, but I'll try to figure it out.

From clue 1, the person who drives a convertible lives in the second house. 

From clue 3, the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. This means the person who likes yellow lives in the first house, and the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

So, the person who likes yellow lives in house 1."
"Let's break down the clues to figure out the house number of the person who owns horses.

From clue 1, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.

From clue 2, the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

From clue 3, the dog owner does not live in the third house.

From clue 5, there are two houses between where the person who is wearing running shoes lives and where the bird keeper lives. Since the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house, the bird keeper lives in the fourth or fifth house.

From clue 4, the person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper. This means the person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house.

From clue 10, the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the fifth house. This means the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second or third house. However, from clue 2, the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house, so the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.

From clue 9, the person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. This means the person who is wearing high heels lives in the first house, but we already know the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house. This is a contradiction, so the person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house is incorrect. The person who is wearing high heels must live in the first house, and the person who drives a truck lives in the second house.

From clue 13, the person who owns horses lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan. Since the person who drives a minivan lives in the first house, the person who owns horses lives in the third, fourth, or fifth house.

From clue 8, the fish enthusiast does not live in the third house. This means the fish enthusiast lives in the fourth or fifth house.

From clue 11, the fish enthusiast does not live in the fifth house. This means the fish enthusiast lives in the fourth house.

From clue 7, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. This means the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house.

From clue 13, the person who owns horses lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan. Since the person who drives a minivan lives in the first house, the person who owns horses lives in the third, fourth, or fifth house. However, the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house, so the person who owns horses lives in the fourth or fifth house.

From clue 6, the person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house. This means the person who is wearing high heels lives in the first house, and the person who owns horses lives in the fifth house.

The correct answer is (E) 5."

From clue 11, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. Since the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house, the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house, but we already know the bird keeper lives in the first house, so the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

"I don't know how to read or write good, but I'll try to figure it out.

From clue 3, the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house. Clue 4 says the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house. So, the person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book enthusiast must be the same person.

From clue 1, the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house.

From clue 2, the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first house.

Now, we know the first house has the science fiction book fanatic, the second house has the fantasy book enthusiast (who ate fried rice), and the third house must have the mystery book reader (who ate grilled cheese). So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"I don't know what ""foy-er"" means, but I think it's like a room in the house. And I don't know what ""tulips"" or ""carnations"" are, but I think they're like different kinds of flowers. And I don't know what ""dog"" or ""horses"" are, but I think they're like animals.

Okay, so there's two houses, one on the left and one on the right. And one person lives in each house. And one person has tulips and one person has carnations. And one person has a dog and one person has horses. And the person with carnations lives to the left of the person with a dog.

So, if the person with carnations lives to the left of the person with a dog, that means the person with carnations must live in the house on the left. And that's house number 1."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
3. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the person eating kiwis lives in the second house. Since the person in the second house is eating kiwis, the person in the first house must be eating grapes.

From clue 2, we know the person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person in the first house is eating grapes, the person in the first house must be wearing sandals (because the person in the second house is eating kiwis and cannot be wearing sandals).

Now we have the first house: person eating grapes, wearing sandals.

From clue 1, we know the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person in the first house is eating grapes and wearing sandals, the person in the first house cannot be the one who only drinks water. Therefore, the person who only drinks water must live in the second house.

Now we have the second house: person eating kiwis, drinking water.

The only remaining characteristic is the favorite color and the person wearing high heels. Since the person in the first house is eating grapes and wearing sandals, and the person in the second house is eating kiwis and drinking water, the person in the first house must like yellow (because the person in the second house is eating kiwis and cannot like yellow). The person in the second house must like green.

Now we have the first house: person eating grapes, wearing sandals, liking yellow.
Now we have the second house: person eating kiwis, drinking water, liking green.

The person wearing high heels must be in the first house, so the answer is:

(A) 1"
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who is wearing high heels lives to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
2. The person who is eating grapes and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
3. The tea drinker lives to the left of the person who has a television.

From clue 2, we know that the person who is eating grapes and the person who is wearing sandals live next to each other. Since the person who is wearing high heels lives to the left of the person who is wearing sandals (clue 1), the person who is eating grapes must be wearing high heels.

From clue 3, the tea drinker lives to the left of the person who has a television. Since the person who is eating grapes (high heels) and the person who is wearing sandals live next to each other, the person who is wearing sandals must be the one with the television (because the tea drinker lives to the left of the person with the television).

Now we have the following order: 
- House 1: person wearing high heels (eating grapes)
- House 2: person wearing sandals (has a television)

The only remaining characteristics are the phone and kiwis. Since the person in house 1 is eating grapes and the person in house 2 is wearing sandals, the person in house 1 must be eating kiwis (because the person in house 2 is eating grapes). The person in house 2 must have a phone (because the person in house 1 has a television).

So, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 1. The answer is (B) 1."

4. The violinist does not live in the third house.

From clue 3, we know the tea drinker lives in the first house.

From clue 2, there is one house between the violinist and the guitarist. Since the violinist lives in the second house, the guitarist must live in the third house.

So, the guitarist lives in the third house."

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
2. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the cat lover.
3. The mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.

From clue 3, we know the mystery book reader and the person who had stew live next to each other.

The person who has a carnations arrangement and the person who owns horses live next to each other, so the person who owns horses must be the fourth house.

The person who has a rose bouquet lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, so the person who has a rose bouquet must be the first house.

The person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be the second house.

From clue 3, the science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the percussionist. 

From clue 7, the guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist.

From clue 1, the percussionist lives directly left of the person who had stew.

So, the order of the people from left to right is: guitarist, science fiction book fanatic, percussionist, person who had stew.

From clue 4, there are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the saxophonist lives. This means the saxophonist lives in either the 4th or 5th house.

So, the saxophonist lives in the 4th house. The person who had pizza lives in the 2nd house (two houses between the person who had pizza and the saxophonist).

Now, let's place the people in the houses.

The person who had pizza lives in the 2nd house.

The mystery book reader lives directly left of the romance book lover, and there is one house between the mystery book reader and the history book buff. So, the mystery book reader lives in the 1st house, the romance book lover lives in the 3rd house, and the history book buff lives in the 5th house.

The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the mystery book reader, so the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the 3rd house. But we already know the romance book lover lives in the 3rd house, so the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the 4th house, which is the saxophonist's house. This contradicts clue 4.

So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the 1st house, the mystery book reader lives in the 2nd house, and the romance book lover lives in the 3rd house.

The person who had stew lives directly right of the percussionist, and the percussionist lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

The person who had spaghetti does not live in the third house, so the person who had spaghetti lives in the 5th house.

The person who ate fried rice lives in the 4th house, which is the saxophonist's house.

The fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the flutist. The flutist lives in the 5th house, so the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the 4th house, which is the saxophonist's house. But the person who ate fried rice lives in the 4th house, so the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the 3rd house, which is the romance book lover's house. But the romance book lover lives in the 3rd house, so the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the 2nd house, which is the mystery book reader's house. But the mystery book reader lives in the 2nd house, so the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the 1st house, which is the person who ate grilled cheese's house. But the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the 1st house, so the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the 2nd house, which is the person who had pizza's house. But the person who had pizza lives in the 2nd house, so the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the 3rd house, which is the romance book lover's house.

The person who ate fried rice lives in the 4th house, which is the saxophonist's house. The saxophonist lives in the 4th house, so the person who ate fried rice lives in the 4th house.

The person who had stew lives directly right of the percussionist, and the percussionist lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. The science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the percussionist, and the guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist. So, the order of the people from left to right is: guitarist, science fiction book fanatic, percussionist, person who had stew.

The person who had stew lives in the 5th house, which is the history book buff's house. But the history book buff lives in the 5th house, so the person who had stew lives in the 5th house.

The percussionist lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic, and the science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the percussionist. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had stew, and the person who had stew lives in the 5th house. So, the percussionist lives in the 4th house.

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The cellist lives to the left of the mystery book reader.
2. The history book buff lives to the left of the cat lover.
3. The root beer lover and the guitarist live next to each other.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover and the guitarist live next to each other. Since they live next to each other, one of them must live in house 1 and the other in house 2.

Now, let's look at clue 2: The history book buff lives to the left of the cat lover. This means the cat lover must live in house 2, because if the cat lover lived in house 1, the history book buff would have to live in house 0, which is not possible.

Now we have: 
- House 1: root beer lover and guitarist
- House 2: cat lover

From clue 1, the cellist lives to the left of the mystery book reader. This means the cellist must live in house 1, and the mystery book reader must live in house 2.

Now we have: 
- House 1: cellist and root beer lover
- House 2: mystery book reader and cat lover

From the remaining options, the person who owns horses must be the one who is not a cat lover, which is the person in house 1. The person in house 1 is the cellist and the root beer lover, but we don't know if the cellist or the root beer lover owns the horses. However, we can deduce that the person who owns horses is not the mystery book reader, because the mystery book reader lives in house 2. 

Since the cellist lives in house 1, the cellist must be the person who owns horses. 

The answer is (A) 1."
"I don't know how to read or write good, but I'll try to figure it out.

From clue 1, the person with carnations lives to the right of the bird keeper. That means the bird keeper can't be in house 3, 'cause then the carnations person would be in house 4, but there ain't no house 4.

From clue 2, the dog owner ain't in house 2. That means the dog owner is either in house 1 or house 3.

From clue 3, the tulips person lives to the right of the dog owner. That means if the dog owner is in house 1, the tulips person is in house 2. If the dog owner is in house 3, the tulips person is in house 3.

But if the dog owner is in house 3, then the bird keeper would be in house 1, and the carnations person would be in house 2. That's a problem, 'cause the carnations person lives to the right of the bird keeper, but they're in the same house.

So, the dog owner must be in house 1, the tulips person is in house 2, and the bird keeper is in house 3.

The answer is (B) 2."

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.
2. The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.
3. The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
4. The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.
5. The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.
6. The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.

From clue 1, the person eating mangos lives in house 1.

From clue 2, the person who owns horses does not live in house 1, so they must live in either house 2, 3, or 4.

From clue 3, the bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other. This means they must live in either houses 1 and 2, or houses 3 and 4.

From clue 4, the person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house. This means the person eating a banana must live in either house 1, 2, or 4.

From clue 5, the person who owns horses does not live in the second house. This means the person who owns horses must live in either house 3 or 4.

From clue 6, the person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner. This means the person eating a banana must live in house 2, and the dog owner must live in house 3.

Now we have the following information:
- House 1: person eating mangos
- House 2: person eating banana
- House 3: dog owner
- House 4: unknown

From clue 3, the bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other. Since the person eating a banana lives in house 2, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis must live in houses 1 and 3, or houses 3 and 4.

However, we know the dog owner lives in house 3. Therefore, the bird keeper must live in house 1, and the person eating kiwis must live in house 4.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
2. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house.
3. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.
4. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.

From clue 4, we know the mystery book reader lives in the first house. 

From clue 3, we know the bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the history book buff cannot live in the first house (because the mystery book reader is already there), so the history book buff must live in the second house. The bird keeper must live in the first house, but we already know the mystery book reader lives there, so this is a contradiction. However, if we re-examine clue 3, it says the bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff, not that the bird keeper lives in the first house. This means the bird keeper could live in the first house, but the history book buff must live in the second house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Bird keeper
- House 2: History book buff

From clue 2, we know the person who owns horses does not live in the third house. This means the person who owns horses must live in either the first or second house. However, we already know the bird keeper lives in the first house, so the person who owns horses must live in the second house. But we already know the history book buff lives in the second house, so this is a contradiction. However, if we re-examine clue 2, it says the person who owns horses does not live in the third house, not that the person who owns horses lives in the first or second house. This means the person who owns horses could live in the third house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Bird keeper
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Person who owns horses

From clue 1, we know the romance book lover does not live in the third house. This means the romance book lover must live in either the first or second house. However, we already know the bird keeper lives in the first house and the history book buff lives in the second house. Since the bird keeper is already in the first house, the romance book lover must live in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."

4. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
5. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
6. The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the coffee drinker lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the person who is eating apples must live in the first house, and the person who only drinks water must live in the second house. But we already know the coffee drinker lives in the second house, so this is a contradiction. We need to re-evaluate the clues.

From clue 1, we know the coffee drinker lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the person who is eating apples must live in the first house, and the person who only drinks water must live in the second house. But we already know the coffee drinker lives in the second house, so the person who only drinks water must live in the second house, and the person who is eating apples must live in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the person who is eating mangos does not live in the first house. Since the person who is eating apples lives in the first house, the person who is eating mangos must live in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house. This is already satisfied.

From clue 5, we know the person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. Since the person who is eating apples lives in the first house, the tea drinker must live in the third or fourth house.

From clue 6, we know the person who is eating kiwis does not live in the third house. Since the person who is eating mangos lives in the third house, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fourth house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Person eating apples
- House 2: Coffee drinker
- House 3: Person eating mangos
- House 4: Person eating kiwis

From clue 9, we know the person who likes white lives in the second house. 

From clue 1, the person who likes red lives directly right of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house, the person who likes red lives in the third house. However, we already know from clue 7 that the soccer player lives in the third house. This means the person who likes red is the soccer player.

"Let's break down the clues one by one.

From clue 8, the soccer player lives in the second house.

From clue 6, the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 1, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2.

From clue 7, the person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. Since the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 1, the person who had stew must live in house 3 (because the person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels, and the person who is wearing high heels must live in house 1).

From clue 5, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. This means the history book buff lives in house 3.

From clue 3, the golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 1, the golfer lives in house 3. But we already know the history book buff lives in house 3, so the golfer must live in house 2 is incorrect, and the history book buff must live in house 2 is also incorrect.

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
2. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.

From clue 1, we know the person eating grapes lives left of the person driving a truck. 

From clue 3, we know the person who likes yellow lives left of the person driving a truck. Since the person eating grapes lives left of the person driving a truck, the person who likes yellow must be the person eating grapes.

From clue 2, we know the person wearing boots lives left of the mystery book reader. Since the person eating grapes likes yellow, the person eating grapes cannot be the mystery book reader. Therefore, the person wearing boots must be the person eating grapes.

Now we have the person eating grapes (yellow) wearing boots. The person driving a truck must be the person eating oranges (since the person eating grapes likes yellow). 

The person wearing running shoes must be the mystery book reader (since the person wearing boots is eating grapes). The person driving a convertible must be the fantasy book enthusiast.

Since the person eating grapes (yellow) is wearing boots and lives left of the person driving a truck, the person eating grapes must live in house 1. The person driving a truck must live in house 2.

The person driving a convertible (fantasy book enthusiast) must live in house 2.

The answer is (B) 1."
