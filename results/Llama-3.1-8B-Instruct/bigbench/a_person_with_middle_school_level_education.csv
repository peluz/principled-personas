"Let's break down the clues:

1. The flutist lives in the second house.
2. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.
3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
4. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.

From clue 1, we know the flutist lives in the second house. 

From clue 4, there is one house between the flutist and the pianist. This means the pianist lives in either the third or the fourth house. 

If the pianist lives in the fourth house, then the flutist would be in the second house and the pianist would be in the fourth house, which would leave the first and third houses for the guitarist and the person with a vase of tulips or the person with a bouquet of lilies and the person with a carnations arrangement. However, from clue 2, the person with a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist. This would mean the guitarist would be in the third house, and the person with a vase of tulips would be in the first house. But this would contradict clue 3, which says the person with a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person with a carnations arrangement. 

So, the pianist must live in the third house. 

From clue 2, the person with a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist. Since the guitarist lives in the third house, the person with a vase of tulips must live in the second house. But we already know the flutist lives in the second house. This is a contradiction.

However, if the pianist lives in the third house, then the flutist lives in the second house, and the person with a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist. This means the person with a vase of tulips must live in the first house."

From clue 3, the person who only drinks water lives to the left of the root beer lover. Since the person who likes green lives in the first house, the person who only drinks water must live in the first house. The person who is eating kiwis also lives in the first house, so the person who only drinks water must be the person who is eating kiwis. 

From clue 1, the root beer lover lives to the left of the person who is eating grapes. Since the person who is eating kiwis (and only drinks water) lives in the first house, the person who is eating grapes must live in the second house. The person who likes blue lives in the second house (from clue 6), so the person who is eating grapes must be the person who likes blue.

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the history book buff lives in the right house (house 2) and the convertible driver lives in the left house (house 1).

2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house. This means the person wearing boots lives in the second house (house 2).

Now, let's combine the information:

- The person in house 1 drives a convertible.
- The person in house 2 wears boots and is a history book buff.

Since the person in house 1 drives a convertible and lives left of the history book buff, the person in house 1 must be the one who drives a convertible. The person in house 2 is the history book buff and wears boots.

The only remaining characteristic is the type of shoes the person in house 1 wears. Since the person in house 2 wears boots, the person in house 1 must wear sandals.

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
2. The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
3. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
4. The swimmer does not live in the third house.
5. The golfer lives in the first house.

From clue 5, we know the golfer lives in the first house. 

From clue 1, the swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the golfer is in the first house, the swimmer must be in the second house, and the romance book lover must be in the third house.

From clue 4, the swimmer does not live in the third house, but we already know the swimmer is in the second house, so this clue is not necessary for our solution.

From clue 3, the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff. Since the swimmer is in the second house, the mystery book reader must be in the first house, but we already know the golfer is in the first house, so this is a contradiction. However, we can try another arrangement. If the mystery book reader is in the first house, then the history book buff must be in the second house. But we already know the swimmer is in the second house, so this is also a contradiction. 

However, if the mystery book reader is in the second house, then the history book buff must be in the third house. This is possible because the swimmer is in the second house, and the romance book lover is in the third house. 

From clue 2, the basketball player does not live in the fourth house. Since the romance book lover is in the third house, the basketball player must be in the fourth house or the first house. But we already know the golfer is in the first house, so the basketball player must be in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (C) 4."
"To solve this, let's break down the clues:

1. The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the second house.
2. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.
3. The mystery book reader lives in the third house.
4. The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
5. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the romance book lover.

From clue 3, we know the mystery book reader lives in the third house.

From clue 5, we know the person wearing sandals lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since there are only 4 houses, the person wearing sandals must live in the first house, and the romance book lover must live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing high heels does not live in the second house, so they must live in either the first or the fourth house. But from clue 4, we know they cannot live in the fourth house, so they must live in the first house.

Now we have a problem: the person wearing sandals lives in the first house, and the person wearing high heels lives in the first house. This is a contradiction. However, we can resolve this by re-examining clue 5. It says the person wearing sandals lives directly left of the romance book lover, but it doesn't say they live in the same house. So, the person wearing sandals can live in the first house, and the romance book lover can live in the second house.

Now, let's re-examine clue 2. It says the history book buff lives to the right of the person wearing loafers. Since the person wearing loafers cannot live in the first or second house (because the person wearing sandals lives in the first house and the romance book lover lives in the second house), they must live in the third or fourth house. But the mystery book reader lives in the third house, so the person wearing loafers must live in the fourth house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: person wearing sandals
- House 2: romance book lover
- House 3: mystery book reader
- House 4: person wearing loafers

The correct answer is (D) 3."

3. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.
Since the person who likes green lives in house 1 and the person who has a gameboy lives in house 2, the person who likes yellow must live in house 3.

So, the order is: 
- House 1: person who likes green
- House 2: person who has a gameboy
- House 3: person who likes yellow and has a computer

The answer is (C) 3."

4. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From clue 5, we know the cat lover lives in the first house. 

From clue 1, the person with tulips lives to the left of the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in the first house, the dog owner must be in the second house (because the cat lover is already in the first house, and the tulip person is to the left of the dog owner).

From clue 2, the person with daffodils does not live in the second house, so they must live in either the first or the third or the fourth house.

From clue 3, there is one house between the horse owner and the carnations person. This means the horse owner and the carnations person cannot be in the first and second houses (because there would be no house in between), and they cannot be in the third and fourth houses (because there would be two houses in between). So, the horse owner and the carnations person must be in the second and fourth houses.

From clue 4, the person with lilies lives to the right of the horse owner. Since the horse owner is in the second house, the person with lilies must be in the third house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Horse owner
- House 3: Person with lilies
- House 4: Carnations person

The only person left is the fish enthusiast. Since the cat lover is in the first house, the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth house.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who has a phone lives in the first house.
2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
3. The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live directly next to each other.

From clue 1, we know the person with a phone lives in house 1. 

From clue 2, we know the person with boots does not live in house 2, so they must live in house 1. But we already know the person in house 1 has a phone, so the person in house 1 cannot be wearing boots. This means the person in house 1 must be wearing high heels.

From clue 3, we know the person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live directly next to each other. Since the person in house 1 is wearing high heels, the person in house 2 must be wearing boots. 

So, the person in house 1 is wearing high heels, and the person in house 2 is wearing boots. 

The answer is (B) 1."

But we already found that the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house. This means the person who drives a convertible must be the person who owns a sedan.

However, this contradicts the information given in the problem that each person has a different kind of car. Therefore, the person who owns a sedan cannot be the person who likes red and drives a convertible. This means the person who owns a sedan must live in a different house.

From clue 13, the person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in the second house, the person who owns a sedan must live in the second house.

"To find the house number of the cellist, we need to analyze the clues.

From clue 10, the tea drinker lives in the fourth house. 

From clue 5, the cellist lives directly left of the tea drinker. 

So, the cellist must live in the third house because the cellist cannot live in the first house (because the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers, and the person who only drinks water cannot live in the fourth house as the tea drinker lives there) and the cellist cannot live in the fourth house as the tea drinker lives there.

This means the person who likes white lives in the second house, and the person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.

Now, we know the person who owns an SUV lives in the first house (from clue 2), and the person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house. This means the person who owns an SUV is also the person who is wearing loafers.

From clue 1, the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house. We also know the person who likes white lives in the second house. This means the person who ate fried rice is not the person who likes white. 

The only person left in the second house is the person who ate fried rice and the person who likes green. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house, the person who likes green must live in the first house.

The person who owns a sedan must be the person who ate spaghetti because the person who owns an SUV is wearing loafers. The person who ate spaghetti must be the person who owns a sedan.

"Let's break down the clues to find the solution.

From clue 8, the violinist lives in the fourth house. 

From clue 7, the person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy. Since the violinist lives in the fourth house, the person who has a gameboy must live in the fifth house (because the bird keeper lives in the fifth house, and the bird keeper is not the gameboy owner).

From clue 10, the bird keeper lives in the fifth house.

From clue 7, the person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy. Since the person who has a gameboy lives in the fifth house, the person who has a television lives in the fourth house. But we already know the violinist lives in the fourth house, so the person who has a television must be the violinist.

From clue 5, the person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio. Since the person who has a television lives in the fourth house, the person who has a radio must live in the fifth house. But we already know the person who has a gameboy lives in the fifth house, so the person who has a radio must be the gameboy owner.

From clue 1, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist. Since the person who has a gameboy lives in the fifth house, the guitarist must live in the fourth house. But we already know the violinist lives in the fourth house, so the guitarist must live in the third house.

From clue 6, the guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist. Since the guitarist lives in the third house, the percussionist must live in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who has a radio lives to the right of the person who is eating apples.
2. The person who has a radio lives to the right of the violinist.
3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
4. The basketball player does not live in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the person with lilies lives in house 1. 

From clue 4, the basketball player lives in house 2.

From clue 1, the person with a radio lives to the right of the person eating apples. Since the basketball player lives in house 2, the person eating apples must live in house 1. 

From clue 2, the person with a radio lives to the right of the violinist. Since the person with lilies lives in house 1, the violinist must live in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The tennis player lives in the third house.
2. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
3. The golfer lives in the fourth house.
4. There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.
5. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.

From clue 1, we know the tennis player lives in the third house. 

From clue 7, the soccer player lives to the right of the tennis player, so the soccer player lives in the fourth or fifth house. But from clue 3, the golfer lives in the fourth house, so the soccer player must live in the fifth house. 

From clue 2, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house, which means the soccer player eats grilled cheese. 

From clue 4, there is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives. Since the fifth house is taken by the soccer player, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the second house, and the person who ate fried rice must live in the first house.

From clue 6, the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti, so the person who had stew lives in the first house, and the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.

From clue 5, the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the first house is taken by the person who had stew, the person who had pizza must live in the second house, but we already know the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house. So, the person who had pizza must live in the first house, and the person who had stew must live in the third house.

However, we already know the tennis player lives in the third house. So, the person who had stew must live in the second house, and the person who had pizza must live in the first house.

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
2. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
4. The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who likes white lives in house 1 and the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2.

From clue 3, the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the baseball player must live in house 2 as well.

From clue 4, the person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the person who only drinks water must live in house 2 as well.

Now we have: 
- House 1: person who likes white
- House 2: baseball player, person who ate spaghetti, person who only drinks water

From clue 1, the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house. This means the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 2. But we already know that house 2 is occupied by three people. This is a contradiction.

However, we can re-examine the clues. Clue 1 says the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house. This means the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 2. But we also know that the person who likes white lives in house 1 and the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2. This means the person who is wearing running shoes must live in house 1.

Now we have: 
- House 1: person who likes white, person who is wearing running shoes
- House 2: baseball player, person who ate spaghetti, person who only drinks water

From clue 3, the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. This is already true since they live in the same house.

From clue 4, the person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. This is also true since they live in the same house.

From clue 2, the person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This is true since the person who likes white lives in house 1 and the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2.

Now we have: 
- House 1: person who likes white, person who is wearing running shoes
- House 2: baseball player, person who ate spaghetti, person who only drinks water

The person who is wearing loafers must live in house 2. The correct answer is (A) 2."

3. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
4. The person eating oranges does not live in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover is not in the second house. This means the root beer lover can be in either the first or the third house.

From clue 4, we know the person eating oranges is not in the second house. This means the person eating oranges can be in either the first or the third house.

From clue 1, we know the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person eating mangos. This means the person eating mangos can be in either the second or the third house.

Now, let's combine the information:

- The root beer lover can be in either the first or the third house.
- The person eating oranges can be in either the first or the third house.
- The person eating mangos can be in either the second or the third house.

If the root beer lover is in the first house, the person eating oranges can't be in the first house (because the person eating oranges can't be in the second house, and the person eating mangos can't be in the first house because the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person eating mangos). This means the person eating oranges must be in the third house. But this would mean the person eating mangos is in the second house, which is not possible because the person eating mangos can't be in the second house (clue 1). So, the root beer lover can't be in the first house.

This means the root beer lover must be in the third house."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house.
2. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
3. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
4. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. 

From clue 2, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. This means the person who ate fried rice cannot live in the first house because the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. So, the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.

From clue 1, the person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, the person who ate pizza must live in the second house.

From clue 4, the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. We already know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, so the person who is wearing loafers must live in either the second or the third house.

Since the person who ate pizza lives in the second house, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

"Let's break down the clues to find the house number where the person who had pizza lives.

From clue 1, the person who likes green lives in the first house.

From clue 2, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes blue.

From clue 12, the person who likes blue and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes green lives in the first house, the person who likes blue must live in the second house, and the person who owns an SUV must live in the second house as well.

From clue 13, the person who had pizza and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes blue lives in the second house, the person who had pizza must live in the first house, and the person who is eating apples must live in the second house.

However, this contradicts clue 6, which states that the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the person who had pizza lives in the first house, then the person who is eating mangos must live in the first house, and the person who likes red must live in the second house. But this contradicts clue 10, which states that the person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.

Let's re-examine the clues. From clue 11, the person who had pizza and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes blue lives in the second house, the person who had pizza must live in the second house, and the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the third house.

From clue 13, the person who had pizza and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other. Since the person who had pizza lives in the second house, the person who is eating apples must live in the third house.

From clue 9, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who had pizza. Since the person who had pizza lives in the second house, the person who is eating mangos must live in the first house.

From clue 6, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes red. Since the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house, the person who likes red must live in the second house.

From clue 10, the person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes. Since the person who likes red lives in the second house, the person who is eating grapes must live in the third house.

From clue 8, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan. Since the person who is eating grapes lives in the third house, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the fourth house.

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who has a radio and the person who drives a truck live directly next to each other.
2. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
3. The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
4. The root beer lover does not live in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the person with a radio and the person with a truck live next to each other. 

From clue 2, we know the person with a radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza.

From clue 3, we know the person eating grapes lives to the left of the person with a computer.

From clue 4, we know the root beer lover does not live in the first house.

Let's combine the information:

- The person with a radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza.
- The person with a radio and the person with a truck live next to each other.
- The person eating grapes lives to the left of the person with a computer.

Possible combinations:
- House 1: Radio, Truck, Grapes, Computer
- House 2: Pizza, Water, Banana, Minivan

However, the root beer lover does not live in the first house, so the person in the first house must be eating grapes and the person in the second house must be eating bananas.

Now, we know the person with a computer lives to the right of the person eating grapes. Since the person eating grapes lives in the first house, the person with a computer must live in the second house.

The person with a radio and the person with a truck live next to each other. Since the person with a computer lives in the second house, the person with a radio and the person with a truck must live in the first house.

The person with a radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza. Since the person with a radio lives in the first house, the person who had pizza must live in the second house.

The answer is (B) 1."

From clue 1, the tea drinker lives in the first house. From clue 5, the person who had pizza lives in the second house.

From clue 4, the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live next to each other, they must be in the second and third houses, or the third and fourth houses. But from clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who only drinks water. So, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first house, which is already occupied by the tea drinker. This is a contradiction, so the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water must live in the third and fourth houses.

From clue 2, the person who likes milk lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in the first house, the person who likes milk must be in the second house.

From clue 3, the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow cannot be in the first house (because the tea drinker is there), the person who likes yellow must be in the third or fourth house. But from clue 4, the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live in the third and fourth houses. So, the person who likes yellow must be in the third house, and the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house.

From clue 7, the person who likes green does not live in the first house. From clue 8, the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house. The only remaining house is the second house, so the person who likes green must live in the second house.

The correct answer is (D) 2."

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The romance book lover lives to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
2. There is one house between the history book buff and the guitarist.
3. There is one house between the percussionist and the mystery book reader.
4. The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.
5. The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
6. The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other.
7. The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.

From clue 7, we know the saxophonist lives in the fourth house. Since the saxophonist and the violinist live next to each other, the violinist must live in either the third or the fifth house.

From clue 5, we know the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house. Since there is one house between the percussionist and the mystery book reader (clue 3), the percussionist must live in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the percussionist lives in the second house, the romance book lover must live in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the romance book lover lives to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the romance book lover lives in the third house, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the fourth or fifth house. However, we already know the saxophonist lives in the fourth house (clue 7), so the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the fifth house.

From clue 2, we know there is one house between the history book buff and the guitarist. Since the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house, the history book buff and the guitarist must live in the first and second houses, or the first and third houses. However, we already know the percussionist lives in the second house (clue 4), so the history book buff must live in the first house, and the guitarist must live in the third house.

Now we have the following order: 1 (history book buff), 2 (percussionist), 3 (romance book lover), 4 (saxophonist), 5 (fantasy book enthusiast).

However, we still need to determine the instrument of the romance book lover and the history book buff. We know the percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover (clue 4), so the percussionist must live in the second house, and the romance book lover must live in the third house. We also know the saxophonist and the violinist live next to each other (clue 6), and the saxophonist lives in the fourth house (clue 7), so the violinist must live in the fifth house.

Now we have the following order: 1 (history book buff), 2 (percussionist), 3 (romance book lover), 4 (saxophonist), 5 (fantasy book enthusiast).

We still need to determine the instrument of the history book buff. We know the saxophonist and the violinist live next to each other (clue 6), and the saxophonist lives in the fourth house (clue 7), so the violinist must live in the fifth house. We also know the percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover (clue 4), so the percussionist must live in the second house, and the romance book lover must live in the third house. We also know the history book buff lives in the first house (clue 2), so the history book buff must be the cellist.

Now we have the following order: 1 (history book buff, cellist), 2 (percussionist), 3 (romance book lover), 4 (saxophonist), 5 (fantasy book enthusiast, violinist).

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.
2. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.
3. The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.
5. There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.

From clue 4, we know the person wearing boots lives to the left of the person wearing loafers. Since the person wearing loafers lives in the second house, the person wearing boots must live in the first house.

From clue 2, the person wearing loafers lives in the second house. 

From clue 1, the person with a television lives in the fourth house.

From clue 5, there are two houses between the person with a radio and the person wearing sandals. Since the person wearing boots is in the first house and the person wearing loafers is in the second house, the person wearing sandals must be in the fourth house (because there are two houses between the person with a radio and the person wearing sandals, and the person with a television is in the fourth house).

So, the order of the houses is: 1 (boots), 2 (loafers), ?, ?, 4 (television and sandals).

The only device left is the gameboy, and the only remaining house is the third house. 

The answer is (B) 3."
"From clue 5, we know the person wearing running shoes lives in the third house. 

From clue 2, we know the coffee drinker does not live in the second house. 

From clue 4, we know the coffee drinker does not live in the first house. 

So, the coffee drinker must live in the third house, but we already know the person in the third house is wearing running shoes. This means the person in the third house is the coffee drinker and the person wearing running shoes.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing high heels lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing loafers does not live in house 1. This means the person wearing loafers must live in house 2.

From clue 2, we know the mystery book reader does not live in house 2. This means the mystery book reader must live in house 1.

Now, we know the person in house 1 is a mystery book reader and the person in house 2 is wearing loafers. The only option left is that the person in house 2 is the history book buff and the person in house 1 is the mystery book reader.

So, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 2. The answer is (B)."
"Let's break down the clues to find the house number of the person who had pizza.

From clue 2, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.

From clue 9, the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.

From clue 1, the person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.

From clue 6, the person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who had stew.

From clue 8, the person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.

From clue 3, the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the third house.

From clue 5, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.

From clue 4, the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who had pizza.

From clue 7, the person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

From clue 10, the person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

Now, let's combine the information:

- The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who had stew (clue 6).
- The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other (clue 1).
- The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the third house (clue 3).
- The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other (clue 8).

Since the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the third house, the person who is wearing running shoes must live in either the first or the fourth house.

If the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house, then the person who has a gameboy lives in the second house. But then, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the third house (from clue 4), and the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house (from clue 2). However, this contradicts clue 9, which states that the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.

Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes must live in the fourth house. The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.

Now, let's look at the remaining clues:

- The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals (clue 2).
- The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza (clue 9).
- The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who had pizza (clue 4).

Since the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house, the person who had pizza must live in the third house."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person with a rose bouquet lives to the left of the person with a bouquet of lilies.
2. The saxophonist does not live in the first house.
3. The person eating mangos lives in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the person eating mangos lives in the first house. Since the person eating mangos lives in the first house, the person eating apples must live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the person with a rose bouquet lives to the left of the person with a bouquet of lilies. Since the person eating mangos lives in the first house, the person with a rose bouquet must live in the first house, and the person with a bouquet of lilies must live in the second house.

Now, we know the person eating apples lives in the second house, and the person with a bouquet of lilies also lives in the second house. This means the person eating apples and the person with a bouquet of lilies are the same person.

So, the person eating apples lives in the second house, which is answer (B)."
"To find the house number of the coffee drinker, we need to analyze the clues.

From clue 5, the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person with tulips does not live in the third house.
2. The person with lilies lives to the right of the person with an SUV.
3. The person with a sedan and the person with a rose bouquet live next to each other.
4. The person with a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the person with a rose bouquet cannot live in the second house. This means they must live in either the first or third house.

From clue 3, we know the person with a sedan and the person with a rose bouquet live next to each other. Since the person with a rose bouquet cannot live in the second house, they must live in the first or third house. This means the person with a sedan must live in the second house.

Now we have the following arrangement so far:
- House 1: unknown
- House 2: sedan
- House 3: unknown

From clue 2, we know the person with lilies lives to the right of the person with an SUV. Since the person with a sedan lives in the second house, the person with an SUV must live in the first house. This means the person with lilies lives in the third house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: sedan
- House 3: lilies

From clue 1, we know the person with tulips does not live in the third house. This means the person with tulips must live in the first or second house. However, the first house is occupied by the person with an SUV, so the person with tulips must live in the second house. But we already know the second house is occupied by the person with a sedan. This is a contradiction, so our initial assumption that the person with a sedan lives in the second house must be incorrect.

Let's re-examine the clues. From clue 3, we know the person with a sedan and the person with a rose bouquet live next to each other. Since the person with a rose bouquet cannot live in the second house, they must live in the first or third house. This means the person with a sedan must live in the first or third house.

From clue 2, we know the person with lilies lives to the right of the person with an SUV. This means the person with an SUV cannot live in the third house, so the person with an SUV must live in the first house. This means the person with a sedan lives in the third house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: unknown
- House 3: sedan

From clue 3, we know the person with a sedan and the person with a rose bouquet live next to each other. Since the person with a sedan lives in the third house, the person with a rose bouquet must live in the second house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: rose bouquet
- House 3: sedan

From clue 1, we know the person with tulips does not live in the third house. This means the person with tulips must live in the first or second house. However, the first house is occupied by the person with an SUV, so the person with tulips must live in the second house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: tulips
- House 3: sedan

The person who drives a truck is not mentioned in the clues, but we can deduce that the person who drives a truck must live in the third house, since the other two houses are occupied by the person with an SUV and the person with tulips.

The answer is (C) 3."

The answer is (B) 3."

From clue 5, the person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the second house, the person who had stew must live in the first house, and the romance book lover must live in the third house.

From clue 3, the fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew lives in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the third house. But we already know the romance book lover lives in the third house. This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the romance book lover are the same person.

From clue 4, the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the second house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first house.

Now we have the following information:
- The person who likes green lives in the third house.
- The person who likes yellow lives in the second house.
- The person who had stew lives in the first house.
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.
- The fantasy book enthusiast and the romance book lover live in the third house.

Since the person who had stew lives in the first house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first house. This means the person who had stew and the person who ate grilled cheese are the same person.

Now we have the following information:
- The person who likes green lives in the third house.
- The person who likes yellow lives in the second house.
- The person who had stew and the person who ate grilled cheese live in the first house.

The only person left is the person who likes blue. Since the person who likes green lives in the third house, the person who likes blue must live in the first house.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Let's break down the clues to find the solution.

From clue 7, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.

From clue 1, the person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other. Since the person with carnations lives in the first house, the person with tulips and the bird keeper must live in the second and third houses, respectively.

From clue 6, the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other. Since the person with tulips and the bird keeper live in the second and third houses, the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue must live in the second and third houses as well. However, the person who likes yellow lives in the third house (clue 4), so the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue must live in the second house.

From clue 6, the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other, so the person who owns horses must like blue. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house, so the person who likes blue lives in the second house.

From clue 3, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. Since the person who owns horses lives in the second house, the person who owns a sedan must live in the first house.

From clue 2, there is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who drives a truck lives. Since the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house, the percussionist must live in the second house, and the person who drives a truck must live in the third house.

From clue 8, the cellist does not live in the third house. Since the person who drives a truck lives in the third house, the cellist must live in the first house.

From clue 5, there is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives. Since the person who owns horses lives in the second house, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the third house.

From clue 1, the person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other. Since the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the third house, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the second house, and the bird keeper must live in the third house.

The final answer is (C) 3."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
2. The cellist lives in the first house.
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

From clue 1 and 2, we know the person in house 1 is the fantasy book enthusiast and the cellist. 

From clue 3, we know the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person in house 1 is the cellist (and fantasy book enthusiast), the person in house 2 must be the pianist (since the pianist is the only other instrument left). 

Now, we know the person in house 1 is the cellist and fantasy book enthusiast, and the person in house 2 is the pianist. 

Since the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes red, and the person in house 1 is the cellist (fantasy book enthusiast), the person in house 1 must like green (because the person in house 2 likes red). 

So, the person in house 1 is the cellist who likes green, and the person in house 2 is the pianist who likes red. 

The only book left is the mystery book, so the person in house 2 (the pianist) must be the mystery book reader.

The answer is (B) 2."

3. The history book buff lives in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the history book buff lives in the first house.

This means the swimmer cannot live in House 1 (because there would be no house between them and the science fiction book fanatic), and the swimmer cannot live in House 3 (because there would be two houses between them and the science fiction book fanatic).

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
2. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing sandals lives to the left of the person who owns horses. This means the person who owns horses lives in house 2 (since house 1 is on the left).

From clue 2, we know the history book buff lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in house 2 (since the history book buff lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who owns horses lives in house 2). So, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 1.

Now, we know the person who owns horses lives in house 2, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 1. The person who wears sandals lives to the left of the person who owns horses, so the person who wears sandals lives in house 1. But we already know the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 1, so the person who wears sandals must be the person who ate spaghetti. This is a contradiction.

However, we can still solve this puzzle by using the process of elimination. The person who wears sandals lives to the left of the person who owns horses, so the person who owns horses lives in house 2. The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the history book buff, so the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 1. The person who wears sandals lives to the left of the person who owns horses, so the person who wears sandals lives in house 1. But we already know the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 1, so the person who wears sandals must be the person who ate spaghetti. This is a contradiction.

However, we can still solve this puzzle by using the process of elimination. The person who wears sandals lives to the left of the person who owns horses, so the person who owns horses lives in house 2. The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the history book buff, so the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 1. The person who wears sandals lives to the left of the person who owns horses, so the person who wears sandals lives in house 1. The person who ate fried rice lives in the other house, which is house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. This means the person with the sedan lives in house 1, and the person with the lilies lives in house 2.

2. The flutist does not live in the first house. This means the flutist lives in house 2.

Now, we know the person in house 2 has a bouquet of lilies and is a flutist. The person in house 1 has a sedan. The person in house 2 cannot be a saxophonist because the person in house 1 has a sedan and the person in house 2 has lilies, so the person in house 1 must be the saxophonist.

So, the person with a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2. The answer is (B)."

From clue 3, we know the basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the first house, the tennis player must live in the second house (because the percussionist lives in the second house).

Now, we have the order: 1 (yellow), 2 (tennis), 3 (red).

From clue 1, we know the violinist lives to the right of the basketball player. Since the person who likes red lives in the third house, the basketball player must live in the second house (because the tennis player lives in the second house).

So, the pianist lives in house 1 and the cellist lives in house 2. But we already know the root beer lover lives in house 1. Therefore, the root beer lover lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From clue 3 and 4, we know the person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book enthusiast both live in the second house. Since they can't be the same person (they have different lunch), this means the person who ate fried rice is not the fantasy book enthusiast.

From clue 1, the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house.

4. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
5. The person who owns horses lives in the third house.
6. The person who is eating mangos and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other.

From clue 1, the person who is eating oranges lives in the first house.

From clue 5, the person who owns horses lives in the third house.

From clue 6, the person who is eating mangos and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other. Since the person who owns horses lives in the third house, the person who is eating mangos and the person who drives a convertible must live in the first and second houses.

From clue 2, the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible. This means the person who drives a truck must live in the first house, and the person who drives a convertible must live in the second house.

So, the order of the houses is:
- House 1: The person who drives a truck and is eating mangos.
- House 2: The person who drives a convertible and is eating bananas.
- House 3: The person who owns horses and is eating oranges.

The person who drives a truck lives in the first house, which is house number 1."
"Let's break down the clues to find the house number of the percussionist.

From clue 1, the percussionist lives directly left of the person who had stew. 

From clue 3, the science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. 

From clue 7, the guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist.

From clue 10, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the third house. 

Combining these clues, the guitarist, percussionist, and the person who had stew must be in houses 1, 2, and 3 in some order. 

From clue 3, the science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the percussionist. This means the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1, the guitarist in house 2, and the percussionist in house 3.

From clue 1, the person who had stew lives to the right of the percussionist. This means the person who had stew must be in house 4.

From clue 8, the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the mystery book reader. 

From clue 5, the mystery book reader lives directly left of the romance book lover. 

From clue 9, there is one house between the mystery book reader and the history book buff. 

From clue 4, there are two houses between the person who had pizza and the saxophonist. 

From clue 6, the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the flutist.

From clue 2, the percussionist lives to the right of the mystery book reader. 

Combining these clues, the mystery book reader must be in house 2, the romance book lover in house 3, the history book buff in house 4, and the person who ate grilled cheese in house 5.

The person who had pizza must be in house 1, the saxophonist in house 5, and the flutist in house 4.

The person who ate fried rice must be in house 5, but the person who ate fried rice is not in house 5. This means the person who ate fried rice must be in house 1.

The person who ate fried rice is in house 1, the person who had pizza is in house 1, and the science fiction book fanatic is in house 1. This is a contradiction, so the person who ate fried rice must be in house 2, the person who had pizza in house 3, the saxophonist in house 5, and the flutist in house 4.

The person who ate fried rice is in house 2, the science fiction book fanatic is in house 1, the guitarist is in house 2, the percussionist is in house 3, and the person who had stew is in house 4.

The correct answer is (A) 3."

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The cellist lives to the left of the mystery book reader.
2. The history book buff lives to the left of the cat lover.
3. The root beer lover and the guitarist live next to each other.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover and the guitarist live next to each other. Since they live next to each other, one of them must live in house 1 and the other in house 2.

Now, let's look at clue 2: The history book buff lives to the left of the cat lover. This means the cat lover cannot live in house 1 because if the cat lover lived in house 1, the history book buff would have to live in house 2, but then the root beer lover and the guitarist would have to live in house 1 and house 2, which is not possible because they live next to each other.

So, the cat lover must live in house 2. This means the history book buff lives in house 1.

Now, let's look at clue 1: The cellist lives to the left of the mystery book reader. Since the history book buff lives in house 1, the cellist must live in house 1 and the mystery book reader must live in house 2.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: History book buff (cellist)
- House 2: Cat lover (mystery book reader)

But we still need to figure out who lives in house 1 and who lives in house 2. We know the root beer lover and the guitarist live next to each other, and the cat lover lives in house 2. So, the root beer lover and the guitarist must live in house 1.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Root beer lover (guitarist)
- House 2: Cat lover (mystery book reader)

But we still need to figure out who owns the horses. We know the cellist lives in house 1, but the cellist is not the horse owner. The only one left is the history book buff, but the history book buff lives in house 1. This is a contradiction.

Let's go back to the beginning and try a different arrangement. We know the root beer lover and the guitarist live next to each other. Let's try the following arrangement:

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives to the right of the bird keeper.
2. The dog owner does not live in the second house.
3. The person who has a vase of tulips lives to the right of the dog owner.

From clue 2, we know the dog owner is not in the second house. This means the dog owner is either in house 1 or house 3.

From clue 3, the person with tulips lives to the right of the dog owner. If the dog owner is in house 1, then the person with tulips would be in house 2. If the dog owner is in house 3, then the person with tulips would be in house 3.

However, from clue 1, the person with carnations lives to the right of the bird keeper. If the dog owner is in house 1, then the bird keeper would be in house 2, and the person with carnations would be in house 3. This would mean the person with tulips (house 2) is to the right of the dog owner (house 1), which is correct.

So, the correct order is: house 1 (dog owner), house 2 (bird keeper), house 3 (carnations). The person with tulips lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this problem, let's break down the clues and use the process of elimination.

From clue 4, we know the swimmer lives in the fourth house. 

From clue 6, we know the person with a vase of tulips lives directly left of the cricketer. Since the cricketer can't be in the fourth house, the cricketer must be in the third house. 

From clue 6, the person with a vase of tulips must be in the second house.

From clue 1, the person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person with a vase of tulips. Since the person with a vase of tulips is in the second house, the person wearing high heels must be in the first house.

From clue 11, the person with a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person eating a banana. Since the person with a vase of tulips is in the second house, the person with a rose bouquet must be in the first house. But we already know the person in the first house is wearing high heels. So, the person with a rose bouquet must be in the first house, and the person eating a banana must be in the second house.

From clue 8, the person eating oranges lives to the left of the person with a computer. Since the person with a vase of tulips is in the second house, the person eating oranges must be in the first house. But we already know the person in the first house is wearing high heels and has a rose bouquet. So, the person eating oranges must be in the first house, and the person with a computer must be in the third house.

From clue 12, the person with a gameboy lives to the left of the basketball player. Since the person with a computer is in the third house, the person with a gameboy must be in the second house. But we already know the person in the second house is eating a banana. So, the person with a gameboy must be in the second house, and the person eating a banana must be in the second house, which is a contradiction. This means our previous assumption that the person with a vase of tulips is in the second house is incorrect.

From clue 6, the person with a vase of tulips lives directly left of the cricketer. Since the cricketer is in the third house, the person with a vase of tulips must be in the second house is incorrect. The person with a vase of tulips must be in the first house.

So, the person with a phone must be in the first house, and the person wearing sandals must be in the second house.

From clue 5, the person wearing loafers does not live in the second house. Since the person in the second house is wearing sandals, the person wearing loafers must be in the third or fourth house.

From clue 3, there is one house between the person wearing boots and the person eating kiwis. Since the person in the fourth house is a swimmer, the person wearing boots must be in the third house. But we already know the person in the third house is eating oranges is incorrect, and the person in the third house has a computer. So, the person eating kiwis must be in the first house, and the person wearing boots must be in the third house.

From clue 9, the person with a bouquet of lilies does not live in the third house. Since the person in the third house is wearing boots, the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in the first or fourth house.

From clue 10, the person wearing loafers does not live in the third house. Since the person in the third house is wearing boots, the person wearing loafers must be in the first or fourth house.

From clue 8, the person eating oranges lives to the left of the person with a computer. Since the person with a computer is in the third house, the person eating oranges must be in the first or second house.

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.
2. The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.
3. The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
4. The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.
5. The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.
6. The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.

From clue 1, the person eating mangos lives in house 1.

From clue 2, the person who owns horses does not live in house 1, so they can live in house 2, 3, or 4.

From clue 3, the bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other. Since they live next to each other, they can't live in house 1 (because the person eating mangos lives there) and they can't live in house 4 (because there's no space for them to live next to each other). So, they must live in house 2 and 3.

From clue 4, the person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house. This means the person eating a banana must live in house 2 or 4.

From clue 6, the person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner. This means the person eating a banana must live in house 2, and the dog owner must live in house 3.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: person eating mangos
- House 2: person eating banana
- House 3: dog owner
- House 4: person eating kiwis

From clue 3, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis live directly next to each other. Since the person eating kiwis lives in house 4, the bird keeper must live in house 3. But we already know the dog owner lives in house 3. This is a contradiction.

However, we can try another arrangement:
- House 1: person eating mangos
- House 2: person eating kiwis
- House 3: dog owner
- House 4: person eating banana

From clue 3, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis live directly next to each other. Since the person eating kiwis lives in house 2, the bird keeper must live in house 1. But we already know the person eating mangos lives in house 1. This is a contradiction.

However, we can try another arrangement:
- House 1: person eating kiwis
- House 2: person eating banana
- House 3: dog owner
- House 4: person eating mangos

From clue 3, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis live directly next to each other. Since the person eating kiwis lives in house 1, the bird keeper must live in house 1. This arrangement is consistent with all the clues.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
2. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house.
3. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.
4. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.

From clue 4, we know the mystery book reader lives in the first house. 

From clue 3, the bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the history book buff cannot live in the first house because the bird keeper would have to live in the first house if the history book buff lived in the first house. Since the mystery book reader lives in the first house, the history book buff must live in the second house, and the bird keeper must live in the first house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Bird keeper
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Unknown

From clue 1, the romance book lover does not live in the third house. This means the romance book lover must live in either the first or second house.

From clue 2, the person who owns horses does not live in the third house. This means the person who owns horses must live in either the first or second house.

Since the bird keeper lives in the first house, the person who owns horses must live in the second house. This leaves the first house for the romance book lover.

So, the romance book lover lives in the first house."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The coffee drinker lives in the second house.
2. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
3. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the first house.
4. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
5. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
6. The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the coffee drinker lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person eating apples lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the person eating apples must live in the first house, and the person who only drinks water must live in the second house. But we already know the coffee drinker lives in the second house, so this is a contradiction. This means our initial assumption that the person eating apples lives in the first house is incorrect.

From clue 5, we know the person eating apples lives to the left of the tea drinker. This means the person eating apples must live in the first house, and the tea drinker must live in the third or fourth house.

From clue 2, we know the person eating apples lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the person eating apples must live in the first house, and the person who only drinks water must live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the coffee drinker lives in the second house. This means the person who only drinks water cannot live in the second house, so the person eating apples must live in the first house, and the person who only drinks water must live in the fourth house.

From clue 3, we know the person eating mangos does not live in the first house. This means the person eating mangos must live in the third or fourth house.

From clue 4, we know the person eating mangos does not live in the third house. This means the person eating mangos must live in the fourth house.

From clue 6, we know the person eating kiwis does not live in the third house. This means the person eating kiwis must live in the first or fourth house.

From clue 2, we know the person eating apples lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the person eating apples must live in the first house, and the person who only drinks water must live in the fourth house.

From clue 5, we know the person eating apples lives to the left of the tea drinker. This means the person eating apples must live in the first house, and the tea drinker must live in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the coffee drinker lives in the second house.

So, the correct order is:
- House 1: person eating apples
- House 2: coffee drinker
- House 3: tea drinker
- House 4: person eating mangos and person who only drinks water

The coffee drinker lives in the second house, so the correct answer is (D) 2."
"From clue 9, we know the person who likes white lives in the second house. 

From clue 1, the person who likes red lives directly to the right of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house, the person who likes red lives in the third house.

From clue 12, the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house.

The answer is (D) 3."
"Let's break down the clues to figure out the arrangement of the houses.

From clue 8, the soccer player lives in the second house.

From clue 6, the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the soccer player is in the second house, the person who has a rose bouquet must be in the first house, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in the third house.

From clue 1, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who has a rose bouquet is in the first house, the person who is wearing high heels must be in the first house. This means the person who had stew is in the third house, which is already occupied by the person who ate spaghetti. This is a contradiction, so the person who had stew cannot be in the third house. However, from clue 5, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. This means the person who had stew must be in the first house, and the person who is wearing high heels must be in the second house.

From clue 7, the person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew is in the first house, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in the third house.

From clue 3, the golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the person who has a rose bouquet is in the first house, the golfer must be in the third house. However, we already know the person who is wearing running shoes is in the third house. This is a contradiction, so the golfer must be in the second house, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in the third house.

From clue 2, there is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives. Since the golfer is in the second house, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in the first house.

From clue 4, the mystery book reader does not live in the second house. Since the golfer is in the second house, the mystery book reader must be in the first house or the third house. However, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in the first house, and the person who is wearing running shoes is in the third house. This means the mystery book reader must be in the third house.

From clue 6, the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who has a rose bouquet is in the first house, the person who ate spaghetti is in the third house.

From clue 5, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. Since the person who had stew is in the first house, the history book buff must be in the second house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: person with a bouquet of daffodils, wearing high heels, mystery book reader
- House 2: history book buff, soccer player
- House 3: person who had stew, wearing running shoes, science fiction book fanatic

The person who has a carnations arrangement is not in the first house (daffodils), not in the second house (soccer player), and not in the third house (stew). Therefore, the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in the second house.

The answer is (C) 2."

From clue 11, the person who"
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
2. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.

From clue 1, we know the person eating grapes lives left of the person driving a truck. This means the person driving a truck lives in house 2.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes yellow lives left of the person driving a truck. Since the person driving a truck lives in house 2, the person who likes yellow lives in house 1.

From clue 2, we know the person wearing boots lives left of the mystery book reader. Since the person who likes yellow lives in house 1, the person wearing boots must live in house 1 as well, because the person wearing boots lives left of the mystery book reader.

Now we have the following information:
- House 1: person wearing boots, likes yellow
- House 2: person driving a truck

From the given information, we know the person in house 1 is not eating grapes (because the person eating grapes lives left of the person driving a truck, and the person in house 1 is driving a truck). So, the person in house 1 must be eating oranges.

We also know the person in house 2 is driving a truck, so the person in house 2 is not eating grapes. Therefore, the person in house 2 must be eating oranges.

Now we have the following information:
- House 1: person wearing boots, likes yellow, eating oranges
- House 2: person driving a truck, eating oranges

From the given information, we know the person in house 1 is not a mystery book reader (because the person wearing boots lives left of the mystery book reader). So, the person in house 2 must be the mystery book reader.

Now we have the following information:
- House 1: person wearing boots, likes yellow, eating oranges
- House 2: person driving a truck, eating oranges, mystery book reader

The only remaining option is that the person in house 1 is the fantasy book enthusiast.

The answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this problem, let's break down the clues and use a process of elimination.

From clue 9, we know the person who likes green lives in the third house.

From clue 12, we know the person who drives a minivan and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other.

From clue 8, we know the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.

From clue 7, we know the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the mystery book reader.

From clue 13, we know the romance book lover lives directly left of the mystery book reader.

From clue 2, we know there are two houses between where the mystery book reader lives and where the person who had stew lives.

From clue 3, we know the history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.

From clue 1, we know the history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.

From clue 6, we know the person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes blue lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic.

From clue 5, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.

From clue 10, we know there is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the person who drives a convertible lives.

From clue 11, we know there are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.

From clue 14, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes blue.

Now, let's put all the information together:

- The person who likes green lives in the third house.
- The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the mystery book reader, and the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
- The person who drives a minivan and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other.
- The person who likes blue lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic.
- The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue.
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
- There is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the person who drives a convertible lives.
- There are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes blue.

From the given information, we can start by placing the person who likes green in the third house.

Now, let's try to place the person who drives a minivan and the person who ate fried rice. Since they live next to each other, and the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the mystery book reader, the person who drives a minivan must be in the first house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house.

Now, let's place the person who likes blue. Since the person who likes blue lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic, and the person who likes green lives in the third house, the person who likes blue must live in the fourth house, and the science fiction book fanatic must live in the fifth house.

Now, let's place the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue, the person who likes white must live in the second house.

Now, let's place the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible, and the person who drives a minivan lives in the first house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house. However, we already placed the person who likes white in the second house. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate our previous placements.

Let's try to place the person who ate grilled cheese in the second house. Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible, the person who drives a convertible must live in the third house.

Now, let's place the person who likes white.

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
2. The basketball player lives in the second house.
3. The violinist lives in the second house.

From clue 2 and 3, we know the violinist and basketball player live in the second house. Since they are different people, they must be the same person is not possible, so they live in the second house.

"Let's break down the clues to find the solution.

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The violinist lives in the first house.
2. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.

From clue 1, we know the violinist lives in house 1. 

From clue 2, we know the person with a computer lives to the left of the bird keeper. Since the violinist is in house 1, the person with a computer must be in house 1 as well, because there's no other house to the left of the bird keeper's house.

Now, we know the person with a computer is in house 1, and the violinist is also in house 1. This means the person with a computer and the violinist are the same person, which is not possible according to the problem statement. However, this is not the case. The problem statement says each person has different characteristics, so the person in house 1 must be the violinist and the person in house 2 must be the computer user.

Now, we know the violinist is in house 1 and the computer user is in house 2. From clue 2, the bird keeper must be in house 2 because the computer user is to the left of the bird keeper.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To find the house number of the person who has a computer, we need to follow the clues and narrow down the possibilities.

From clue 20, the person who has a gameboy lives in the first house. From clue 4, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the first house. Since the person who has a gameboy lives in the first house, the person who has a rose bouquet must be the same person. 

From clue 8, the person who has a rose bouquet lives to the left of the history book buff. So, the history book buff lives in the second house.

From clue 1, the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house. From clue 2, the person who is wearing boots lives to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the third house.

From clue 12, the person who has a television lives in the third house. Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the third house, the person who has a television must be the same person. 

From clue 16, the person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other. Since the person who has a television lives in the third house, the person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a computer must live in the second and fourth houses, respectively.

From clue 10, the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. From clue 5, the person who had pizza lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. So, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the fifth house.

From clue 9, the science fiction book fanatic does not live in the fifth house. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the fifth house, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first, second, or third house. However, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the first house, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips (clue 19). The person who has a vase of tulips must live in the second house, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in the third house. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips, so the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the third house. The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the third house. The science fiction book fanatic cannot live in the second or third house, so the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first house.

From clue 14, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house. However, the person who has a gameboy lives in the first house. The person who has a carnations arrangement cannot live in the first house, so there must be a mistake in the previous conclusion. The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the third house. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips, so the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the third house. The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the third house. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic (clue 14), and the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the right of the history book buff (clue 6). The person who has a bouquet of lilies cannot live in the first house, so the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth or fifth house. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the right of the history book buff, and the history book buff lives in the second house. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth or fifth house, and the history book buff lives in the second house. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the right of the history book buff, so the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.

3. The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.
4. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who is wearing boots.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From clue 5, we know the cat lover lives in the first house. 

From clue 4, the person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house, the person who owns an SUV must live in the first house.

The Gunpowder Plot was a failed assassination attempt in 1605 to blow up the English House of Lords during the state opening of the English Parliament. The plot was led by a group of conspirators, including Robert Catesby, who were primarily Catholic and wanted to overthrow King James I of England, who was also the King of Scotland. 

Mary, Queen of Scots, was the Queen of Scotland and the claimant to the English throne. She was a Catholic and had been executed in 1587 for her involvement in plots to assassinate Queen Elizabeth I of England. 

The Gunpowder Plot failed, and King James I survived. When James I died in 1625, he was succeeded by his son Charles I, who was the son of James I and Anne of Denmark, a Protestant. Charles I's son, Charles II, was also a Protestant. 

So, the Gunpowder Plot did not directly eliminate Mary, Queen of Scots' bloodline, but it did not help her claim to the English throne either."

The reason is that Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a fantasy novel by Lewis Carroll, and the story is about a girl who falls down a rabbit hole and enters a fantastical world. The story is not meant to be taken literally, and it's not based on real-world events or societies.

Oscar Wilde was arrested and put on trial in the UK for gross indecency in 1895. He was found guilty and sentenced to two years of hard labor. This was due to his being gay, which was considered a crime at that time. In the US, laws and societal attitudes towards LGBTQ+ individuals have changed significantly since then. Many states have laws protecting LGBTQ+ rights, and the US Supreme Court has ruled in favor of LGBTQ+ rights in several cases. Therefore, Oscar Wilde's treatment under the law would not be considered fair in the US today."

SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) medications are generally considered safe for adults, but research suggests that they may be less safe for teenagers and young adults. This is because the brain is still developing in this age group, and SSRIs can affect the developing brain in ways that are not yet fully understood.

In 2004, the FDA issued a warning that antidepressants, including SSRIs, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children and adolescents. This warning was based on data from clinical trials that showed a higher rate of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in young people taking antidepressants compared to those taking a placebo.

While SSRIs can be effective in treating depression in teenagers and young adults, the potential risks and benefits should be carefully weighed by a healthcare professional before prescribing these medications."

Sheol is actually a concept from the Hebrew Bible, and it's often translated as ""the underworld"" or ""the grave"". In the Old Testament, Sheol is a place where the dead reside, but it's not a place of reward or punishment. It's more of a neutral or a resting place for the dead.

In Christianity, the concept of Sheol is not directly related to the Christian understanding of the afterlife. Christians believe in a more complex afterlife, with heaven and hell as the ultimate destinations for the righteous and the wicked, respectively."

But if we consider the largest ship that Columbus used, it was the nao Santa Maria, which was about 62 feet long and 20 feet wide. The Statue of Liberty is about 305 feet tall and 154 feet wide. However, if we consider the ship's cargo capacity, the Santa Maria could carry around 50 tons of cargo. The Statue of Liberty weighs around 225 tons."

Cerebral palsy is a condition that affects muscle movement, muscle tone, or posture. It's caused by brain damage that happens before, during, or shortly after birth, or it can be caused by head injuries. 

In the story of the Wizard of Oz, the Scarecrow is a character who wants a brain. He thinks he's not smart because he doesn't have one. However, this is not a realistic portrayal of how intelligence or brain function works. 

But, if we consider the Scarecrow's situation in a more imaginative way, it's possible that the Scarecrow could have had a brain injury or a condition like cerebral palsy that affected his physical abilities, but not his intelligence. This would make his desire for a brain more understandable, as he might be experiencing physical limitations that make him feel like he's not capable of doing things."

The Battle of Actium was fought in 31 BC, and the Brazilian Navy doesn't exist yet. However, if we consider the modern Brazilian Navy, it's a well-equipped and technologically advanced force. 

If the Brazilian Navy were to be transported back in time to the Battle of Actium, they would have a significant advantage over the ancient fleets of Octavian and Mark Antony. The Brazilian Navy has modern ships with advanced technology, including radar, sonar, and guided missiles, which would give them a significant edge in terms of firepower and maneuverability.

Additionally, the Brazilian Navy has a well-trained crew with modern tactics and strategies, which would allow them to take advantage of their technological superiority. They could potentially use their advanced ships to outmaneuver and outgun the ancient fleets, turning the tide of the battle in their favor.

So, in a hypothetical scenario where the Brazilian Navy is transported back in time to the Battle of Actium, it's likely that they could have turned the tide of the battle in their favor."

"Let's follow the steps of the dance to figure out who Dave is dancing with at the end.

1. Dave and Bob switch partners. So, Dave is now dancing with Patrick, and Bob is dancing with Melissa.
2. Claire and Dave switch partners. So, Claire is now dancing with Patrick, and Dave is dancing with Ophelia.
3. Eve and Alice switch partners. So, Eve is now dancing with Jamie, and Alice is dancing with Rodrigo.
4. Claire and Eve switch partners. So, Claire is now dancing with Eve, and Eve is dancing with Patrick.
5. Alice and Eve switch partners. So, Alice is now dancing with Patrick, and Eve is dancing with Rodrigo.

Now, let's look at the final dance partners of the people we care about: Dave and Claire. Claire is dancing with Eve, and Eve is dancing with Rodrigo. So, Claire is dancing with Rodrigo, and Eve is dancing with Rodrigo. But we want to know who Dave is dancing with. We know that Dave is dancing with Ophelia after the second switch. The last switch doesn't affect Dave's partner. So, Dave is dancing with Ophelia.

The answer is (A) Ophelia."
"Let's follow the position changes step by step:

   - Claire (left midfielder) becomes fullback

5. Alice and Eve trade positions:
   - Alice (benchwarmer) becomes fullback
   - Eve (fullback) becomes benchwarmer

Now, let's look at the final positions:
- Alice is fullback
- Bob is right midfielder
- Claire is fullback
- Dave is left midfielder
- Eve is benchwarmer

So, Eve is playing benchwarmer at the end of the match. The correct answer is (C)."

After the fifth switch, Dave was dancing with Alice, but Alice was now dancing with Bob, and Bob was dancing with Eve. 

So, Dave was dancing with Alice throughout the dance, and Alice was dancing with Bob at the end. But we need to find out who Dave is dancing with at the end. Since Dave was dancing with Alice throughout the dance, and Alice was dancing with Bob at the end, Dave must be dancing with the partner of Bob at the end. 

At the end, Bob is dancing with Eve. So, Dave is dancing with Eve's partner, which is Jamie. The answer is (C) Jamie."

"To find out who Claire is dancing with at the end, we need to follow the sequence of partner changes.

1. Fred and Eve switch partners. This doesn't affect Claire.
2. Bob and Dave switch partners. This doesn't affect Claire.
3. Eve and Alice switch partners. This means Eve is now dancing with Alice, and Alice is dancing with Eve's previous partner, which is Karl.
4. Bob and Claire switch partners. This means Bob is now dancing with Claire, and Claire is dancing with Bob's previous partner, which is Helga.
5. Eve and Alice switch partners again. This means Eve is now dancing with Alice's previous partner, which is Karl, and Alice is dancing with Eve's previous partner, which is still Karl (from step 3). But we already know Eve is dancing with Karl, so this step doesn't change anything for Claire.
6. Gertrude and Fred switch partners. This means Gertrude is now dancing with Fred's previous partner, which is Ophelia, and Fred is dancing with Gertrude's previous partner, which is Lola.
7. Bob and Dave switch partners again. This means Bob is now dancing with Dave's previous partner, which is Sam, and Dave is dancing with Bob's previous partner, which is Helga.

Now, let's look at the partners of the people Claire danced with. Claire danced with Helga in step 4, and Helga is now dancing with Dave. So Claire is dancing with the person who was dancing with Helga in step 7, which is Dave's partner, Sam."
"Let's follow the steps of the dance to find out who Bob is dancing with at the end.

1. Bob and Dave switch partners. So, Bob is now dancing with Karl, and Dave is dancing with Ophelia.
2. Gertrude and Fred switch partners. So, Gertrude is now dancing with Melissa, and Fred is dancing with Helga.
3. Fred and Bob switch partners. So, Fred is now dancing with Karl, and Bob is dancing with Helga.
4. Eve and Bob switch partners. So, Eve is now dancing with Helga, and Bob is dancing with Ophelia.
5. Gertrude and Alice switch partners. So, Gertrude is now dancing with Jamie, and Alice is dancing with Melissa.
6. Fred and Claire switch partners. So, Fred is now dancing with Patrick, and Claire is dancing with Karl.

Now, let's look at the final positions:
- Eve is dancing with Karl.
- Claire is dancing with Helga.
- Gertrude is dancing with Jamie.
- Fred is dancing with Patrick.
