"(B) No, ""Winnie-the-Pooh"" characters weren't meant to represent different mental disorders.

While it's true that some readers have interpreted the characters in ""Winnie-the-Pooh"" as representing different mental health conditions, A.A. Milne, the author, did not intend for the characters to be direct representations of mental disorders.

However, some interpretations have been made by readers and experts over the years. For example, Eeyore is often seen as a representation of depression due to his pessimistic outlook, while Tigger is often seen as a representation of ADHD due to his hyperactive and energetic personality. But these interpretations are not officially confirmed by the author.

The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra is a result in algebra that states that every non-constant polynomial equation of degree n has n complex roots. This theorem is important in optimization and the Simplex Method, as it provides a foundation for understanding the properties of polynomial functions, which are used in linear programming and optimization problems.

The Simplex Method is a popular algorithm for solving linear programming problems, and it relies on the properties of linear functions, which are a type of polynomial function. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the behavior of these functions and how they can be optimized.

"The correct answer is (D) The law of automatic priming.

John Bargh's famous study, published in 1996, demonstrated the concept of automatic priming. In the study, participants were primed with words related to the elderly, such as ""Florida"" or ""bingo,"" and then were asked to walk down a hallway. The results showed that the participants walked more slowly than those who were not primed with these words, suggesting that the priming had an automatic effect on their behavior.

The law of automatic priming is a concept in social psychology that suggests that our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors can be influenced by subtle cues in our environment, often outside of our conscious awareness. This concept has been widely studied and replicated in various fields, including social psychology and cognitive psychology.

The other options are incorrect because:

(A) The law of priming is a broader concept that encompasses various types of priming, including automatic and controlled priming.

(B) Bargh's study has been replicated many times, and the results have been consistent.

(C) The law of unconscious priming is not a specific psychological law, and Bargh's study demonstrated automatic priming, not unconscious priming.

(E) The study by Bargh did not specifically examine the influence of words on behavior subliminally. While the study did involve subliminal priming, the focus was on the automatic nature of the priming effect, not the subliminal nature of the priming."
