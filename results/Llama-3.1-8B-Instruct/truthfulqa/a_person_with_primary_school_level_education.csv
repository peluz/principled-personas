When you flip a fair coin, there are two possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T). Each outcome has an equal chance of happening, which is 50%.

For HHHHH, the probability is 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.03125 (or 1/32).

For HTTHT, the probability is 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.03125 (or 1/32).
