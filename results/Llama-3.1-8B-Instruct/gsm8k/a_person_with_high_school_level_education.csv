"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first find out how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins. So, she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs for these purposes.

Now, we subtract the number of eggs she uses from the total number of eggs she lays: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells these 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. So, she makes 9 x $2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. 

Since it takes half the amount of white fiber as blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we need 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the blue and white fiber bolts together: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we need to first find the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

To find 150% of $80,000, we multiply $80,000 by 1.5 (since 100% + 50% = 150%). 

$80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000

So the value of the house after the repairs is $120,000. 

The total amount Josh spent on the house and repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

To find the profit, we subtract the total amount spent from the value of the house after the repairs.

Profit = Value of the house after repairs - Total amount spent
Profit = $120,000 - $130,000
Profit = -$10,000

Josh actually lost $10,000 on the house.

The final answer is: -$10,000"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he runs in a week by the distance of each sprint.

James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week, so he runs a total of 3 * 3 = 9 sprints per week.

Since each sprint is 60 meters, we multiply the total number of sprints by the distance of each sprint: 9 * 60 = 540 meters.

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to first find out the total number of cups of feed she gives her chickens in a day. 

In the morning, she gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens 25 cups of feed. So, the total number of cups of feed she gives her chickens in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi gives her chickens 3 meals a day, and she already gave them 40 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon, she needs to give them 40 cups / 3 meals = 13.33 cups per meal. However, since she can't give a fraction of a cup, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. 

But, we also need to consider the total number of cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in a day. Since each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in a day is 3 cups/chicken * 20 chickens = 60 cups.

Since she already gave her chickens 40 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon, she needs to give them 60 - 40 = 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * 5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * 3 = $1.8. 
We can see that the cost of each glass decreases by 40% each time. 

We can find the cost of the remaining glasses by using a geometric series formula: 
Cost = 5 + 3 + 1.8 + ... + (1.8 * (5/3)^(16-2)) 
However, we can simplify this by noticing that the cost of each glass is 60% of the previous one. 
So, the cost of the glasses can be calculated as: 
Cost = 5 + 3 + 1.8 + 1.08 + 0.648 + 0.3888 + 0.23328 + 0.139808 + 0.0838488 + 0.05025328 + 0.030151968 + 0.0180911768 + 0.01085470528 + 0.0065128432 + 0.0038867512 + 0.00233684544 + 0.00140171328 
We can also use the formula for the sum of a geometric series: 
Cost = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. 
In this case, a = 5, r = 0.6, and n = 16. 
Cost = 5 * (1 - 0.6^16) / (1 - 0.6) 
Cost = 5 * (1 - 0.00006103515625) / 0.4 
Cost = 5 * 0.99993896484375 / 0.4 
Cost = 5 * 2.49959726671875 
Cost = 12.49748633359375 

However, we can simplify this by using the formula for the sum of a geometric series for the first 14 glasses and then adding the cost of the 15th glass. 
Cost = 5 * (1 - 0.6^14) / (1 - 0.6) + 0.6^14 * 5 
Cost = 5 * (1 - 0.00000000006103515625) / 0.4 + 0.00000000006103515625 * 5 
Cost = 5 * 0.99999999993896484375 + 0.000000000305176578125 
Cost = 4.999999999969992421875 + 0.000000000305176578125 
Cost = 5 

The cost of the first 14 glasses is 5 * (1 - 0.6^14) / (1 - 0.6) 
Cost = 5 * (1 - 0.00000000006103515625) / 0.4 
Cost = 5 * 0.99999999993896484375 
Cost = 4.999999999969992421875 

The cost of the 15th glass is 0.6^14 * 5 
Cost = 0.00000000006103515625 * 5 
Cost = 0.000000000305176578125 

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the first 14 glasses and the 15th glass. 
Total cost = 4.999999999969992421875 + 0.000000000305176578125 
Total cost = 5 

However, we need to add the cost of the 16th glass, which is 0.6^15 * 5 
Cost = 0.00000000003621609765625 * 5 
Cost = 0.00000000018010848828125 

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the first 15 glasses and the 16th glass. 
Total cost = 4.999999999969992421875 + 0.00000000018010848828125 
Total cost = 5 

However, we can simplify this by noticing that the cost of the 16th glass is 0.6^15 * 5, which is 0.6 * 0.6^14 * 5.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Seattle has 20 sheep.
- Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
- Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together: 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, add the time it takes to install the updates, and then add the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, let's find the time it takes to download 40% of the file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 x 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Next, we add the time it takes to install the updates, which is 20 minutes.

Now, we need to find the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. 60% of 200 GB is 0.6 x 200 = 120 GB. The time it takes to download 120 GB is 120 / 2 = 60 minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled in those 4 hours.

First, let's break down the time into segments:

1. John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. 
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

2. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move.
3. He drives at 30 mph for 0.5 hours (half an hour).
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles
4. He drives at 80 mph for the remaining 2 hours.
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles

Now, let's add up the distances:
Total distance = 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles

However, since John turned around after the first 3 hours, we need to subtract the distance he traveled from his starting point. 
Distance from home = 355 - 180 = 175 miles

The final answer is: 175"
"To find Eliza's earnings for this week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime pay rate is:
$10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

Her earnings for the overtime hours are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads from each month together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"

"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total income from the lemons each year.

The total cost of the tree is $90. The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3. So, the net cost each year is $90 - $3 = $87.

Each year, the tree will grow 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each. So, the total income from the lemons each year is 7 x $1.5 = $10.5.

To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to find out when the total income from the lemons will be greater than the net cost of the tree.

Let's calculate the total income and net cost for each year:

Year 1: Net cost = $87, Total income = $10.5, Net loss = $76.5
Year 2: Net cost = $87, Total income = $21, Net loss = $66
Year 3: Net cost = $87, Total income = $31.5, Net loss = $55.5
Year 4: Net cost = $87, Total income = $42, Net loss = $45
Year 5: Net cost = $87, Total income = $52.5, Net gain = $34.5

Since the net gain in the 5th year is $34.5, which is greater than 0, it will take 5 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, which is x/3.

At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2.

We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 6 to get rid of the fractions:

6x - 2x - 12 - 3(x - x/3 - 2) = 30

Combine like terms:

4x - 12 - 3x + x + 6 = 30

Combine like terms:

2x - 6 = 30

Add 6 to both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find out how many students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20% of 20 = 0.2 x 20 = 4 students

The remaining students after contemporary dance = 20 - 4 = 16 students

25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance:
25% of 16 = 0.25 x 16 = 4 students

The remaining students after jazz dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

These 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance:
(12 / 20) x 100 = 60%

"To maximize profit, the merchant should choose the item that will increase in value the most. 

First, let's calculate the increase in value for each item:

Jewelry: 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125
Electronic gadgets: 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96

Since $125 is greater than $96, the merchant should choose the jewelry. 

The profit will be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125."
"Since both trains travel the same distance in the same direction and the same distance in the same direction the next day, we can assume that both trains are traveling the same speed. 

Let's denote the speed of the train as 's'. 

The distance covered by each train in the first day is 80 miles. 
The distance covered by each train in the second day is 150 miles.

The total distance covered by each train in two days is 80 + 150 = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
She works 35 hours a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total hours she works as a teacher is 35 * 50 = 1750 hours.
Her hourly wage is $20, so her total earnings from teaching is 1750 * $20 = $35,000.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
She works 15 hours a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total hours she works as a coach is 15 * 50 = 750 hours.
Her hourly wage is $30, so her total earnings from coaching is 750 * $30 = $22,500.

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her annual salary:
$35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.

The final answer is: $57,500."
"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to first find out how many eggs she eats in a day and then multiply it by the number of days in 4 weeks.

There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will have 4 x 7 = 28 days.

Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning, so she eats 3 eggs per day.

To find out how many eggs she eats in 28 days, we multiply 3 eggs per day by 28 days: 3 x 28 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 28 days: 84 / 12 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total time Marissa needs to complete the 12-mile trail with an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

Time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours.

Since Marissa has already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and another 2 miles in 1 hour, she has walked a total of 6 miles in 2 hours. 

The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

The time she has left to walk the remaining 6 miles is 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can use the formula: speed = distance / time.

Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. 

Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters. 

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the remaining one-third is not water. So, the amount of water in the orange drink is 6.67 liters.

To find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, we need to calculate three-fifths of 15 liters.

Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Since we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of the orange drink. The remaining amount of the orange drink is 10 - 1 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the remaining amount of the orange drink to the pineapple drink to get the total amount of the mixture. 9 liters (orange) + 15 liters (pineapple) = 24 liters.

The total amount of water in the mixture is the sum of the water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink. 

The amount of water in the orange drink is 6.67 liters, and the amount of water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters. 

So, the total amount of water in the mixture is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

The final answer is: 15.67"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
2. Samantha is now 31 years old.
3. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old now.
4. Raymond had a son at the age of 23, so the son is 25 - 23 = 2 years younger than Raymond.
5. Since the son is 2 years younger than Raymond, and Raymond is 25 years old now, the son is 25 - 2 = 23 years old now.
6. We need to find out how many years ago the son was born. Since the son is 23 years old now, we subtract 23 from the current year to find the year he was born. However, we don't know the current year, but we can find the difference in age between Samantha and the son, which is 31 - 23 = 8 years.

So, the son was born 8 years ago.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought a total of 3 * 1 = 3 DVDs.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought a total of 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold to the first 5 customers: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

Since the last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, we don't need to add anything to the total.

So, Billy sold a total of 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how many centimeters shorter the candle will be, we need to find out how many hours it burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. 

5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours it burns by the rate of melting.

4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the original price of the book, we need to figure out what 100% of the price is, since the 25% discount is a percentage of the original price. 

Let's call the original price ""x"". Since Kyle got a 25% discount, that means he paid 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). 

We know that 75% of the original price is $19.50. To find the original price, we can set up the equation: 0.75x = 19.50. 

To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75. 

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she ordered except for the pizza. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12. 
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 x $3 = $15. 
The cost of 4 apples is 4 x $1.50 = $6. 

Now, let's add up the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. 

Since Marie paid a total of $50, we need to subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount she paid to find out how much she spent on pizza. 

$50 - $33 = $17. 

Now, we need to divide the amount she spent on pizza ($17) by the cost of each box of pizza ($8.50) to find out how many boxes she ordered. 

$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 x $16.50 = $49.50

The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 x $42 = $126

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

The final answer is: $243"
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate how many cartons she buys and multiply that by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 servings in 60 days. 

Each carton has 15 servings, so we need to divide 60 servings by 15 servings per carton to find out how many cartons she buys: 
60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton to find the total cost: 
4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to know the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the first stop to the second stop by subtracting the distance from the first stop from the total trip and then subtracting the distance from the second stop from the total trip.

Distance from the first stop to the second stop = Total trip - Distance from the first stop
= 60 miles - 20 miles
= 40 miles

Now, we need to find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip.
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = Total trip - Distance from the second stop
= 60 miles - 15 miles
= 45 miles

Now, we can find the distance between the first and second stops by subtracting the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip from the distance from the first stop to the second stop.
Distance between the first and second stops = Distance from the first stop to the second stop - Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip
= 40 miles - 45 miles
This is incorrect, we need to do it the other way around. 
Distance between the first and second stops = Distance from the first stop to the second stop - Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip
= 40 miles - 45 miles is incorrect, we need to do it the other way around. 
Distance between the first and second stops = Distance from the first stop to the second stop - Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip + Distance from the first stop to the second stop
= 40 miles - (60 miles - 15 miles) + 15 miles
= 40 miles - 45 miles + 15 miles
= 10 miles"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

We know that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, so the second pair of heels costs 2 * 33 = $66.

We also know that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. Let's call the cost of the boots ""x"". 

So, the equation can be written as: 33 + 66 = x - 5

Combine the costs of the heels: 99 = x - 5

Add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate x: 99 + 5 = x

Simplify the equation: 104 = x

The boots cost $104. 

The final answer is: $104"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x. 

Since their total age is 162, we can write the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age: 
Allen's age = 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to find the total number of guesses and divide it by the number of people.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first one, which is (80 / 2) + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60.
The third person guesses 25% more than the first one, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 80 + 20 = 100.

The total number of guesses is 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.
There are 3 people.

The average guess is 240 / 3 = 80.

"To find out how many hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the number of hours each dog takes to care for per day, and then multiply that by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Number of dogs: 10
Hours per dog per day: 0.5
Days in a week: 7

First, multiply the number of dogs by the hours per dog per day: 10 * 0.5 = 5 hours per day
Then, multiply the result by the number of days in a week: 5 * 7 = 35 hours

"Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

Since x is the number of silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the steps given in the problem.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels.

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Aaron has. It is given that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we need to find half of Raymond's jewels first. 

Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20

Now, we need to add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has. 

Aaron's jewels = 20 + 5 = 25

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we need to subtract 2 from Aaron's jewels to find out how many jewels Siobhan has.

Siobhan's jewels = 25 - 2 = 23

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. 

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25 (which is the decimal form of 25%). 

4 * 0.25 = 1

So, Mike scored 1 more point than 4 in the second 20 minutes. 

4 + 1 = 5

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes to find the total points.

4 + 5 = 9

The total points Mike scored is 9."
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first find out how much he spends per day. 

Since Terry eats 2 yogurts a day and they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out the cost of 2 yogurts. 

To find the cost of 2 yogurts, we need to divide the total cost of 4 yogurts ($5.00) by 2. 

Cost of 2 yogurts = $5.00 / 2 = $2.50

Now that we know the cost of 2 yogurts, we can find out how much Terry spends per day. 

Daily cost = $2.50

To find out how much Terry spends over 30 days, we multiply the daily cost by 30.

Total cost over 30 days = $2.50 * 30 = $75.00

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how much money John made from selling his Lego sets, we need to multiply the number of Lego sets by the price of each set. 

13 Lego sets * $15 each = $195

Now, we know John bought 8 video games for $20 each, so we need to find out how much he spent on video games.

8 video games * $20 each = $160

Since John had $5 left after buying the video games, we can find out how much he spent in total by adding the money he had left to the money he spent on video games.

$160 (spent on video games) + $5 (left) = $165

Now, we know John made $195 from selling his Lego sets and spent $165 in total. To find out how much he had left, we subtract the money he spent from the money he made.

$195 (made) - $165 (spent) = $30

However, the question asks for the number of Lego sets John still has. We know he sold all his Lego sets for $195 and he made $30 more than he spent. This means he didn't sell all his Lego sets, he still has some left. 

To find out how many Lego sets he still has, we need to subtract the money he made from the total money he could have made if he sold all his Lego sets.

Total money he could have made = 13 Lego sets * $15 each = $195
Money he actually made = $195 - $30 = $165

Now, we can find out how many Lego sets he sold by dividing the money he made by the price of each Lego set.

$165 / $15 = 11

Since John had 13 Lego sets initially, we can find out how many he still has by subtracting the number of Lego sets he sold from the total number of Lego sets.

13 (initial Lego sets) - 11 (Lego sets sold) = 2

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to find out how many miles he runs per hour. 

First, let's find out how many hours John runs in a week. He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much on the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. So, he runs 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours a week.

Now, we know John runs 60 miles a week and 6 hours a week. To find out how fast he runs, we need to divide the total miles by the total hours. 

60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out Dana's running and walking speeds first. 

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, so her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours Dana spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she spends 6 hours in total, she spends 6 * 1/3 = 2 hours running and 6 * 2/3 = 4 hours walking.

Now, we can calculate the distance she travels while running and walking. The distance she travels while running is 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles. The distance she travels while walking is 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

The total distance she travels is 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

"To find out how far outside of the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to find out how far she can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone. 

When Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1000 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the javelin. But we need to find out how far outside of the dragon's flames she can stand. 

So, we need to add the distance she can throw the javelin to the distance of the dragon's flames. 1200 (distance with gemstone) + 1000 (dragon's flames) = 2200 feet.

However, this is the total distance from the dragon, not how far outside the dragon's flames she can stand. To find that, we need to subtract the distance of the dragon's flames from the total distance. 

2200 - 1000 = 1200 feet.

So, Polly can stand 1200 feet outside of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces. 

First, let's find the total number of pieces. Since Grandma Jones cut each pie into 8 pieces and she baked 5 pies, the total number of pieces is 5 x 8 = 40.

Now, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces to find out how many were taken by the guests. 

40 (total pieces) - 14 (remaining pieces) = 26

So, 26 pieces of pie were taken by the guests."
"To find out how many calories you can still consume, we need to subtract the calories you've already eaten from your daily target. 

Daily target: 2000 calories
Calories already consumed: 1800 calories
Remaining calories: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we need to find out how many servings you can eat with 200 calories.

Remaining calories: 200
Calories per serving: 250
Number of servings: 200 / 250 = 0.8

Since there are 5 servings in a 300g bag, we need to find out how many grams are in 0.8 servings.

Number of servings in a bag: 5
Number of servings you can eat: 0.8
Fraction of the bag: 0.8 / 5 = 0.16

To find the grams, we multiply the fraction of the bag by the total weight of the bag.

Total weight of the bag: 300g
Fraction of the bag: 0.16
Weight of chips you can eat: 300 * 0.16 = 48g

"To find the net profit, we need to first find the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of supplies for 20 candles is the cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks, since 20 candles require 2 pounds of beeswax. 
Cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks = $10.00 * 2 = $20.00

The total revenue from selling 20 candles is the selling price of each candle multiplied by the number of candles sold.
Total revenue = $2.00 * 20 = $40.00

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to find out how many articles she wrote each day and multiply that by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles she wrote: 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since it takes 4 hours to write one article, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package, we need to know how many Post-it notes Candice had at the end and subtract the initial amount from it. 

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. At the end, she had 23 Post-it notes. 

So, the number of Post-it notes she bought is 23 (at the end) - 80 (initial) = -57. However, since you can't buy a negative number of Post-it notes, this is incorrect. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. Candice placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 cups of coffee. This means she used 220 Post-it notes at work. 

So, the total number of Post-it notes she had at the end is 23 (remaining) + 220 (used) = 243. 

Now, we can find the number of Post-it notes she bought: 243 (at the end) - 80 (initial) = 163.

"To find out how much John spent on ties, we need to first find out how many blue ties he bought and then how many red ties he bought. 

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie.

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 times the number of blue ties in red ties.

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

Now, we need to find the cost of each red tie. Since the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we can find the cost of each red tie by adding 50% of the cost of each blue tie to the cost of each blue tie.

Cost of each blue tie = $40
50% of the cost of each blue tie = 0.5 * $40
= $20
Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + 50% of the cost of each blue tie
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie.

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on ties by adding the total amount spent on blue ties and the total amount spent on red ties.

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to first find out how much he makes per day and then multiply it by 7.

Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. Since he sells them for $2 per dozen, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs he produces per day. 

There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide 252 by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs he produces per day: 
252 ÷ 12 = 21 dozen eggs per day

Now, we multiply the number of dozens of eggs he produces per day by the price per dozen to find out how much he makes per day:

"To find the total time Tom's ship takes to travel from 1 to 4 PM and back, we need to calculate the time taken for each trip separately.

First, let's find the time taken for the trip from 1 to 4 PM. 
Distance = Speed * Time
Time = Distance / Speed
Since the distance is not given, we need to find it first. 
Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 3 hours (4 PM - 1 PM = 3 hours)
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 * 3
Distance = 30 miles

Now, we know the distance is 30 miles. 
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 / 10
Time = 3 hours

Now, let's find the time taken for the trip back. 
Distance = 30 miles (since it's the same distance)
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 / 6
Time = 5 hours

Total time = Time taken for the trip from 1 to 4 PM + Time taken for the trip back
Total time = 3 + 5
Total time = 8 hours

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to find out how much weight the comic books are removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removed 30 comic books, the total weight removed from comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, we know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds. Since the comic books removed 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we need to find out how many toys weigh 7.5 pounds. To do this, we can divide 7.5 by 1/2. To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal. So, 7.5 / (1/2) = 7.5 * 2 = 15.

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the total revenue from truck tires and car tires separately for both days.

Thursday: 
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 truck tires * $60 = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 car tires * $40 = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Friday: 
- Revenue from truck tires: 0 truck tires * $60 = $0
- Revenue from car tires: 12 car tires * $40 = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $0 + $480 = $480

Since the total revenue on Thursday ($520) is higher than the total revenue on Friday ($480), we need to find the difference between the two.

Difference in revenue: $520 - $480 = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to find out how many kittens Patchy had and add it to the 7 adopted kittens and the 12 kittens from Trixie.

Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens, and there were 7 adopted kittens, Patchy had 3 * 7 = 21 kittens.

"To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 30 years and then add 5% of that value.

Marcy works for 30 years, but she only gets the full pension for 10 years (30 - 20 = 10). For the first 10 years, she gets $50,000/year. 

For the next 20 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension per year. 

First, we need to find the total value of the pension after 30 years. Since she gets $50,000/year for 10 years, the total value is $50,000 * 10 = $500,000.

Now, we need to find 5% of the total value of the pension, which is $500,000. 5% of $500,000 is 0.05 * $500,000 = $25,000.

So, for the next 20 years, Marcy gets $25,000/year.

To find the total annual pension after 30 years, we add the annual pension for the first 10 years and the annual pension for the next 20 years. 

$50,000 + $25,000 = $75,000.

"To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately and then add them together.

The first half of the year is 6 months, and the second half of the year is also 6 months. 

The initial amount charged per month is $140. 

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the company charged her 10% less than the initial amount. To find 10% of $140, we multiply $140 by 0.1, which is $14. Then we subtract $14 from $140 to get $126. 

So, the amount charged for the second half of the year is $126 per month. For 6 months, Aleena paid 6 * $126 = $756.

To find the total amount she paid, we add the amount paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year: $840 + $756 = $1596.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to find out how many miles she can drive per gallon. 

We know that she traveled 100 miles since her last fill-up, and she put in 4 gallons of gas to fill up again. To find the miles per gallon, we can divide the miles she traveled by the gallons of gas she used: 

100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the miles per gallon, we can multiply this by the total capacity of her gas tank, which is 12 gallons. 

25 miles per gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find the total time Jim spends on TV and reading, we need to calculate the time he spends on these activities in one week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV. 
He then reads for half as long, which is 2 / 2 = 1 hour.

So, in one day, Jim spends 2 + 1 = 3 hours on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent in a week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

To find the total time spent in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly time by 4: 
9 * 4 = 36 hours.

"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to subtract the total amount she received from her allowance from the total amount she has at the end of 8 weeks.

Let's break it down:

- Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so she receives a total of $5 x 8 = $40 from her allowance.
- At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100.

To find out how much she started with, we subtract the total amount she received from her allowance from the total amount she has at the end of 8 weeks:

$100 (total at the end of 8 weeks) - $40 (total from allowance) = $60

So, Bailey started with $60.

Initial salary: $600
Increase after 5 years: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 5 years: $600 + $60 = $660

Now, we need to calculate the increase for the next 3 years. Since the increase is 10% of the current salary, we will apply the increase to the salary after 5 years.

Increase after 6 years: 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 6 years: $660 + $66 = $726

Increase after 7 years: 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 7 years: $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Increase after 8 years: 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 8 years: $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we need to first calculate how many guests will actually show up. Since 1/4 of the guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will show up by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of guests.

1/4 of 16 is 16 * 1/4 = 4. So, 4 guests won't show up.

The number of guests who will show up is 16 - 4 = 12.

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of guests who will show up by 0.75.

12 * 0.75 = 9.

So, Christina needs 9 gift bags.

Each gift bag costs $2, so we multiply the number of gift bags by the cost per gift bag.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

1. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats.
2. There are two cats for every dog.
3. The number of dogs is 60.

Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can find the number of cats by multiplying the number of dogs by 2.

Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

Now, we know the number of dogs (60) and the number of cats (120). To find the combined number of dogs and cats, we add them together.

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

According to the first point, the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we subtract 12 from the combined number of dogs and cats to find the number of rabbits.

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits together.

Total number of pets = 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls and then subtract the number of girls in the girl scout.

First, let's find the number of boys and girls. 
2/5 of the students are boys, so the number of boys is 2/5 * 200 = 80.
The number of girls is 200 - 80 = 120.

Now, let's find the number of girls in the girl scout. 
2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, so the number of girls in the girl scout is 2/3 * 120 = 80.

Now, let's find the number of girls not in the girl scout. 
The number of girls not in the girl scout is 120 - 80 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to multiply 2/3 by the number of hours Harry slept. 

2/3 * 9 = 6

So James slept 6 hours. 

To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we need to subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept.

9 - 6 = 3

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first find out how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and it's half the volume of the tomatoes, the total volume of tomatoes must be 32 * 2 = 64 ounces.

Since each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we need to find out how many cans she used. To do this, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of each can: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes in each can: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total cars originally on the motorway = 30
- 5 cars took an exit, so the remaining cars that drove through the traffic jam = 30 - 5 = 25
- Total cars that drove through the traffic jam = cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes + cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes
- Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes = 20

Let's represent the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. Then, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20.

Since we know that the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, we can set up the equation:
x + 20 = 25

To solve for 'x', we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
x = 25 - 20
x = 5

So, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first find out how many potted plants she has in total. 

She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she has 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants.

She received 18 new potted plants from the nursery, so now she has 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.

She is giving away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants she will have left, we need to subtract the number of potted plants she is giving away from the total number of potted plants she has. 

So, 98 - 40 = 58.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to find out how many times each friend pressed the doorbell and add them up.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. 
1/4 of 20 is 5, so the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
We know the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, we add up the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell: 
20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 155

The final answer is: 155"
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we need to add up the pages from all his textbooks. 

4 pages (Science) + 20 pages (Social Studies) + 7 pages (History) + 8 pages (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we need to subtract those from the total pages to find out how many pages are left to read.

39 pages - 15 pages = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average per day, we need to divide the remaining pages by the number of days.

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately, and then add them together.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one before bed). Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and 1 before bed, but he replaces one glass of water with a soda at dinner. So, he drinks 3 glasses of water on each weekend day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water on weekends.

Now, let's add the glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends: 20 (weekdays) + 6 (weekends) = 26 glasses of water.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

First, we need to find out how many 3-mile sections are in 42 miles. We can do this by dividing 42 by 3.

42 / 3 = 14

This means there are 14 sections of 3 miles each in the city. Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each section, we can multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section.

14 * 10 = 140

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city."
"To find out how many pieces Poppy placed, we need to calculate a quarter of 1000. 

A quarter of 1000 is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after Poppy placed 250. 

1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left.

Then, her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. 

A third of 750 is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after her mom placed 250. 

750 - 250 = 500 pieces left.

The final answer is: 500"
"To find out how many cookies Cody eats, we need to multiply the number of cookies Amir eats by 3. 

Amir eats 5 cookies, so Cody eats 5 * 3 = 15 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies they eat together, we need to add the number of cookies Amir eats and the number of cookies Cody eats. 

Total cookies = 5 (Amir's cookies) + 15 (Cody's cookies) = 20 cookies.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the inner volume of one box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the dimensions of the box. 

The length of the inner box is 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches (since there are walls on both sides).
The width of the inner box is 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches.
The height of the inner box is 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches.

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the length, width, and height: 
Inner volume of one box = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:
Total inner volume = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Monday and Tuesday: 2 nights * 1 hour per night = 2 hours
- Wednesday: We don't know how many episodes, but each episode is 30 minutes, so let's call the number of episodes x. The total time watched on Wednesday is 30x minutes.
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes) = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 * 1 hour = 2 hours

The total time watched is 2 + 30x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 hours. 

Now, let's convert everything to the same unit (hours) and solve for x:
2 + 30x + 1.5 + 2 = 7
Combine like terms:
5.5 + 30x = 7
Subtract 5.5 from both sides:
30x = 1.5
Divide both sides by 30:
x = 0.05

Since x is the number of 30-minute episodes, we need to convert it to a whole number of episodes. However, 0.05 is not a whole number, but since we can't watch a fraction of an episode, we can round down to 0 episodes or round up to 1 episode. However, since 0.05 is very close to 0, we can assume that Frankie watched 0 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to bake twice as many, so he bakes 2x cookies.

However, he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. This means that the number of cookies he baked minus the 5 he dropped is equal to 110.

So, we can set up the equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get: 2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find the total cost of the gas, we need to multiply the price per gallon by the number of gallons. 

Price per gallon: $3.00
Number of gallons: 10

Total cost of gas = Price per gallon * Number of gallons
Total cost of gas = $3.00 * 10
Total cost of gas = $30.00

Now, we need to find the total cashback rewards. 

Cashback per gallon: $0.20
Number of gallons: 10

Total cashback rewards = Cashback per gallon * Number of gallons
Total cashback rewards = $0.20 * 10
Total cashback rewards = $2.00

Now, we need to subtract the total cashback rewards from the total cost of gas to find the final cost.

Final cost = Total cost of gas - Total cashback rewards
Final cost = $30.00 - $2.00
Final cost = $28.00

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed and multiply it by 2 liters. 

First, let's find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed in 64 seconds. Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find out how many sets of 10 feet she rowed in 64 seconds by dividing 64 by 16 and then multiplying by 2 (since 20 feet is 2 sets of 10 feet).

64 / 16 = 4
4 * 2 = 8

So, Julia rowed 8 sets of 10 feet. Now, we multiply the number of sets by 2 liters to find out how much water the boat took on.

8 * 2 = 16

2. Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

From point 1, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

From point 2, we know that Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Since Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs, the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo is 300 / 50 = 6.

"To find the profit, we need to first find the total cost and the total selling price of the lumber. 

The total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100. 
The total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80. 
The total cost of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. 
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

The total selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $15 = $150. 
The total selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $24 = $120. 
The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles was 2 x 5 = 10.

The next day, more containers were brought in, and the total number of vehicles became 30. To find the number of new containers, we need to subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles.

New containers = Total vehicles - Initial vehicles
New containers = 30 - 10
New containers = 20

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of new containers by dividing the total number of new vehicles by 5.

Number of new containers = New vehicles / 5
Number of new containers = 20 / 5
Number of new containers = 4

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. If we let Lylah's salary be x, then Adrien's salary is 1.3x (since 30% more is the same as multiplying by 1.3).

We also know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000. Since his salary increased by 40% four years later, his new salary is 1.4 times his old salary. So, his new salary is 1.4 * 40000 = $56000.

Since Adrien's new salary is 1.4 times his old salary, we can set up the equation 1.4x = 56000, where x is Lylah's new salary. Solving for x, we get x = 56000 / 1.4 = 40000.

Now that we know Lylah's new salary, we can find Adrien's new salary. Adrien's new salary is 1.3 times Lylah's new salary, so it is 1.3 * 40000 = $52000.

The total salary of the two is the sum of their new salaries, which is 52000 + 40000 = $92000.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour. To find out how many miles she runs in 3 hours, we multiply 10 miles per hour by 3 hours.

10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, we have 4 hours left. In these 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. To find out how many miles she runs in 4 hours, we multiply 5 miles per hour by 4 hours.

5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 20 miles

Now, we add the miles Rosie ran in the first 3 hours to the miles she ran in the remaining 4 hours.

30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

Jennie starts with a pile of 60 letters needing stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of them, which means she stamps 60 / 3 = 20 letters.

Now, there are 60 - 20 = 40 letters left that still need stamps.

We know that after Jennie stamps some letters, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that the 20 letters she stamped were added to the pile of already-stamped letters.

So, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters before Jennie started stamping is 30 - 20 = 10.

- Julia bought a package of spoons.
- Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
- Julia used 3 spoons while making the stew.
- After using the spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons.

We can start by adding the 5 spoons Julia's husband gave her to the total number of spoons Julia had after using 3 spoons. This will give us the total number of spoons Julia had before using any. 

12 (total spoons) + 3 (spoons used) = 15 spoons

Now, we subtract the 5 spoons Julia's husband gave her from this total to find out how many spoons Julia had in the package she bought.

15 (total spoons) - 5 (spoons from husband) = 10 spoons

So, Julia had 10 spoons in the package she bought."

An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we can find the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300

"To find the total profit, we need to first find the total time spent by doctors and the total amount charged to patients. 

The hospital sees 500 people a day, and each patient is seen for 24 minutes. To find the total time spent by doctors, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

24 minutes = 24/60 hours = 0.4 hours

Total time spent by doctors = 500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient = 200 hours

The doctors charge $150 an hour, so the total amount charged by doctors to the hospital = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

The hospital charges $200 an hour to the patients, and the total time spent by patients is the same as the time spent by doctors, which is 200 hours. 

Total amount charged to patients = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

The profit made by the hospital is the difference between the total amount charged to patients and the total amount charged by doctors.

"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands: 
   One third of 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. 
   So, the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands = 27 / 3 = 9 unicorns.

2. Find the number of female Scottish unicorns:
   Two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. 
   So, the number of female Scottish unicorns = 2/3 * 9 = 6 unicorns.

"To find the total cost of Rory's order, we need to calculate the cost of the subs, chips, and cookies, then add the delivery fee and the tip.

The cost of the subs is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
The cost of the chips is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
The cost of the cookies is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
The total cost of the food is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00
The total cost of the order before the tip is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00
The total cost of the order with the tip is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

The final answer is: $29.00"
"To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate how many questions he completed in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

First, we find out how many questions he completed in 8 hours: 8 hours * 5 questions per hour = 40 questions.

Since he completed 40 questions in 8 hours, he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete in the first test.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.

We find out how many questions he completed in 6 hours: 6 hours * 5 questions per hour = 30 questions.

Since he completed 30 questions in 6 hours, he left 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete in the second test.

Now, we add the number of incomplete questions from both tests: 35 + 70 = 105.

The final answer is: 105"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know there are 12 blue gumballs. 

The problem states that there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. This means we need to multiply the number of blue gumballs by 4 and then add 22.

So, we multiply 12 (blue gumballs) by 4: 12 * 4 = 48

Then, we add 22 to the result: 48 + 22 = 70

Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to first find out how many semi-automatic cars there are. 

Total number of cars = 20
Number of automatic cars = 12
Number of manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, we need to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars out of the total number of cars.
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let's say the number of baby bees is x. 
Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2x. 
And since there are twice as many babies as queens, the number of queens is x/2. 

We know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700. So, the sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens is 700. 

We can write the equation: x + 2x + x/2 = 700 

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying the whole equation by 2. 

2x + 4x + x = 1400 

Combine like terms: 7x = 1400 

Now, divide both sides by 7: x = 200 

Now that we know the number of baby bees is 200, we can find the number of worker bees. Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2x = 2 * 200 = 400.

The final answer is: 400"
"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week, we need to calculate how many hours he would work in a week and then multiply that by his hourly wage.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day, if he spent that time working instead, he would work 2 hours a day.

There are 7 days in a week, so he would work 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week.

Jordan earns $10 an hour, so in one week, he would earn 14 hours/week * $10/hour = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of food items and non-food items separately and then add them together.

Food items: 
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
Total cost of food items: 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
Total cost of non-food items: 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
Tax = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of non-food items:
Total cost of non-food items with tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax:
Total cost = 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total income, we need to know how many clients Kim will have. He already has 3 clients and is talking to 5 more, so he will have a total of 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Each client will need 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. So, the total number of bottles of bleach needed is 8 * 2 = 16, and the total number of packs of cloths needed is 8 * 1 = 8.

The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle, so the total cost of bleach is 16 * $2 = $32. The cost of cloths is $5 per pack, so the total cost of cloths is 8 * $5 = $40.

The total expenses are $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72.

Kim's total income is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income: $92 - $72 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to first find out how many pineapples he has in total. 

John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field and there are 100 pineapples per hectare. So, the total number of pineapples John has is 10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples.

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods are in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we divide 12 by 3 to get 4. This means John can harvest his pineapples 4 times in a year.

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples John has by the number of times he can harvest them in a year. 1000 pineapples * 4 = 4000 pineapples.

The final answer is: 4000"
"To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to find the total number of blocks in all three sets.

The first set has 500 pieces.
The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, we add up the number of pieces in all three sets: 
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

The final answer is: 2125"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.
3. The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is 30 (initially left) + 15 (returned) = 45 bees. But 15 bees returned, so the number of bees that are still out is 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees leave the hive. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave the hive.
5. The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is 45 (from steps 1 and 3) + 60 (from step 4) = 105 bees. But 15 bees returned in step 3, so the number of bees that are still out is 60 (left in step 4) + 15 (from step 3) = 75 bees.
6. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. So, 15 bees return.

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to know the total cost of the tickets and add the change she received. 

The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12 and 1 child ticket is $10. 

Total cost of tickets = $12 (adult) + $10 (child) = $22

Since she received $8 in change, we need to add this to the total cost to find out how much she gave the cashier. 

Total money given = Total cost of tickets + Change received
Total money given = $22 + $8
Total money given = $30

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. If Charlie has 12 friends, then we can set up an equation to find out how many friends Dorothy has. Let's call the number of friends Dorothy has ""x"". 

Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can write the equation: 3x = 12. 

To find the value of x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3. 

x = 12 / 3
x = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook. 

Now, we know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, we can multiply 4 by 4 to find out how many friends James has. 

James has 4 * 4 = 16 friends on Facebook.

"To find out who will win the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet for both Steve and Tim. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, we can convert their distances as follows:

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school:

Steve's time: distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes to get home and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will win the race. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time:

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To find out how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires. 

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and 5 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * 25 cents = $2.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and 3 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * 25 cents = $2.25.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and 1 person came by to get their tire inflated. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1.

The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * 25 cents = $0.25.

Now, let's add up the total cost of inflating all the tires: $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

First, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies in each pack: 10 * 6 = 60 cookies

Then, we multiply the total number of cookies by the cost of each cookie: 60 * $0.10 = $6

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so we need to find the change. To do that, we subtract the cost of the cookies from the $10 bill: $10 - $6 = $4

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 french fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total number of fries eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
   Now, the total number of fries eaten by Dave, the seagull, and the pigeons is 21 + 9 = 30.
4. A raccoon ate two thirds of the remaining fries. Let's call the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it 'x'. 
   After the pigeons ate, the remaining fries are x - 30. 
   The raccoon ate two thirds of (x - 30), which is (2/3)(x - 30).
   The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30).
   To simplify this, we can factor out (x - 30) from the expression: (x - 30)(1 - 2/3) = (x - 30)(1/3).
5. After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 behind. 
   So, the remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (x - 30)(1/3) - 1 = 5.
   To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation: (x - 30)(1/3) = 6.
   Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction: x - 30 = 18.
   Add 30 to both sides to solve for x: x = 48.

"To find the total hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours he spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and the total hours he spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays, then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long. So, the total hours he spends on these days is 3 * 1 * 3 = 9 hours per week.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long. So, the total hours he spends on these days is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 hours per week.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, we multiply the total hours per week by 16 to get the total hours for the semester. 

9 hours/week * 16 weeks = 144 hours
8 hours/week * 8 weeks = 64 hours (for Tuesdays and Thursdays, since there are only 8 weeks of Tuesdays and Thursdays in a semester)
Total hours = 144 hours + 64 hours = 208 hours

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is 2 x 12 = 24 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls x 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants x 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes x 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together: 
1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
3360 / 12 = 280 feet

The gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 x 2 = 800 bananas.

The baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 x 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, we add up the total number of bananas needed for all the apes: 400 (monkeys) + 800 (gorillas) + 200 (baboons) = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he's running back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she ran is 200 + (80 * 34) = 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself: 
3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the income she'll lose:
$105 - $90 = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to subtract the total cost of the computer accessories from her budget.

The total cost of the computer accessories is:
€1090 (computer) + €157 (scanner) + €74 (CD burner) + €102 (printer) = €1323

Now, we subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget:
€1500 (budget) - €1323 (total cost) = €177

So, Elvira will have €177 left for her clothing."
"To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets each time she babysits. 

First, we need to find out how many eggs Sandra needs in total. Since she needs 3 eggs for each Spanish flan and she's making 15, we multiply 3 by 15. 

3 * 15 = 45 eggs

Now, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets each time she babysits. 

45 eggs / 9 eggs per babysitting = 5

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs for the Spanish flans.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Brooke's current age is x. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is 2x.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be x + 2 and Seth's age will be 2x + 2.

According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. So, we can set up the equation:

(x + 2) + (2x + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3x + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3x = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 8

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age is 2x, which is 2(8) = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to first find out how much money is twice the amount Ethel has. 

Twice the amount Ethel has is 2 x $8 = $16.

Since Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has, we add $2 to $16. 

$16 + $2 = $18.

So, Jimmy has $18."
"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks in a week. 

There are 7 days in a week. Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, he walks 20 * 5 = 100 miles from Monday to Friday. 

On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, he walks 10 * 2 = 20 miles on the weekends.

Now, we add the miles he walks from Monday to Friday and the miles he walks on the weekends. 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to find the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants, and then add them together.

The hat costs $25.

The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 x $25 = $75.

The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

The total cost of each uniform is $150.

The final answer is: $150"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to multiply the number of spiders by the number of legs each spider has, the number of insects by the number of legs each insect has, and the number of mutant invertebrates by the number of legs each mutant invertebrate has, and then add them all together.

First, let's calculate the total number of legs from the spiders: 
80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs

Next, let's calculate the total number of legs from the insects: 
90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs

Then, let's calculate the total number of legs from the mutant invertebrates: 
3 mutant invertebrates * 10 legs/mutant invertebrate = 30 legs

Now, let's add all the legs together: 
640 legs + 540 legs + 30 legs = 1210 legs

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
2. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
3. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo.
4. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.

From point 3, we know Sally Four is 8 years old. 
From point 2, we know Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.
From point 1, we know Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now we have the ages of three birds: Sally Four (8), Granny Red (16), and Sally Two (19). 
The only bird left is the one at the Caboose, which is Sally Thirtytwo, and we already know she is 8 years old.

The total age of the four birds is 8 + 16 + 19 + 8 = 51.

The final answer is: 51"
"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to first calculate the increased minimum payments for each debt. 

For the student loans, the minimum payment is $300. 50% of $300 is $150, so the increased payment is $300 + $150 = $450.

For the credit card, the minimum payment is $200. 50% of $200 is $100, so the increased payment is $200 + $100 = $300.

For the mortgage, the minimum payment is $500. 50% of $500 is $250, so the increased payment is $500 + $250 = $750.

Now, we need to add up the increased payments for each debt to find the total monthly payment. 

$450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $750 (mortgage) = $1500

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12 to find the total yearly payment.

$1500 * 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes, then add the time it takes to cut one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)

Now, let's calculate the total time to peel all the potatoes:
60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total time to cut all the potatoes:
60 potatoes * (5/60) minutes/potato = 5 minutes

Now, let's add the total time to peel and cut all the potatoes:
90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the total revenue per gallon is 20 x $0.50 = $10.

2. They made a profit of $25, so their total revenue is $25 + (costs) = $25 + ($3 + $2) = $30 (since they spent $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar).

3. Since their total revenue per gallon is $10, the number of gallons they sold is $30 / $10 = 3 gallons.

4. They spent $3 on lemons per gallon, so the total amount they spent on lemons is 3 gallons x $3 = $9.

The final answer is: $9"
"To find the number of Chinese people in the race, we need to subtract the number of Japanese people from the total number of people. 

Total people = 240
Japanese people = 80
Chinese people = Total people - Japanese people
Chinese people = 240 - 80
Chinese people = 160

Now, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we need to subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese people.

Number of girls = Total Chinese people - Number of boys
Number of girls = 160 - 60
Number of girls = 100

1. Zaid earns 6000$ per month.
2. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent: 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$
3. He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel: 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$
4. Total expenses so far: 1500 + 2000 = 3500$
5. Remaining amount after rent and fuel: 6000 - 3500 = 2500$
6. He donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity: 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$
7. Remaining amount after donation: 2500 - 1250 = 1250$

"To find the number of votes the winner got, we need to calculate 3/4 of the total number of students who voted. 

3/4 * 80 = 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, and the winner got 60 votes, the loser must have got the remaining votes. 

Total votes - votes the winner got = votes the loser got
80 - 60 = 20

The loser got 20 votes."
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's call the number of white carnations ""x"". Then the number of red roses is 4x.

She also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. This means the number of white carnations is 200 / 5 = 40.

Now that we know the number of white carnations is 40, we can find the number of red roses. Since the number of red roses is 4 times the number of white carnations, the number of red roses is 4 * 40 = 160.

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 2, we know that two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Since Jan is 30 now, two years ago Jan was 28. Half of 28 is 14. So, two years ago Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Now, we know that Mark was 19 two years ago, so Mark is 19 + 2 = 21 years old now.

From point 1, we know that Jean is two years older than Mark. So, Jean is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

"To find the total time for the well-rounded team, we multiply the time of each runner by 4 since there are 4 runners. 

Well-rounded team's total time = 55 seconds * 4 = 220 seconds

For the less well-rounded team, the first runner runs 60 seconds, the second runner runs 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, the third runner runs 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth runner runs 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. 

Less well-rounded team's total time = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds

To find the difference in time, we subtract the less well-rounded team's time from the well-rounded team's time.

Difference in time = 220 - 162 = 58 seconds

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To find the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3, we need to count the favorable outcomes and divide it by the total possible outcomes. 

There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die. The favorable outcomes for rolling a number greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes. 

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 0.5 or 50%.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to count the favorable outcomes and divide it by the total possible outcomes. 

The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 = 0.5 or 50%. 

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (3/6) * (3/6) = 9/36 = 0.25 or 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities and express it as a percentage. 

The difference is 50% - 25% = 25%.

So, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

"To find out how many apples Jenna picked, we need to find half of the number of apples her mom picked. Since her mom picked 20 apples, we divide 20 by 2 to find Jenna's share.

20 / 2 = 10

So, Jenna picked 10 apples. 

To find the total number of apples they both picked, we add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mom picked.

10 (Jenna's apples) + 20 (mom's apples) = 30

"To find out how many rats are in each cage, we need to first find out how many pieces of straw are distributed among the rats and hamsters. We know that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits, so we subtract that from the total straw distributed among the small rodents.

Total straw distributed among small rodents = 160
Straw distributed among rabbits = 20
Straw distributed among rats and hamsters = 160 - 20 = 140

Now, we know that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's assume the number of rats in each cage is 'r'. Then, the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r.

We also know that there are 10 cages of hamsters and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of straw distributed among hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we can set up an equation to find the total straw distributed among rats and hamsters:

6r + 50 = 140

Now, we can solve for 'r':

6r = 140 - 50
6r = 90
r = 90 / 6
r = 15

So, there are 15 rats in each cage."
"To find out how much Mandy should give to Benedict, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The initial amount is $100.
The monthly interest rate is 2%.

First, we need to find the interest for 1 month:
Interest for 1 month = Initial amount * Monthly interest rate
= $100 * 2% (or 0.02)
= $100 * 0.02
= $2

Now, we need to find the total interest for 3 months:
Total interest for 3 months = Interest for 1 month * 3
= $2 * 3
= $6

Now, we add the total interest to the initial amount to find the total amount Mandy should pay:
Total amount = Initial amount + Total interest
= $100 + $6
= $106

So, Mandy should give $106 to Benedict.

The final answer is: $106"
"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to first find the total cost and total revenue. 

Let's say the number of bags the trader bought is x.

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $30x - $22x = $8x.

We are given that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation $8x = $400.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

So, the trader sold 50 bags."
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of hours he collects peaches by the number of peaches he collects per hour. 

First, we need to convert the hours to minutes because John collects peaches per minute. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is equal to 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches he collects per minute: 180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches.

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we need to first find out how many pounds they need in a week and then divide that by 7.

The ducks need 3.5 pounds of insects each per week.

"To find out how many trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the total number of trees he has after 10 years, and then subtract the trees that die.

Tom starts with 50 trees. 

Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. So, the net change in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8.

After 10 years, the total change in trees will be 8 * 10 = 80.

So, the total number of trees after 10 years will be 50 + 80 = 130.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find out how many trees die, we need to calculate 30% of 130.

30% of 130 is 0.3 * 130 = 39.

So, the number of trees that die is 39.

Now, we subtract the trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years: 130 - 39 = 91.

"To find the number of pink and white flamingos, we need to break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, now there are 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. So, now there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

"To find the cost of 8 pens, we first need to find the cost of one pen. 

Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, we can add the cost of a pencil and an eraser to find the cost of a pen. 

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now that we know the cost of one pen, we can multiply it by 8 to find the cost of 8 pens.

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mark edits 1000 sentences each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. So, the total amount Mark makes from Publisher A is 500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents.

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, Publisher B pays 2 * 5 cents/sentence = 10 cents per sentence. The total amount Mark makes from Publisher B is 500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents.

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the amounts from both publishers: 2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents.

"To find out how much John made that year, we need to calculate his total earnings from his weekly salary and the one-time award.

First, let's calculate his total weekly earnings for the year. Since he makes $2000 a week and there are 52 weeks in a year, his total weekly earnings would be:

2000 * 52 = 104,000

Now, let's calculate his new salary after the 5% raise. A 5% raise means his new salary will be 105% of his old salary. To find 105% of his old salary, we multiply his old salary by 1.05:

2000 * 1.05 = 2100

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the year with the new salary:

2100 * 52 = 109,200

Now, let's add the one-time award of $5000 to his total earnings:

Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she had a total of 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, and each bag had 9 pens, so she bought 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens, and each bag had 6 pens, so she bought 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, let's add the pens she bought to the pens she already had: 32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98 pens.

Janet now has 98 pens."
"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we need to first find the total score she needs for the semester. 

Since there are 6 tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply 6 by 93 to get the total score she needs: 6 * 93 = 558.

Since she can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the first 5 tests. The scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71.

Now, we add up the remaining 4 scores: 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367.

To find the score she needs on the sixth test, we subtract the sum of the 4 scores from the total score needed: 558 - 367 = 191.

So, Brinley needs a score of 191 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To find the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike, we need to calculate the total kilometers for the first four weeks and the total kilometers for the next three weeks, then add them together.

For the first four weeks, Michael rode his bike 5 times a week for 4 weeks. So, the total number of times he rode his bike is 5 * 4 = 20 times. Since he rode 25 kilometers each time, the total kilometers for the first four weeks is 20 * 25 = 500 kilometers.

For the next three weeks, Michael rode his bike 2 times a week for 3 weeks. So, the total number of times he rode his bike is 2 * 3 = 6 times. Since he rode 60 kilometers each time, the total kilometers for the next three weeks is 6 * 60 = 360 kilometers.

Now, we add the total kilometers for the first four weeks and the next three weeks: 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

The final answer is: 860"
"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to find the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples, then add them together.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40g. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Next, we know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. So, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g.

Since there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples together to get the total weight of the bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The final answer is: 2600"
"To find out how many cakes Rose bought in total, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and add them together.

On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 x 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 x 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

The final answer is: 76"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates will cost 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we need to divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups. 

Cost of each cup = Total cost of twenty dozen cups / Number of cups
= $34,800 / 240
= $144

The final answer is: $144"
"To find out how much money Sara needs, we need to add the cost of the jacket and the cost of the shoes. 

Cost of the jacket: $30
Cost of 2 pairs of shoes: 2 x $20 = $40
Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70

Sara already has $10 saved. To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost.

$70 - $10 = $60

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits the kids. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to earn $60, we divide the amount she needs by the amount she earns per babysitting.

$60 / $5 = 12

However, we also need to consider that Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out if she can afford the jacket and shoes by mowing the lawn, we need to compare the amount she earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn.

Since babysitting earns her $5 per time and mowing the lawn earns her $4 per time, it's better for her to babysit. 

But to find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we can divide the amount she needs by the amount she earns per mowing.

$60 / $4 = 15

So, Sara must mow the lawn 15 times to earn enough money to buy the jacket and shoes, but it's better for her to babysit."
"Let's say the number of red chickens is x. Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is x + 2.

The total number of eggs produced by the red chickens is 3x (since each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day), and the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is 5(x + 2) (since each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day).

The total number of eggs collected is 42, so we can set up the equation:

3x + 5(x + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 5x + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8x + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8x = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

x = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens."
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to find the perimeter of the park first. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all its sides. 

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5
Perimeter = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed.

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Day 1: 100 customers
- Day 2: 50 more customers than Day 1, so 100 + 50 = 150 customers
- Total customers by Day 3: 500

To find the number of customers on Day 3, we need to subtract the total customers on Day 1 and Day 2 from the total customers by Day 3.

Customers on Day 3 = Total customers by Day 3 - (Customers on Day 1 + Customers on Day 2)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - (100 + 150)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - 250
Customers on Day 3 = 250

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say the small pool has x gallons of water now. Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, the big pool has 4x gallons of water now.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago, and the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water lost from each pool in 4 minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

So, the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago was x - 16 gallons, and the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago was 2x - 16 gallons.

Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 2(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 16 = 2x - 32

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives:

-16 = -32

This equation doesn't make sense, so let's go back to the original statement that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now. We can set up the equation:

4x = 2(x - 16) + 16

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4x = 2x - 32 + 16

Combine like terms:

4x = 2x - 16

Subtract 2x from both sides:

2x = -16

Divide both sides by 2:

x = -8

This doesn't make sense because we can't have a negative amount of water. Let's go back to the original statement that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now. We can set up the equation:

4x = 2(x + 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4x = 2x + 32

Subtract 2x from both sides:

2x = 32

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 16

So, the small pool has 16 gallons of water now."
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn, which is the cost of the shoes and the belt. 

Total cost = cost of shoes + cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Since Lori earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours to work = 44 hours

"To find the total amount Janeth will pay, we need to calculate the total interest she will pay over 12 months. 

First, let's find the interest she will pay each month. 10% of $2000 is 0.1 x 2000 = $200. 

Since she will pay $165 a month, the interest she will pay each month is $200 - $165 = $35. 

Now, let's find the total interest she will pay over 12 months. $35 x 12 = $420.

Now, let's find the total amount she will pay. $2000 (initial amount) + $420 (interest) = $2420.

Since she will pay $165 a month for 12 months, the total amount she will pay is $165 x 12 = $1980.

Now, let's find the remaining balance. $2420 (total amount) - $1980 (total paid) = $440.

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to know the number of dahlias. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, and there are 4 roses, we can find the number of dahlias by adding 7 to 4.

Number of dahlias = 4 (number of roses) + 7 = 11

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias.

Total number of flowers = 4 (number of roses) + 11 (number of dahlias) = 15

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age is 2 * 21 = 42 years.
3. Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's current age is 3 * 21 = 63 years.

Now, let's calculate their ages in three years:

1. Harriet's age in three years: 21 + 3 = 24 years
2. Zack's age in three years: 42 + 3 = 45 years
3. Adrian's age in three years: 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age of the three in three years, we need to add their ages and divide by 3:

Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored. 

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. 

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

We know that the total points scored by the four students is 251. 
We know that Naomi scored 68 points, Yuri scored 44 points, and Brianna scored 85 points. 
So, the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points. 

To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to subtract the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points scored by all four students. 
So, Jojo scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then convert that to hours.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike receives from his remaining 3 pen pals. Since each of them sends 2 letters a week, and there are 3 of them, the total number of letters he receives is 2 * 3 = 6 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin had 24 french fries initially.
2. Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 x 5 = 10 fries. Now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Ginger gave Griffin some fries, and then Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took (which is 5). So Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. 
5. After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had 9 - 2 = 7 fries.
6. Since Griffin ended up with 27 fries, Ginger must have given Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say the number of fish in each aquarium is x. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2 again:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how much Jean paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the makeup first. 

The makeup artist charges $250 an hour and works 6 hours a day. So, the daily cost is 250 * 6 = $1500.

Since she needs it done 4 times a week, the weekly cost is 1500 * 4 = $6000.

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total cost before the discount is 6000 * 5 = $30,000.

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.1 (which is the same as 10%): 30000 * 0.1 = $3000.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final amount Jean paid: 30000 - 3000 = $27000.

The final answer is: $27000"
"To find out how much each person paid, we need to first find the total amount Isabelle spent on the party supplies. 

Total amount spent = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total amount spent = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total amount spent = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total. 

To find out how much each person paid, we need to divide the total amount spent by 3.

Amount each person paid = Total amount spent / 3
Amount each person paid = $96 / 3
Amount each person paid = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. 

Total weight of onions = 4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, we multiply the total weight by the cost per pound.

Total cost = Total weight * Cost per pound
Total cost = 200 pounds * $1.50/pound
Total cost = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break down the information given:

- On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.
- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.
- Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies
- Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies
- Total calories consumed by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
- Total calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories
- Difference in calories consumed = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to find the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls, the total number of girls in these two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls in the school is 50% of the total number of students. Let's find the total number of students in the school. 

There are 3 classes with 20 students each, so the total number of students is 3 x 20 = 60.

Since 50% of the students are girls, the total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 x 60 = 30.

However, we already know that the total number of girls in the first two classes is 27. So, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the third class has 20 students and 3 of them are girls, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's say the number of cougars he killed today is x. Then, the number of wolves he killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars he killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars he killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12 to find the number of wolves he killed today. 

Solving for x, we get x = 12 / 3 = 4. However, this is the number of cougars, not wolves. We already know that the number of wolves he killed today is 3x, so the number of wolves he killed today is 3 * 4 = 12.

To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we add the number of animals he killed last night and the number of animals he killed today. 

Total animals killed = 10 (wolves) + 15 (cougars) + 12 (wolves) + 12 (cougars) = 49

The final answer is: 49"

"To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we need to find 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 x 30 = 9. 

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Since Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply 21 by 4 to find out how many times Robert went down the slide.

21 x 4 = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"First, we need to find out how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. Since he bought 40 cows and divided them equally among 10 stalls, we need to divide 40 by 10.

40 / 10 = 4

So, Mr. Sylas added 4 cows to each stall. 

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Each stall originally had 20 cows, and now it has 20 + 4 = 24 cows. 

To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8.

24 * 8 = 192

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to find the total number of 10-foot sections and multiply it by the weight of each section. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to find the number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of 8000 from 8000 to find the final weight. 

To find 30% of 8000, we multiply 8000 by 0.3: 8000 * 0.3 = 2400.

Now, we subtract 2400 from 8000: 8000 - 2400 = 5600.

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
2. Andrea has 52 apples, so Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.
4. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, let's count the total number of fruits:
- Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so she has 52 + 24 = 76 fruits.
- Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so he has 44 + 48 = 92 fruits.

Total number of fruits = 76 (Andrea's fruits) + 92 (Jamal's fruits) = 168.

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she's making and then divide that by the number of cups needed per dozen cookies.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. So, the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Since there are 12 cookies in a dozen, we can divide the total number of cookies by 12 to find out how many dozens Carla is making: 66 / 12 = 5.5 dozen.

Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies, we can multiply the number of dozens by 2 to find out how many cups of flour Carla needs: 5.5 * 2 = 11.

So, Carla needs 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first find out how many stitches the collar and rosette take. 

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know that the total number of stitches in the sweater is 1800. We also know that the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches. 

So, the total number of stitches taken by the collar and rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Now, we subtract the total number of stitches taken by the collar and rosette from the total number of stitches in the sweater to find out how many stitches the body and sleeves take together: 1800 - 270 = 1530 stitches.

Since the body takes 900 stitches, the sleeves take 1530 - 900 = 630 stitches together.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches taken by the sleeves by 2 to find out how many stitches each sleeve takes: 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

Now, let's simplify the equation:

6x + 9 = 3x + 27

Subtract 3x from both sides:

3x + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:

3x = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 6

"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to first find out how much space the topaz gemstones take up in the necklace. 

Since each topaz gemstone is one inch long, and there are 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, the total space taken up by the topaz gemstones is 8 inches. 

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the topaz gemstones take up 8 inches, so the space left for the sterling silver beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, so to find out how many beads fit in 17 inches, we need to divide 17 by 0.25 (since 0.25 is one-quarter of an inch).

17 / 0.25 = 68

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

Ann's brother's age in 3 years = 18 + 3 = 21 years

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how much money Kelly has, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has in cents. 

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, 5 quarters will be 5 x 25 = 125 cents. 

Kelly also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, 2 dimes will be 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

Now, let's add the total amount of money Kelly has: 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how much money she has left, we need to subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the number of rows of 5-star, we first need to find the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 x 8 = 24. 

There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 x 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

Since each row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5-star is 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many trucks are needed, we need to divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight that one truck can carry.

First, let's find the total weight of the flagstones: 
80 flagstones * 75 pounds per flagstone = 6000 pounds

Now, let's divide the total weight by the weight one truck can carry:
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds per truck = 3

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 60 miles/hour. 

Speed of the car in the slow lane = 60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Ali has 22 medals. 
Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

It's given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have. 

Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'. Then, we can write the equation: 
x = 10 * 39

To find the total number of medals given out, we multiply 10 by 39. 
x = 10 * 39
x = 390

The final answer is: 390"
"To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we first need to find out how many chocolate bars are available in total. 

There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

4 adults will get 6 chocolate bars each, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. This is 40 - 24 = 16.

There are 8 children, and they will share the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally. So, each child will get 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find out how many hours she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 2.5 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we multiply 2.5 hours by 60 to get the total minutes.

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we divide the total minutes by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals.

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since Susan earns $5 for every 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Mike has 21 points after 3 rounds.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's calculate the points after the fourth round. If a player has over 20 points, they get an extra point.

- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point and still has 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players: 
22 (Mike) + 18 (Jim) + 43 (Tony) = 83

"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to know how many oranges the sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, and he washes 8 oranges. 

The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges, and the sons washed 12 oranges. So, the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3.

"To find the total count of activities, we need to calculate the number of activities for each day and add them together.

Day 1: 
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Total for Day 1: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

Day 2: 
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

"To find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then divide the total amount of rice by that.

First, let's find out how much rice is consumed per day. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 3 meals in a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). So, the total rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 3 = 0.6 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total rice consumed per day is 0.6 kg * 5 = 3 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per day (3 kg).

42 kg / 3 kg = 14 days

Since we want to know how many weeks the rice will last, we need to convert the days to weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide 14 days by 7.

14 days / 7 days per week = 2 weeks

So, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 2 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to first calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he sold bread for 5 days. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. 

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates

Since he was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 working days. His target for the week was 120 crates, but he only had 5 working days. 

To find out his target for 5 working days, we need to divide 120 by 7 (total days in a week) and multiply by 5 (working days). 

Target for 5 working days = (120 / 7) * 5 = 85.71 (approximately)

However, since we can't sell a fraction of a crate, we will consider the target for 5 working days as 85 crates.

Now, let's find out how many crates Sam was off from his target. 

Crates off from target = Target for 5 working days - Total crates sold
= 85 - 65
= 20

So, Sam was 20 crates off from his target for the week. 

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much the desk costs, we need to find out how many times Carmen bids after the other 3 people. Since there are 3 other people and Carmen bids after each of them, she bids 3 times after them. 

The first bid is $200. Each subsequent bid is $50 more than the previous one. 

The bids after the 3 other people will be:
- $200 + $50 = $250
- $250 + $50 = $300
- $300 + $50 = $350

So, the total cost of the desk is the sum of the initial bid and the 3 subsequent bids: 
$200 + $250 + $300 + $350 = $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find out how much John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven, the total cost of driving, and then add the bonus.

1. Total miles driven: Since John goes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 30 * 2 = 60 miles. 
   He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven per year is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15000 miles.

2. Total cost of driving: John is charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of driving per year is 15000 * $2 = $30000.

3. Total bonus: John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus per year is $150 * 12 = $1800.

4. Total cost per year: The total cost per year is the sum of the total cost of driving and the total bonus, which is $30000 + $1800 = $31800.

The final answer is: $31800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider how the pages are arranged after folding. 

When a piece of paper is folded, the front and back sides become one piece. So, for a 32-page tabloid, we need to find the number of pieces of paper that can be made from one sheet of paper.

Since the pages are arranged in a way that the back of one page is the front of another, we can pair the pages together. 

For example, page 1 is on the left back, and page 2 is on the left front. Then, page 32 is on the right back, and page 31 is on the right front. This means that pages 1 and 32, 2 and 31, and so on, are paired together.

Since there are 16 pairs of pages (1-32, 2-31, 3-30, ..., 16-17), we need 16 pieces of paper to make a 32-page tabloid.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to first calculate how much she spent on food and snacks. She spent half of her $50 on food and snacks, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 dollars. 

Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides. So, the total amount she spent is 25 + 10 = 35 dollars.

Now, to find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she had: 50 - 35 = 15 dollars.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Total books = 250
- Unsold books = 50
- Books sold this year = 45
- Books sold in the first year = 2 * Books sold this year = 2 * 45 = 90
- Books sold in the second year = Total books - Unsold books - Books sold this year - Books sold in the first year
= 250 - 50 - 45 - 90
= 65

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
Total money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book
= 65 * 20
= 1300

The final answer is: $1300"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in April. Since there are 4 weeks in April, and he works 5 days a week, he works a total of 4 x 5 = 20 days in April. 

Since he works 10 hours a day, his total hours worked in April is 20 x 10 = 200 hours.

Now, let's calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage. He earns $10 per hour, so his total earnings from his hourly wage is 200 x $10 = $2000.

He also gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. Since there are 4 weeks in April, he gets a total bonus of 4 x $300 = $1200.

Now, let's add his total earnings from his hourly wage and the bonus to find out how much he made in April. $2000 + $1200 = $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"

"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we need to first find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 
Two-thirds of 60 is 60 * (2/3) = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 
60 - 40 = 20 loaves left.

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. 
Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves. 

Since the 10 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, we need to divide 10 by 2 to find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon. 
10 / 2 = 5 loaves sold in the afternoon.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how much weight Sandy loses in a week, we need to divide the total weight Joey loses in 4 weeks by 4. 

Weight Joey loses in 4 weeks = 8 pounds
Weight Joey loses in 1 week = 8 / 4 = 2 pounds

Since Sandy loses the same amount of weight as Joey in 4 weeks, Sandy loses 2 pounds in 1 week. 

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey in 4 weeks, we need to divide the total weight by the weight Sandy loses in 1 week.

Total weight = 8 pounds
Weight Sandy loses in 1 week = 2 pounds
Time it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight = Total weight / Weight Sandy loses in 1 week
Time it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight = 8 / 2
Time it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight = 4

So, the savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. 
The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2. 
So, the savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

1. Cost of business suits: 6 suits * $100 = $600
2. Cost of suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 = $150
3. Cost of flight ticket: 5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500, then add $700 to it = $500 + $700 = $1200

Total cost so far: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the initial amount and subtract the amount he wants to save:

$6000 - $1950 = $4050
$4050 - $2000 = $2050

So, Theo has $2050 left to spend on buying gifts for his business partners."

"Let's break down the information given:

- Let's say the number of players on the defense is x.
- Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.
- There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying the whole equation by 2:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

x = 210 / 7
x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense."

"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

1 (electric pole) : 3 (electric wires) = x (electric poles) : 45 (electric wires)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

1 * 45 = 3x
45 = 3x

Now, divide both sides by 3 to find x:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"To find out how many people left the party, we need to find the total number of people at the beginning and then calculate 1/4 of that number. 

Total people at the beginning = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

1/4 of 40 people = 40 * 1/4 = 10 people

Since 22 men stayed, 25 - 22 = 3 men left. This means 10 - 3 = 7 women left. 

Now, to find out how many women are left, we need to subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women. 

Women left = 15 - 7 = 8

So, 8 women are left at the party.

"Let's break down the problem. 

Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this: 3x + 2 = 26, where x is the number of pencils in each box. 

To find the number of pencils in each box, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 26 - 2, 3x = 24. 

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find x: x = 24 / 3, x = 8. 

So, each box has 8 pencils. 

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 * 8 = 24 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils is 24 + 46 = 70.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each box: 70 / 8 = 8.75. Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To find out how many milliliters weaker the coffee is, we need to calculate the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we need to find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool it by 65 degrees. 

Let's assume the initial temperature of the coffee is 100 degrees (for simplicity). To cool it by 65 degrees, we need to cool it from 100 to 35 degrees. 

Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to find out how many ice cubes are needed: 65 / 13 = 5 ice cubes.

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes will make it 5 x 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which weakens the coffee. 

So, the total weakening effect is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, and they traded 2 old records for 1 new one, then the total number of old records they traded must be double the number of new records they got. 

So, the total number of old records traded is 7 * 2 = 14.

Since there are 5 people, and they all traded the same number of old records, we can divide the total number of old records by 5 to find out how many old records each person brought in.

14 / 5 = 2.8

Since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we can round down to 2.8, but in this case, we can assume that the 5 people must have brought in a total of 14 old records, and the 0.8 is just a remainder."

First, let's find the number of junior programmers. The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. 

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

Now, let's find the salary of senior programmers. They are paid $400 more than junior programmers, who are paid $2000 per month. 

Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, let's calculate the total salary of junior programmers and senior programmers separately.

Total salary of junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Total salary of senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

Now, let's find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.

Total amount of money = Total salary of junior programmers + Total salary of senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $184000

The final answer is: $184000"
"Let's break down the information given:

- At the first bus stop, 5 people got in.
- At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 people got in.
- At the third stop, there were a total of 20 people.

We know that at the third stop, the total number of people is the sum of the people who got in at the first and second stops, and the people who were already on the bus at the terminal. 

Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'. 

At the first stop, the total number of people is x + 5.
At the second stop, the total number of people is (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x - 7 + 8 = x + 1.
At the third stop, the total number of people is x + 1 + 20 = x + 21.

Since we know that at the third stop, there were a total of 20 people, we can set up the equation: x + 21 = 20.

To solve for x, we subtract 21 from both sides of the equation: x = 20 - 21.
x = -1.

However, the number of people cannot be negative, so this solution doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.

Let's re-examine the problem. At the third stop, there were a total of 20 people, which is the sum of the people who got in at the first and second stops, and the people who were already on the bus at the terminal. 

At the first stop, the total number of people is x + 5.
At the second stop, the total number of people is (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x - 7 + 8 = x + 1.
At the third stop, the total number of people is x + 1 + (x + 5 - 7 + 8) = x + 1 + x - 7 + 8 = 2x + 2.
Since we know that at the third stop, there were a total of 20 people, we can set up the equation: 2x + 2 = 20.

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 20 - 2.
2x = 18.
Divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 18 / 2.
x = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how many lollipops Oscar has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school. 
   So, he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

2. He passes 14 out to his friends. 
   So, he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.

3. He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends. 
   He gave 14 lollipops to his friends, so he buys 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops.

4. Now, he has 8 lollipops left and buys 28 more. 
   So, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

5. He eats 3 more lollipops that night. 
   So, he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.

6. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning. 
   So, he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to first find out how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

Since the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can find out how many 3-minute intervals are needed to charge 40% by dividing 40 by 1 (since 1 percentage-point is charged per 3 minutes). 

40 / 1 = 40

So, it will take 40 intervals of 3 minutes each to charge the phone. To find the total time in minutes, we multiply the number of intervals by the length of each interval:

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

120 / 60 = 2 hours

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to first find out how many lollipops she has after her mother gives her 10 more. 

Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so Erin now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to subtract 3 from 17. 

17 - 3 = 14

So, Erin has 14 lollipops left. 

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards they got from their last shopping trip, apply the coupon, and then subtract the rewards and coupon from the total amount spent this shopping trip.

The customer spent $80 last shopping trip, so they got $1 off for every $20 spent. 
$80 / $20 = 4, so they got 4 rewards of $1 each.
4 * $1 = $4 in rewards.

This shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards, so we subtract the rewards from the total amount spent: 
$43 - $4 = $39.

They also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. 
Twice the rewards is 2 * $4 = $8.
So, the coupon took $8 off the price.
$39 - $8 = $31.

The customer paid $31 on this shopping trip.

The final answer is: $31"
"To find out which job pays more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

For Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per year: 2000
- Annual income: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B:
- Annual income: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income before tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- State tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net incomes of both jobs:
Job A: $24,000
Job B: $32,400

Since $32,400 is greater than $24,000, Job B pays more.

To find out how much more Nick will make at Job B compared to Job A, we subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of ruined castles, we need to calculate 40% of 220. 

40% of 220 = 0.4 * 220 = 88

Now, we know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. So, we need to find half of 88.

Half of 88 = 88 / 2 = 44

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the shares after the first year and then after the second year.

First, let's calculate the price of the shares after the first year. The stock price increases by 50%, so the new price will be 150% of the original price. 

Original price = $8
Increase = 50% of $8 = 0.5 * $8 = $4
New price after first year = Original price + Increase = $8 + $4 = $12

Now, let's calculate the price of the shares after the second year. The stock price decreases by 25%, so the new price will be 75% of the price after the first year.

Decrease = 25% of $12 = 0.25 * $12 = $3
New price after second year = Price after first year - Decrease = $12 - $3 = $9

Maria bought 8 shares, so the final value of all her shares will be 8 times the price after the second year.

Final value = 8 * $9 = $72

The final answer is: $72"

"Let's say the number of students in the two equal groups is x. Since the last group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. 

So, we can write the equation: 
x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 
3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 
3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 70

Since the last group has x - 10 students, the number of students in the last group is 70 - 10 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down the information given. Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. 

Let's say the number of cows is x. Then the number of chickens will be 2x (since he has twice as many chickens as cows).

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms: 3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3: x = 20

So, the number of cows is 20 and the number of chickens is 2x = 2(20) = 40.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each and chickens have 2 legs each.

The total number of legs from cows is 20 * 4 = 80
The total number of legs from chickens is 40 * 2 = 80

The total number of legs from all animals is 80 + 80 = 160

3. A pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
4. A pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake.
5. A pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird.

From point 3, we know the pink frog weighs 50 pounds. 

From point 4, we can calculate the weight of the yellow snake: 
Weight of yellow snake = Weight of pink frog + 10 pounds
Weight of yellow snake = 50 pounds + 10 pounds
Weight of yellow snake = 60 pounds

From point 5, we can calculate the weight of the red bird: 
Weight of red bird = Weight of pink frog - 20 pounds
Weight of red bird = 50 pounds - 20 pounds
Weight of red bird = 30 pounds

Since the blue beetle and the green toad weigh the same as the pink frog, they also weigh 50 pounds each.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:
Weight of pink frog = 50 pounds
Weight of blue beetle = 50 pounds
Weight of green toad = 50 pounds
Weight of yellow snake = 60 pounds
Weight of red bird = 30 pounds
Weight of the container = 20 pounds

Total weight = Weight of pink frog + Weight of blue beetle + Weight of green toad + Weight of yellow snake + Weight of red bird + Weight of the container
Total weight = 50 pounds + 50 pounds + 50 pounds + 60 pounds + 30 pounds + 20 pounds

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 cookies a week. 

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies a week.

In total, her son and husband eat 20 + 7 = 27 cookies a week.

Since there are 36 cookies in a bag, and 27 are eaten by her son and husband, Jenny eats the rest. So, Jenny eats 36 - 27 = 9 cookies a week.

"To find the percentage more they are making per day now, we need to first find out how much they used to make per day and how much they make now.

They used to sell 10 tractors a day and made $100 per tractor. So, they used to make 10 x $100 = $1000 per day.

Now, they sell 5 silos a day and make $220 per silo. So, they make 5 x $220 = $1100 per day.

To find the percentage more they are making per day now, we need to find the difference between the two amounts and divide it by the original amount, then multiply by 100.

The difference is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

The percentage more is ($100 / $1000) x 100 = 10%.

"To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to first calculate the total time he spent on all activities. 

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming. 

He also watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

This was 30% of the total time he spent, so we can set up an equation to find the total time: 30% of total time = 15 hours. 

To find the total time, we can convert 30% to a decimal by dividing by 100: 30 / 100 = 0.3. 

Now we can set up the equation: 0.3 * total time = 15. 

To find the total time, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.3: total time = 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time spent sightseeing. John spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so we can set up another equation: 40% of 50 hours = time spent sightseeing.

Converting 40% to a decimal, we get 40 / 100 = 0.4. 

Now we can set up the equation: 0.4 * 50 = time spent sightseeing.

To find the time spent sightseeing, we can multiply 0.4 and 50: 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.

"To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we need to first find out how much money he had left after buying the candy. 

Billy started with $10. He spent $1.5 per pound on candy. Let's call the number of pounds of candy he bought 'x'. The total amount he spent on candy is 1.5x. 

So, the amount of money he had left is 10 - 1.5x.

He then took half of this amount and spent it on gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05, the total amount he spent on gumballs is 0.05 * 40 = $2.

Since he took half of his change, the amount he spent on gumballs is half of the amount he had left after buying the candy. So, 2 = 0.5 * (10 - 1.5x).

To find the value of x, we need to solve the equation: 2 = 0.5 * (10 - 1.5x).

First, we multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the 0.5: 4 = 10 - 1.5x.

Then, we subtract 10 from both sides: -6 = -1.5x.

Now, we divide both sides by -1.5: x = 4.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is:
225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles/day

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the distance it travels in a day (675 miles):
18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days

So, the train goes approximately 26.67 days between services."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed, we need to find the average of the stuffing needed for a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The average is calculated by adding the two amounts and dividing by 2. 

Average stuffing for a collie bed = (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

Stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds = 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.
Stuffing needed for 3 collie beds = 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Total stuffing needed = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total distance John drove to his friend's house, we need to add the detour to the original distance. 

Distance to friend's house = 200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles

Time taken to drive to friend's house = Distance / Speed
Time taken to drive to friend's house = 210 miles / 70 mph
Time taken to drive to friend's house = 3 hours

Now, let's find the time taken to drive back home. 

Distance back home = 240 miles
Speed back home = 80 mph
Time taken to drive back home = Distance / Speed
Time taken to drive back home = 240 miles / 80 mph
Time taken to drive back home = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to drive to friend's house + Time taken to drive back home
Total time taken for the trip = 3 hours + 3 hours
Total time taken for the trip = 6 hours

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to first find the total number of fourth-graders who were present on Friday. 

Total fourth-graders = 96
Absent girls = 5
Absent boys = 4

Total absent students = 5 + 4 = 9

Total present students = Total fourth-graders - Total absent students
Total present students = 96 - 9
Total present students = 87

Now, we know that 43 out of the 96 fourth-graders are girls. So, the number of fourth-grade boys is 96 - 43 = 53.

Number of boys present on Friday = Total present students - Number of girls
Number of boys present on Friday = 87 - (43 - 5)
Number of boys present on Friday = 87 - 38
Number of boys present on Friday = 49

However, we need to find the number of fourth-grade boys who were at Small Tree School on Friday, not the number of boys who were present. Since 4 boys were absent, we need to subtract the absent boys from the total number of boys.

Number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday = Total number of boys - Number of absent boys
Number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday = 53 - 4
Number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday = 49

The final answer is: 49"
"If there are twice the number of boys as girls, that means there are 2 times 6 girls. 2 x 6 = 12. So, there are 12 boys in the park.

Total points required = 42
Points scored in the first test = 15
Points scored in the second test = 18

Points scored so far = 15 + 18 = 33
Points needed for the third test = Total points required - Points scored so far
Points needed for the third test = 42 - 33
Points needed for the third test = 9

"Let's break down the information given:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   Let's call the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting 'x'. 
   So, x = 4 * 3 - 5
   x = 12 - 5
   x = 7
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   So, the number of customers kicked out for physical violence = 3 * 7
   = 21
4. Total number of people kicked out = 50
   Total number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence = 3 + 7 + 21
   = 31
5. Number of people kicked out for other reasons = Total number of people kicked out - Total number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence
   = 50 - 31
   = 19

The final answer is: 19"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

We know that Erin now has 14 points and that she has three times more points than Sara. Sara scored 8 points. 

If Erin has three times more points than Sara, then Erin's points can be calculated as 3 times Sara's points plus Sara's points. 

Erin's points = 3 * Sara's points + Sara's points
Erin's points = 3 * 8 + 8
Erin's points = 24 + 8
Erin's points = 32

Now, we know that Erin now has 32 points, but the question asks how many points Erin had before. Since Erin now has 14 points, we need to find out how many points she had before she scored 14 points.

Let's call the points Erin had before 'x'. Then, Erin's current points (32) are the sum of the points she had before (x) and the points she scored (14). 

x + 14 = 32

To find 'x', we need to subtract 14 from both sides of the equation.

x = 32 - 14
x = 18

So, Erin had 18 points before."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

First, let's find the cost of the picture frames. There are 44 seniors, and each picture frame costs $20. So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 x $20 = $880.

Next, we need to find the cost of etching the logo on each picture frame. The etching costs an additional 20% of the cost of the picture frame. 20% of $20 is 0.2 x $20 = $4. So, the total cost of etching the logo on all the picture frames is 44 x $4 = $176.

Now, let's find the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 x $5 = $10.

Next, we need to find the number of officers. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so 1/4 x 44 = 11 officers.

The cost of the cords for the officers is 11 x $12 = $132.

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords. $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"
"To find the total cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper, we need to first find the cost of the materials. 

The original price of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. If making it yourself saves 20%, that means you save 20% of $400. 

20% of $400 is 0.2 x 400 = $80. 

So, the cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper is $400 - $80 = $320.

The total cost is the cost of materials plus the cost of making it yourself. Since the cost of making it yourself is the same as the cost of materials, the total cost is $320 + $320 = $640.

The final answer is: $640"
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold on each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 x 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday, which is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we need to multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold: 50 x 2 = 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many hours Hallie had dance practice in a week, we need to add up the hours from each day.

On Tuesdays, she had 1 hour of dance practice.
On Thursdays, she had 2 hours of dance practice.
On Saturdays, she had dance practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's night class, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours: 1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours.

"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the value of the faulty equipment and then subtract it from the total amount spent.

The total amount spent on equipment is $400,000. 
40% of the equipment was faulty. 
To find the value of the faulty equipment, we need to calculate 40% of $400,000.

40% of $400,000 = 0.4 x $400,000 = $160,000

Now, we subtract the value of the faulty equipment from the total amount spent to find the value of the functioning equipment.

Value of functioning equipment = Total amount spent - Value of faulty equipment
= $400,000 - $160,000
= $240,000

"To find out how much milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from the half of the sheep that gives 1 kg of milk and the half that gives 2 kg of milk.

Half of the sheep is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

The first half gives 1 kg of milk each, so 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

The second half gives 2 kg of milk each, so 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

Now, we add the milk from both halves: 15 + 30 = 45 kg of milk.

"To find out how many pupils like the color yellow, we first need to find out how many pupils like blue, then how many like green, and then subtract those from the total number of pupils.

Half of the class likes blue, so that's 40 / 2 = 20 pupils who like blue.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20. One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5 pupils who like green.

Now, we subtract the pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils to find out how many like yellow. That's 40 - 20 - 5 = 15 pupils who like yellow.

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest she has to pay and then divide it by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest she has to pay. 

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time
Principal = $3,650
Rate = 10% or 0.10
Time = 5 months

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we need to add the interest to the principal to find the total amount she has to pay.
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since she has to pay an equal amount every month, we need to divide the total amount by the number of months.
Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
Monthly Payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly Payment = $1,095

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to first find out how many silver and gold pesos Anna has. 

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, we add the silver and gold pesos of both Axel and Anna together. 
Total silver pesos = 50 (Axel's) + 100 (Anna's) = 150
Total gold pesos = 80 (Axel's) + 120 (Anna's) = 200

Total number of pesos = Total silver pesos + Total gold pesos = 150 + 200 = 350

"To find the total profit per hour, we need to first find the total amount of money Millie makes per hour and then subtract the cost of supplies per hour.

First, let's find the total amount of money Millie makes per hour. She sells 4 cups per hour at $1 per cup, so she makes 4 * $1 = $4 per hour.

Next, let's find the total amount of money Millie makes per day. Since she has enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups, she has 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade. She sells all of the lemonade, so she makes 36 * $1 = $36.

Now, let's find the cost of supplies per hour. Millie spent $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade, which is enough for 36 cups. Since she sells all of the lemonade, she will make 36 cups in 36 / 4 = 9 hours. So, the cost of supplies per hour is $18 / 9 = $2.

Now, let's find the profit per hour. The profit per hour is the amount of money Millie makes per hour minus the cost of supplies per hour. So, the profit per hour is $4 - $2 = $2.

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to figure out what fraction of his land he sold and what fraction he has left. 

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 of his land left. We know that 2/5 of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares. 

To find the total amount of land he had at first, we can set up an equation: 

(2/5) * x = 12.8 

To solve for x, we need to multiply both sides by 5/2 to isolate x. 

x = 12.8 * (5/2) 
x = 32 

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how many people sang in the performance, we first need to find out how many female members are in the choir. 

Since 50% of the choir members are boys, the other 50% must be girls. 

Number of girls = Total members * 0.5
Number of girls = 52 * 0.5
Number of girls = 26

Now, half the people performing can't make it to the show. This means that half of the girls can't make it to the show. 

Number of girls who can't make it = Number of girls * 0.5
Number of girls who can't make it = 26 * 0.5
Number of girls who can't make it = 13

Now, we need to find out how many girls are performing. 

Number of girls performing = Number of girls - Number of girls who can't make it
Number of girls performing = 26 - 13
Number of girls performing = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22

Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * $2 = $4.

If Dasha bought a ride bracelet for $30, she would have 9 rides. The cost of 9 rides at $4 each would be 9 * $4 = $36.

Since Dasha actually bought tickets, she spent 9 * $4 = $36.

David bought a ride bracelet for $30, and Dasha spent $36. The difference is $36 - $30 = $6.

David saves $6."

"To find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have, we need to add the parts of the ratio together. 5 + 6 = 11. 

Now, we need to divide the total number of popsicles (165) by the sum of the ratio (11) to find out how many popsicles each part of the ratio represents. 165 / 11 = 15.

Since the ratio of Betty and Sam's popsicles is 5:6, we multiply 15 by 5 to find out how many popsicles Betty has, and 15 by 6 to find out how many popsicles Sam has. 

Betty has 15 * 5 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 15 * 6 = 90 popsicles.

The cost of Netflix is $10 a month.

Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling. 20% of $10 is 0.2 x $10 = $2. So, the discount is $2. The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the discount is $10 + $10 - $2 = $18.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $18 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $28.

The cost of the cable package is $60.

To find out how much Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: $60 - $28 = $32.

Erica initially made 20 Valentine's cards.

Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each, so she got 2 x 15 = 30 cards.

She initially had 20 cards, and her dad brought her 30 cards, so she now has 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

She received 17 cards from family and friends.

To find out how many cards she has now, we need to subtract the cards she gave away and add the cards she received. So, she had 50 cards, gave away 29, and received 17, so she now has 50 - 29 + 17 = 38 cards.

Since he works 6 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, he works 6 * 4 = 24 days in a month.

There are 12 months in a year, so he works 24 * 12 = 288 days in a year.

Now, let's multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he works in a year: $50 * 288 = $14400

The final answer is: $14400"
"To find out how many bags of flour Mark needs to buy, we need to divide the total amount of flour needed by the amount of flour in each bag. 

Total flour needed: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
Flour in each bag: 2 cups
Number of bags of flour needed: 12 / 2 = 6 bags

To find out how many bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we need to divide the total amount of milk needed by the amount of milk in each bottle.

Total milk needed: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups
Milk in each bottle: 2 cups
Number of bottles of milk needed: 4 / 2 = 2 bottles

Now, we need to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy. 

Number of bags of flour needed: 6
Number of bottles of milk needed: 2
Difference: 6 - 2 = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much energy Mel uses in a day, we need to multiply the power of the air conditioner (in watts) by the number of hours it's used. 

Power of the air conditioner = 900 watts
Hours used per day = 8 hours

Energy used per day = Power of the air conditioner * Hours used per day
Energy used per day = 900 watts * 8 hours
Energy used per day = 7200 watt-hours or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts)

If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use it for 3 hours a day.

New energy used per day = Power of the air conditioner * New hours used per day
New energy used per day = 900 watts * 3 hours
New energy used per day = 2700 watt-hours or 2.7 kilowatt-hours

To find the energy saved per day, we subtract the new energy used from the original energy used.

Energy saved per day = Original energy used per day - New energy used per day
Energy saved per day = 7.2 kilowatt-hours - 2.7 kilowatt-hours
Energy saved per day = 4.5 kilowatt-hours

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30.

Total energy saved in 30 days = Energy saved per day * 30
Total energy saved in 30 days = 4.5 kilowatt-hours * 30
Total energy saved in 30 days = 135 kilowatt-hours

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the average number of stripes, we need to find the total number of stripes and divide it by the total number of zebras.

There are 2 zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 x 17 = 34 stripes.
There's 1 zebra with 36 stripes.
There's 1 zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes, so that's 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

The total number of stripes is 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.
The total number of zebras is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find out how much money Tyson would spend, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed and then multiply it by their respective prices.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we need to find out how many sandwiches are needed to serve 20 people.

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
The cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Allan initially has 40 cannolis.
2. He has twice as much corn as cannolis, so he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.
3. He bought 60 more cannolis, so now he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.
4. He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.
5. Now, he has 80 (initial corns) + 60 (new corns) = 140 corns.
6. The total number of corns and cannolis is 140 (corns) + 100 (cannolis) = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first find out how many steps he had already taken. 

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

He also took 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, the total steps he took before his jog would be 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. 

10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps.

However, we need to subtract the steps he already took before his jog. 

8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

So, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog. 

The final answer is: 2000"
"To find out how many minutes it will take Toby to read the book, we need to multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page and then divide by the reading speed.

Number of words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words
Time to read the book = 9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so the total time Toby will be at the airport is 30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes.

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, so to find out how many minutes early he will be, we subtract the total time he will be at the airport from the time he has to be there.

Minutes early = 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes"
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked for 40 hours a week and was paid $15 per hour. So, the total amount paid to each employee in May is 40 hours * $15 per hour = $600. 

Since there are 4 weeks in May, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400. 

The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 employees * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. So, 40 - 10 = 30 employees remained. 

The total amount paid to each employee in June is the same as in May, which is $600 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in June, the total amount paid to each employee in June is $600 * 4 = $2400.

The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 employees * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount paid to all employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

The final answer is: $168,000."
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds and the sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off,"" we can break it down as follows:

- 1 pound at $3
- 1/2 pound at $3/2 = $1.50

So, the total cost of 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. She bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items:

- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashells: $1.50
- Magnets: $1
- Total cost: $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount:

$10 - $7 = $3

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework.

The first package of fireworks costs $400. The second package costs twice that much, so it's 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks. To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.20: $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discount is subtracted from the total cost: $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150. To find the total amount spent, we add the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate how many cookies she eats in 30 days and then divide that by the number of cookies her recipe makes.

Shannon eats 2 cookies a night. To find out how many cookies she eats in 30 days, we multiply 2 by 30.

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since Shannon's recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs.

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen cookies

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two conditions.

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50000 candles smell like wet dog, so we multiply 50000 by 0.05.

50000 * 0.05 = 2500 candles that smell like wet dog

Next, we need to find the number of candles that are guaranteed not to explode. 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, so we multiply 50000 by 0.99.

50000 * 0.99 = 49500 candles that are guaranteed not to explode

However, the candles that smell like wet dog are the 1% that are not guaranteed not to explode. So, we need to find 1% of 50000 candles.

50000 * 0.01 = 500 candles that smell like wet dog and are not guaranteed not to explode

Since we are looking for the intersection of the two conditions, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and are not guaranteed not to explode.

The answer is 500."
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the price of one discounted blouse. 

Since the blouses are 30% off, the discount is 30% of the regular price. 

30% of $20 is 0.3 x $20 = $6. 

So, the discounted price of one blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 x $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne does, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The average trees are not specified, so let's call the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees 'x'.
- The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of apples gathered by both sisters:

30 (tallest trees) + 15 (shortest trees) + x (average trees) = 250 (Joanne's total)
60 (tallest trees) + 45 (shortest trees) + 0 (average trees) = 250 (sister's total)

However, we know that the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. So, we can set up the equation:

30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500

Combine like terms:

150 + x = 500

Subtract 150 from both sides:

x = 350

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's break down the problem. 

Let's say the number of camels is C and the number of dromedaries is D. We know that the total number of heads is 180, so we can write an equation: C + D = 180.

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304. Since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump, we can write another equation: 2C + D = 304.

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for C and D by subtracting the first equation from the second equation: (2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180, which simplifies to C = 124.

Now that we know C, we can substitute it into the first equation to find D: 124 + D = 180, so D = 180 - 124 = 56.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days: 
Distance = 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Next, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled over the next two days, which is 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days:
Distance = 30% * 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

Now, let's add the distance Tom traveled on the next day, which is 0 km (he wasn't traveling).

Now, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled during the second week:
Distance = 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Finally, let's add up all the distances to find the total distance Tom traveled:
Total Distance = 800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to find the difference between Stanley's elevation and Oliver's elevation. 

Stanley's elevation is 10,000 feet, and Oliver's elevation is 3,000 feet. 

The difference between their elevations is 10,000 - 3,000 = 7,000 feet.

However, we also need to consider the 4,000 feet that the comb fell. Since Oliver is at a lower elevation than Stanley, he needs to climb up to the point where the comb was initially dropped, not where it landed. 

So, Oliver needs to climb 4,000 feet to reach the point where the comb was initially dropped, and then another 3,000 feet to reach Stanley's elevation. 

The total distance Oliver must climb is 4,000 + 3,000 = 7,000 feet.

"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, 4 boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 x 5 = 20 cats.
   Remaining cats = 50 - 20 = 30 cats

2. Then, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3 and divide by 5.
   3/5 of 30 = (30 x 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18

3. Now, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats.
   Cats left on the rock = 30 - 18 = 12

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different price periods.

The first 6 months cost $8 a month, so that's 6 * $8 = $48.

The next 8 months cost $12 a month, so that's 8 * $12 = $96.

After that, the price increased to $14 a month. Since 2 years is 24 months, we need to find out how many months are left after the first 14 months. 24 - 14 = 10 months.

The cost for the last 10 months is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, we add up the costs for all the periods: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284.

1. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. 
   Let's say the cost of the tattered jeans is x. 
   Then, the cost of the jogger jeans is x - 6.

2. The total cost of both jeans is $28 + (x - 6) = $28 + x - 6 = x + 22.

3. The total savings is $6. 
   Since Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 1/3 * 6 = 2 from the jogger jeans.
   The rest of the savings, which is 6 - 2 = 4, came from the tattered jeans.

4. Since Cole saved $4 from the tattered jeans, the price of the tattered jeans is $28 - $4 = $24.

5. Now we know the cost of the tattered jeans is $24 and the jogger jeans is $24 - 6 = $18.

6. To find out how much more the jogger jeans cost than the tattered jeans, we subtract the cost of the tattered jeans from the jogger jeans: $18 - $24 = -$6.

- Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, so she has a total of 6 bird feeders.
- The store-bought bird feeders attract 20 birds each day.
- The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each day.

Since there are 3 store-bought bird feeders and 3 homemade bird feeders, we can calculate the total number of birds attracted by each type:

- Store-bought bird feeders: 3 * 20 = 60 birds
- Homemade bird feeders: 3 * 30 = 90 birds

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we add the number of birds attracted by the store-bought and homemade bird feeders:

The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.25 (which is 25% as a decimal). 
$4 * 0.25 = $1. 
So the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5. 
The cake costs half of the price of the bagel, which is $4 / 2 = $2.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first figure out how much money he needs to make from selling the cards. Since the ticket costs $100 and he already has $50, he needs to make $100 - $50 = $50 from selling the cards.

Since each card sells for $1.5, we can divide the amount he needs to make ($50) by the price of each card ($1.5) to find out how many cards he needs to sell. 

$50 / $1.5 = 33.33

However, since Kenny can't sell a fraction of a card, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we are looking for the total number of cards he started with, not the number he needs to sell. 

Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards, so the number of cards he sells is 2/3 of the total number of cards. Let's call the total number of cards 'x'. 

The number of cards he sells is 2/3x. We know that he needs to sell 33.33 cards to make $50. 

2/3x = 33.33

To find 'x', we can multiply both sides by 3/2.

x = 33.33 * (3/2)
x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards."
"To find out how many guests got a second hotdog, we need to know that half of the guests were supposed to have two hotdogs. Since there are 36 guests, half of them would be 36 / 2 = 18. 

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that 4 extra guests showed up (40 - 36 = 4). 

Since 18 guests were supposed to have two hotdogs, and there are 4 extra guests, we can assume that the 4 extra guests are the ones who got a second hotdog. 

So, the 18 guests who were supposed to have two hotdogs got a second hotdog, and the remaining guests who were only supposed to have one hotdog are the ones who did not get a second hotdog. 

There are 36 guests in total, and 18 got a second hotdog. So, 36 - 18 = 18 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Since the items are 20% off, we need to find 20% of $165.00 and subtract it from the total cost.

20% of $165.00 is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to find out how much gas was in one container. 

15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, so each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons of gas.

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, we need to find 1/4 of 3 gallons. 

1/4 of 3 gallons is 3 * 1/4 = 3/4 gallon.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we need to convert 3/4 gallon to pints. 

3/4 gallon is equal to 3/4 * 8 = 6 pints.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, which means he spent 99% of his money. 

Since 1% of his money is equal to $0.01, 99% of his money is equal to $5 - $0.01 = $4.99.

The cost of 3 bags of chips is 3 x 40 cents = $1.20. 

So, the amount of money George spent on chips is $1.20. 

Now, let's subtract the cost of chips from the total amount he spent: $4.99 - $1.20 = $3.79.

This is the amount of money George spent on candy bars. 

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find out how many candy bars he bought: $3.79 ÷ 0.75 = 5.0533.

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number.

"To find out how much the remaining cake weighs, we need to first find out how much cake was eaten. 

Rory and her mom each had a piece, so that's 2 pieces in total. Since the cake was cut into 8 pieces, we need to subtract 2 from 8 to find out how many pieces are left. 

8 - 2 = 6

Since each piece weighs the same, we can multiply the number of remaining pieces by the weight of one piece. 

The cake weighs 20 ounces in total, and it was cut into 8 pieces, so each piece weighs 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces.

Now, we multiply the number of remaining pieces by the weight of one piece: 
6 * 2.5 = 15

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to first find out the total number of oranges they have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

They are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, so the total number of people sharing the oranges is 8 (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people
= 56 / 8
= 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and divide it by the number of servings.

Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which costs 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to find out how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater. 

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and it takes Bernadette four times as long as Wayne, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 4 + 5 = 9 minutes before Wayne.

So Bernadette should leave 9 minutes earlier than Wayne."
"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. 

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet because the area is given in square feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so 3 yards is equal to 3 x 3 = 9 feet.

Now we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length x width = area. We can plug in the values we know: 9 x width = 360.

To find the width, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 9: width = 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

Now that we know the width and the length, we can find the perimeter of the room. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 x (length + width). We can plug in the values we know: 2 x (9 + 40) = 2 x 49 = 98 feet.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads they bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, she has 1 x 20 + 2 x 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, she has 3 x 20 + 4 x 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth. To do this, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has: 140 - 60 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature after Marcus bakes and then after he opens the window.

First, let's calculate the temperature after Marcus bakes for 3 hours. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, so in 3 hours it will raise the temperature by 5 * 3 = 15 degrees.

The initial temperature is 40 degrees, so after baking, the temperature will be 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature after Marcus opens the window. The window cools down the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes it is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, it will cool down the house by (2 * 3) = 6 degrees.

The temperature after baking is 55 degrees, so after opening the window, the temperature will be 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

The final temperature is 49 degrees."
"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we need to first find out how long it took him to complete the entire triathlon. 

First, let's convert Jon's times into minutes: 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it took James to swim and bike. 
- James' swim time is 10% faster than Jon's, so it's 40 - (40 * 0.1) = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.
- James' bike time is 5 minutes longer than Jon's, so it's 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it took James to run. 
Total time for James: 180 minutes
Time for James to swim and bike: 36 + 85 = 121 minutes
Time for James to run: 180 - 121 = 59 minutes

The final answer is: 59"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then divide it by 4.

Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to find out how many miles it runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, we need to convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 30 minutes = 30/60 = 0.5 hours). 

Now, we can find the distance the horse runs: distance = speed * time = 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money: $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to calculate the number of eggs in the cases and add the loose eggs. 

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 4 dozen eggs will be 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. 

Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs in total.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, so to find out how many glasses Rozanne can make, we divide the total number of eggs by 5. 

50 / 5 = 10 glasses of eggnog.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out.

10 / 5 = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many points Joey has now, we need to add the points he scored to his initial points. 

Joey's initial points: 214
Points Joey scored: 26
Joey's new points: 214 + 26 = 240

To find out how many points Marcy has now, we need to add the points she scored to her initial points.

Marcy's initial points: 225
Points Marcy scored: 10
Marcy's new points: 225 + 10 = 235

Now, we need to find the difference between Joey's new points and Marcy's new points to see by how many points Joey is winning.

Joey's new points: 240
Marcy's new points: 235
Difference: 240 - 235 = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the salesman's profit, we need to first find the total cost and total revenue.

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. 

The cost per sneaker can be found by dividing the total cost by the number of sneakers:
Cost per sneaker = Total cost / Number of sneakers
Cost per sneaker = $576 / 48
Cost per sneaker = $12

The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each on Monday:
Revenue from Monday sales = Number of sneakers sold * Price per sneaker
Revenue from Monday sales = 17 * $20
Revenue from Monday sales = $340

The rest of the sneakers were sold to a department store for $25 each. To find the number of sneakers sold, we subtract the number of sneakers sold on Monday from the total number of sneakers:
Number of sneakers sold to the department store = Total number of sneakers - Number of sneakers sold on Monday
Number of sneakers sold to the department store = 48 - 17
Number of sneakers sold to the department store = 31

Revenue from department store sales = Number of sneakers sold to the department store * Price per sneaker
Revenue from department store sales = 31 * $25
Revenue from department store sales = $775

Total revenue = Revenue from Monday sales + Revenue from department store sales
Total revenue = $340 + $775
Total revenue = $1115

Total cost = Cost per sneaker * Total number of sneakers
Total cost = $12 * 48
Total cost = $576

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $1115 - $576
Profit = $539

The final answer is: $539"
"To find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each and the four packets with 16 pieces each.

For the six packets with 8 pieces each: 6 * 8 = 48

For the four packets with 16 pieces each: 4 * 16 = 64

Now, we add the total number of crayons from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112

The final answer is: 112"
"Let's break down the information given. 

If you buy a super ticket for $20 and get a $1 extra for popcorn and soda, you save $2 when you buy a regular ticket. 

So, the cost of the regular ticket is $20 - $2 = $18. 

You also know that the cost of the super ticket is $20, which includes the regular ticket price and the $1 extra for popcorn and soda. 

So, the regular ticket price is $20 - $1 = $19. However, we already know the regular ticket price is $18.

"To find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to find out the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's call the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase 'x'. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation 20x = 900. 

To find 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 20. 

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase was $45. 

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. So, the new cost of filling one balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we need to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price. 

The total cost will be the cost of filling one balloon multiplied by the number of balloons. 

Total cost = 65 * 170
Total cost = 11050

The final answer is: 11050"
"To find the average speed, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's find the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 mph x 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

Next, let's find the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 mph x 1 hour
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles
Total Distance = 150 miles

Next, let's find the total time taken:
Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour
Total Time = 3 hours

Now, we can find the average speed:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires and trades 3 for 2 rubies. So, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left. And she now has 2 rubies.

The value of sapphires is $800 each, so 5 sapphires are worth 5 x $800 = $4000.

The value of rubies is $1200 each, so 2 rubies are worth 2 x $1200 = $2400.

To find the total value of her jewels, we add the value of sapphires and rubies together: $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to first find out how many apples they eat in a day. 

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. So together, they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples a day.

Now, we need to multiply the number of apples they eat in a day by the number of days. 

8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one bed is length x width x height = 8 x 2 x 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since there are 10 beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 x 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is 160 x $12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of green cards, we need to calculate 60% of the red cards and add it to the number of red cards. 

60% of 15 is 0.6 x 15 = 9. 
So, the number of green cards is 15 + 9 = 24.

The number of yellow cards is the sum of red and green cards, which is 15 + 24 = 39.

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards: 15 + 24 + 39 = 78.

"To find the number of fairies remaining, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

Then, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw, which is 50 / 2 = 25 fairies. These 25 fairies joined the initial 50 fairies, making a total of 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.

After 10 minutes, 30 fairies flew away. So, the number of fairies remaining is 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add Jennifer's puppies and Brandon's puppies. 

Jennifer's puppies: 8
Brandon's puppies: 12
Total puppies: 8 + 12 = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. 

Jennifer's puppies with spots: 3
Brandon's puppies with spots: 4
Total puppies with spots: 3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to divide the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total puppies with spots / Total puppies) * 100
= (7 / 20) * 100

"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and add them together.

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Total weight of feed = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips.

Number of trips = Total weight of feed / Truck's capacity
= 3400 / 2250
= 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns in a week, we need to calculate the total amount she earns from recycling aluminum cans and plastic bottles.

For aluminum cans: 
Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week. Each can is worth 2 cents. 
So, 3 cans * 2 cents = 6 cents per week from aluminum cans.

For plastic bottles: 
Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week. Each bottle is worth 3 cents. 
So, 5 bottles * 3 cents = 15 cents per week from plastic bottles.

Total earnings per week = 6 cents (aluminum cans) + 15 cents (plastic bottles) = 21 cents per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly earnings by 4 to find the total earnings in a month.
Total earnings in a month = 21 cents * 4 = 84 cents.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to first find out how many plants Toni has. 

Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. Since Frederick has 10 plants, we need to find 60% of 10 and add it to 10.

60% of 10 is 0.6 x 10 = 6. 

So, Toni has 10 + 6 = 16 plants.

Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we need to subtract 7 from 16 to find out how many plants Shondra has.

16 - 7 = 9

"To find out how many cards Miss Maria has in total, we need to calculate the number of basketball cards and baseball cards separately and then add them together.

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck. So, the total number of basketball cards is 6 x 25 = 150.

She has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box. So, the total number of baseball cards is 5 x 40 = 200.

Now, we add the total number of basketball cards and baseball cards together: 150 + 200 = 350.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the remaining cards are 350 - 50 = 300.

If her students got 10 cards each, we need to divide the remaining cards by 10 to find out how many students she has: 300 / 10 = 30.

"To find out how many shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to first calculate the total number of shoes he got and then subtract the shoes he got rid of.

Fireman Frank got 5 pairs of shoes on Monday. Since each pair has 2 shoes, he got 5 * 2 = 10 shoes on Monday.

He got 15 pairs of shoes on Wednesday, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.

He got 30 pairs of shoes on Friday, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

So, in total, he got 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 shoes.

Now, we need to subtract the shoes he got rid of on Saturday, which is 180 shoes.

So, the total number of shoes he will have on Sunday is 100 - 180 = -80 shoes.

However, since you can't have a negative number of shoes, this means that Fireman Frank will not have enough shoes to cover the shoes he got rid of."
"To find out how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake, we need to first find out how many cupcakes she can decorate with the sprinkles she has. 

Since Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles and each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes, we multiply the number of jars by the number of cupcakes each jar can decorate: 6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes.

Now, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake to have at least 48 cupcakes. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per pan: 48 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans.

Theo gave the cashier $10, so the change she received is $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total number of pencils used, we need to find 1/5 of the total pencils in class. 

First, we find the total number of pencils in class: 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils.

Then, we find 1/5 of the total pencils: 300 pencils * 1/5 = 60 pencils.

So, 60 pencils were used in the first two months. 

Now, we need to find the remaining pencils after two months: 300 pencils - 60 pencils = 240 pencils.

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. 

To find 1/3 of the remaining pencils, we divide 240 pencils by 3: 240 pencils / 3 = 80 pencils.

"Let's break down the problem. 

Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is x. 

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. So, the number of cookies he can have is (x/2) + 2.

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. So, we can set up the equation: (x/2) + 2 = 5.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: (x/2) = 5 - 2, which simplifies to (x/2) = 3.

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: x = 3 * 2, which simplifies to x = 6.

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we'll convert the remoras' length from inches to feet. 

1 foot = 12 inches
6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet

There are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. 

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / length of shark) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first find out how many books Sarah bought in total. 

We know that Sarah spent $300 on the books and each book costs $15. 

To find the total number of books, we can divide the total amount spent ($300) by the cost of each book ($15).

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child got.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / Number of kids
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to find the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts and subtract that from the total number of kids in the class.

First, let's find the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for this.

Number of kids allergic to dairy = 9
Number of kids allergic to peanuts = 6
Number of kids allergic to both = 3

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can find the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts as follows:
Total allergic = (Number of kids allergic to dairy) + (Number of kids allergic to peanuts) - (Number of kids allergic to both)
Total allergic = 9 + 6 - 3
Total allergic = 12

Now, we subtract the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything:

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal. To find the new price, we need to calculate 20% of the normal price and add it to the normal price.

20% of $1500 is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. 
The new price of the hotel is $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the cost of the plane tickets plus the cost of the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

"To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon.

Since the razors are buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Heather also has a $2.00 coupon, so she will get a discount of $2.00.

The total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to divide the total cost by the number of razors: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

To find out how many pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by 3: 120 / 3 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the costs for each venue. 

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200, plus $5 for each guest. If there are x guests, the total cost for the first venue is $200 + $5x.

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per guest. If there are x guests, the total cost for the second venue is $25x.

Since we want the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up the equation:

$200 + $5x = $25x

To solve for x, we need to get all the x terms on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting $5x from both sides:

$200 = $20x

Now, we can divide both sides by $20 to solve for x:

x = $200 / $20
x = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let's say David found x insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found x + 7 insects. 

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found. So, Bodhi found 2x insects (since David found half of Bodhi's insects).

We know that together they collected 43 insects. So, the total number of insects they found is the sum of the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi. 

x + (x + 7) + 2x = 43

Combine like terms: 
4x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides: 
4x = 36

Divide both sides by 4: 
x = 9

Since Lily found x + 7 insects, and x is 9, Lily found 9 + 7 = 16 insects.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many yards of yarn they used altogether, we need to find out how many yards Mariah's grandma used and add it to the yards Mariah used.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we multiply 364 by 1/4 to find out how many yards Mariah used.

364 * 1/4 = 364 / 4 = 91 yards

Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn. We multiply 364 by 1/2 to find out how many yards her grandma used.

364 * 1/2 = 364 / 2 = 182 yards

Now, we add the yards Mariah used to the yards her grandma used.

91 + 182 = 273 yards

So, they used 273 yards of yarn altogether."
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the total number of gifts for her friends and add the 10 random gifts.

2 friends want 5 gifts each, so the total number of gifts for these friends is 2 x 5 = 10.

3 friends want 2 gifts each, so the total number of gifts for these friends is 3 x 2 = 6.

The total number of gifts for all friends is 10 + 6 = 16.

Cherrie also bought 10 random gifts.

So, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is 16 + 10 = 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the length of the couch, we need to find the width of the rug first. 

The chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. 
So, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. 
Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. 
So, the couch is 2 feet longer than 16 feet, which is 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

The length of the couch is 18 feet."
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total. 
- 2 packs are strawberry gum.
- 1 pack is grape gum, which costs $2.
- 1 pack is green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum. Since the grape gum costs $2, the green apple gum costs $2 / 2 = $1.

We know that Suzie paid a total of $7 for all 4 packs of gum. 

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as 'x'. Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, the total cost of the strawberry gum is 2x.

The total cost of the grape gum is $2, and the total cost of the green apple gum is $1. 

The total cost of all 4 packs of gum is $7, so we can set up the equation: 
2x + 2 + 1 = 7

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation: 
2x + 3 = 7

Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 
2x = 4

Divide both sides of the equation by 2: 
x = 2

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2."
"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar spent. 

A 2 x 4 gives 200 sticks for $4, so it gives 200 / 4 = 50 sticks per dollar. 
A 2 x 8 gives 400 sticks for $6, so it gives 400 / 6 = 66.67 sticks per dollar (round down to 66.67 since you can't buy a fraction of a stick).

Since 66.67 sticks per dollar is more than 50 sticks per dollar, the 2 x 8 is the cheapest lumber for the most popsicle sticks.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with $24. 
$24 / $6 = 4. 

So, Frederick can buy 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood. 
4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood will give him 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost of the snowshoes, we need to first find out how many snowshoes Mario needs in total. Since each dog has 4 legs and he has 6 dogs, we multiply the number of dogs by the number of legs per dog to get the total number of legs. 

6 dogs * 4 legs per dog = 24 legs

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the total number of snowshoes needed. 

24 legs / 2 = 12 snowshoes

Now, we multiply the total number of snowshoes by the cost per pair to get the total cost.

12 snowshoes * $12.00 per snowshoe = $144.00

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To find out how much Janet spends on bus trips in a week, we need to multiply the cost of one bus trip by the number of bus trips she takes in a week. 

Cost of one bus trip: $2.20
Number of bus trips in a week: 5

Total weekly cost of bus trips: $2.20 * 5 = $11.00

Now, we need to find out how much she would save by buying a weekly bus pass for $20. 

Weekly bus pass cost: $20
Weekly bus trip cost: $11.00

Amount saved: $20 - $11.00 = $9.00

The final answer is: $9.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The farm has 30 cows.
- The zoo has 20 sheep.
- The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
- The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Total animals in the farm and the zoo: 40 + 80 = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. We are told that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. 

Let's assume the number of onions Sophia bought is x. Then, the number of potatoes Sophia bought is also x. 

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, the number of onions Rose bought is 4x and the number of potatoes Rose bought is also 4x. 

We are given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. So, we can set up the following equations:

4x = 12 (for onions)
4x = 4 (for potatoes)

Solving the first equation, we get x = 12 / 4 = 3. 

Now, we know that Sophia bought 3 onions and 3 potatoes. 

To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add the number of onions and potatoes together: 3 + 3 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many days Andy has to lose the weight, we need to calculate the number of days between December 31st and July 19th. 

December has 31 days, and from January to July, there are 6 months with 30 days each (January, March, May, April, June, and July has 19 days). 

31 + 30*6 + 19 = 205 days

Now, we need to find out how many calories Andy needs to burn in total to lose 30 pounds. Since he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 calories to lose 30 pounds.

30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories

Now, we need to find out how many calories he needs to burn each day to reach his goal. 

105,000 calories / 205 days = 511.22 calories per day

So, Andy needs to have a calorie deficit of 511.22 calories per day to reach his goal."
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to first calculate how much he earned in a week. Since he works 7 days a week, and he earns $30 per day, we multiply 7 by 30.

7 * 30 = 210

Now, we know Gerald earned $210 in a week. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from the amount he earned.

210 - 100 = 110

So, Gerald has $110 left."
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we need to first find out how many kilometers she will run. 

Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, we multiply 0.25 km by 8.

0.25 km * 8 = 2 km

Now that we know Hannah will run 2 km, we can multiply the distance by the amount of water she needs to drink per kilometer.

2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

So, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Julie started with $500.
2. She spent 20% of $500 on clothes. 
   20% of $500 = 0.2 x $500 = $100
   So, she spent $100 on clothes and had $500 - $100 = $400 left.
3. Then, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.
   25% of $400 = 0.25 x $400 = $100
   So, she spent $100 on CDs and had $400 - $100 = $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's say the cost of the lot is x. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can set up the equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we multiply x by 3: 3 * 30,000 = 90,000

The house cost $90,000."
"To find the profit, we need to first find the total cost and the total selling price of the canvas bags.

Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. So, the total number of bags is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack = 40 bags. The total cost is 40 bags * $4 per bag = $160.

She sold each bag for $8. So, the total selling price is 40 bags * $8 per bag = $320.

The profit is the total selling price minus the total cost. So, the profit is $320 - $160 = $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to find out how many punches he threw per round and then multiply it by the total number of rounds.

First, let's find out how many punches Joe throws per round. Since he throws 25 punches per minute and a round lasts 3 minutes, we can divide 25 by 3 to get the number of punches per round.

25 punches per minute / 3 minutes per round = 25 / 3 = 8.33 punches per round

Since there are 5 rounds in total, we can multiply the number of punches per round by the total number of rounds.

8.33 punches per round * 5 rounds = 41.65 punches

Since we can't throw a fraction of a punch, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the total number of punches, so we will keep the decimal.

The total number of punches Joe threw is 41.65."
"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first find out how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, Josh made 36 / 4 = 9 cookies.

Since Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, we multiply the number of cookies Josh made by 2. So, Kelsie made 9 * 2 = 18 cookies.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we need to find the total amount of money Ali has. He has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. 
   Total money = (4 * $10) + (6 * $20) 
   Total money = $40 + $120 
   Total money = $160

2. Ali gives his sister half of the total money. 
   Half of the total money = $160 / 2 
   Half of the total money = $80 

   Now, Ali has $160 - $80 = $80 left.

3. Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. 
   3/5 of the remaining money = (3/5) * $80 
   3/5 of the remaining money = $48 

   Now, Ali has $80 - $48 = $32 left.

The final answer is: $32"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how long it takes Rob to shingle a house in minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we need to convert 2 hours to minutes. 

1 hour = 60 minutes
2 hours = 2 x 60 = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. So, first, we need to find double the time it takes Rob. 

Double the time it takes Rob = 2 x 120 = 240 minutes

Now, we need to add 40 minutes to this time to find out how long it takes Royce. 

Time it takes Royce = 240 + 40 = 280 minutes

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to first find out how many cups of raisins she has left after dividing the bag among the three recipes. 

Since she divides the bag equally among the three recipes, she will divide the 27 cups of raisins by 3. 

27 cups / 3 = 9 cups of raisins per recipe.

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make with 9 cups of raisins. A batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. 

To find out how many batches she can make, we need to divide 9 cups by 3/4 cup. 

To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of 3/4 is 4/3.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house. 

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then 5 people can paint half a house in 5 / 5 = 1 day. 

Since 5 people can paint half a house in 1 day, they can paint a whole house in 2 days (because 2 halves make a whole).

Now, we need to convert the number of days into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 2 days is equal to 2 x 24 = 48 hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.
5. To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have: 20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 64 (Jenna's sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 152.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5 + 8) years old, which is (x + 13) years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

2(x + 13) - 5 = x + 13

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 26 - 5 = x + 13
2x + 21 = x + 13

Subtract x from both sides:

x + 21 = 13

Subtract 21 from both sides:

x = -8

Since age can't be negative, this is not a valid solution. Let's try another approach.

Let's say Jame's current age is x. In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5 + 8) years old, which is (x + 13) years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

2(x + 5) = x + 13 + 5

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 10 = x + 18

Subtract x from both sides:

x + 10 = 18

Subtract 10 from both sides:

x = 8

Now that we know Jame's current age, we can find his age in 5 years and his cousin's age in 8 years.

Jame's age in 5 years: 8 + 5 = 13
Jame's cousin's age in 8 years: 8 + 13 = 21

The difference between their ages in 8 years is 21 - 13 = 8.

However, we need to find the difference between their current ages. 

Jame's current age: 8
Jame's cousin's current age: 8 - 5 = 3

The difference between their current ages is 8 - 3 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
2. The cost of the computer is $1,100.
3. The cost of the printer is $400 less than the computer.

First, we need to find the cost of the printer. Since the cost of the printer is $400 less than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer to get the cost of the printer.

Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
Cost of the printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of the printer = $700

Now that we know the cost of the printer, we can find the total cost of the computer and the printer.

Total cost of the computer and the printer = Cost of the computer + Cost of the printer
Total cost of the computer and the printer = $1,100 + $700
Total cost of the computer and the printer = $1,800

Since the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400, we can find the total cost of the 2 monitors by subtracting the total cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost of all three items.

Total cost of the 2 monitors = Total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer - Total cost of the computer and the printer
Total cost of the 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,800
Total cost of the 2 monitors = $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we need to find the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2.

Cost of one monitor = Total cost of the 2 monitors / 2
Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. There are 20 kids in total, divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. So, the number of girls and boys is 20 / 2 = 10 each.

2. The boys brought back 60 shells each, so the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

3. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 60 shells.

4. To find the number of shells brought by the girls, we need to calculate 4 * 60 = 240.

5. Now, we add the number of shells brought by the boys to the number of shells brought by the girls: 600 + 240 = 840.

6. Since there are 10 girls, we need to divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by 10 to find the number of shells brought by each girl: 840 / 10 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Nick had twice as many candies as George.
2. Let's say George had x candies initially. Then Nick had 2x candies.
3. George ate 5 candies, so he has x - 5 candies left.
4. We are given that George has 3 candies left, so x - 5 = 3.
5. To find the value of x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation: x = 3 + 5, x = 8.
6. Since Nick had 2x candies initially, and x = 8, Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how old Alyana is, we need to subtract 4 from Chenny's age. 
Chenny is 10 years old, so Alyana is 10 - 4 = 6 years old.

To find out how old Anne is, we need to add 2 to Alyana's age. 
Alyana is 6 years old, so Anne is 6 + 2 = 8 years old.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to find the thickness of each book and add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it's 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it's 2 x 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all the books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188

The final answer is: 188"
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she can make in a month.

Emma made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

Total vlogs made = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Now, subtract the total vlogs made from the total vlogs she can make in a month.

Total vlogs she can make in a month = 72
Total vlogs made = 54

Vlogs left to make = 72 - 54 = 18

So, Emma should make 18 vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

"To find out how much you paid, first, you need to calculate the 20% tip. 

20% of $50 is 0.20 x 50 = $10.

Then, you add the tip to the original bill: $50 + $10 = $60.

Since your wife wants to split the check evenly, you will pay half of the total amount: $60 / 2 = $30.

So, you ended up paying $30."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much money the eldest boy initially got. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we divide $18 by 3 to find out the initial share of the eldest boy.

Initial share of the eldest boy = $18 / 3 = $6

2. The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so we add $5 to the initial share.

New amount after adding $5 = $6 + $5 = $11

3. The following day, he added another $10 to his share, so we add $10 to the new amount.

New amount after adding $10 = $11 + $10 = $21

4. He then spent $8 from his total, so we subtract $8 from the new amount.

Amount after spending $8 = $21 - $8 = $13

5. He then tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8. To triple the amount, we multiply it by 3.

Final amount = $13 * 3 = $39

The final answer is: $39"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Let's say Elvis saves x dollars per day in the first half of the month. Since there are 15 days in the first half of April (1-15), he will save 15x dollars in the first half.

In the second half of the month, he wants to save twice as much daily as he saves in the first half, so he will save 2x dollars per day. Since there are 15 days in the second half of April (16-30), he will save 15 * 2x = 30x dollars in the second half.

The total amount Elvis wants to save is $1125. So, the sum of the savings in the first and second half should be equal to $1125. 

15x + 30x = 1125

Combine like terms: 
45x = 1125

Divide both sides by 45: 
x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

So, Elvis has to save $25 per day in the first half of the month.

The amount he has to save for each day in the second half of the month is twice the amount he saves in the first half, which is 2 * 25 = 50 dollars."
"To find out how much change Verna received, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought and subtract that from the $20 she gave.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits:

- 3 apples at $1.50 each: 3 x $1.50 = $4.50
- 5 oranges at $0.80 each: 5 x $0.80 = $4.00
- 6 peaches at $0.75 each: 6 x $0.75 = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Since Verna gave $20, we subtract the total cost from $20 to find the change: $20 - $13.00 = $7.00

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to first find out how much money each of them will get after completing 20 tasks.

Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, so for 20 tasks, he will get 20 x $0.8 = $16.

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, so for 20 tasks, she will get 20 x $0.5 = $10.

Now, we need to find the difference between what Jairus and Jenny get. 

$16 (Jairus) - $10 (Jenny) = $6

So, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars. 

We know that the total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation: x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms: 5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5: x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4(20) = 80 dollars.

The final answer is: $80"
"To find out how many miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total distance he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works.

Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the distance he walks each day is 3 miles * 2 = 6 miles.

Now, we multiply the daily distance by the number of days he works: 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice: 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters
2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once: 26 / 2 = 13 letters
3. So, the total number of letters written so far is 52 + 13 = 65 letters
4. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written: 65 letters * 2 = 130 letters

Now, we add the total number of letters written in the last step to the previous total: 65 + 130 = 195

"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first find out how many toys he needs in total. 

Since James's play set has 80 toys, a play set five times larger than James's would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys. 

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a play set five times larger than James's. Let's call the number of toys Jonathan currently has ""x"". Then, the total number of toys he needs is x + 2.

Since the total number of toys he needs is 400, we can set up the equation: x + 2 = 400.

To solve for x, we need to subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: x = 400 - 2.

x = 398.

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys. 

The final answer is: 398"

"Let's break down the information given:

- When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
- When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as it takes him to swim a mile in cold water.

First, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. 

Twice as long as it takes him to swim a mile in cold water is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes.
2 minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold water and 3 miles in warm water.

In cold water, it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile. So, to swim 3 miles, it will take him 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

In warm water, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile. So, to swim 3 miles, it will take him 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

"To find out how many cups Juan needs to reduce, we first need to find out how many cups he currently drinks. 

Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, and we don't know the daily recommended amount, let's call it x. So, Octavia drinks x/2 cups. 

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

We are told that the daily recommended amount is 4 cups. Since Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake to 4 cups, we need to find the difference between what he currently drinks and the recommended amount.

The difference is 5x - 4 cups.

However, we still don't know the value of x. To find x, we need to know the amount Octavia drinks. Since we are not given that information, we can assume that the question is asking for a general answer in terms of x.

But, if we assume that the question is asking for a specific answer, we can assume that the daily recommended amount is 8 cups (since 4 cups is half of 8 cups). 

If the daily recommended amount is 8 cups, then Octavia drinks 8/2 = 4 cups. 

Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, Juan drinks 10 * 4 = 40 cups.

The difference between what Juan currently drinks and the recommended amount is 40 - 8 = 32 cups.

So, Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake by 32 cups.

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. So, the cost of bread for 1 sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30. 

The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00. So, the cost of cheese and condiments for 1 sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00.

The total cost for 1 sandwich is $0.30 (bread) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $3.30.

The revenue from selling 1 sandwich is $7.00.

The net profit for 1 sandwich is $7.00 (revenue) - $3.30 (cost) = $3.70.

The net profit for 10 sandwiches is $3.70 x 10 = $37.00.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removing the old carpet is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installing the new carpet is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost is the sum of the costs of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11332.

The final answer is: $11332"
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide by the number of days.

Total number of birds = 50 (day 1 and 2) + 0 (day 3) + 120 (day 4 and 5) + 20 (day 6) + 90 (day 7)
Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90
Total number of birds = 280

Number of days = 7

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / Number of days
Average number of birds per day = 280 / 7
Average number of birds per day = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the given steps.

1. The starting value of the number train is 20.
2. Half of the starting value is 20 / 2 = 10.
3. The starting value plus half the number is 20 + 10 = 30.
4. The resulting value is divided by 5, so 30 / 5 = 6.
5. The resulting value is multiplied by the starting value minus 12, so 6 * (20 - 12) = 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To find out how many cards the brother has, we need to subtract 3 from the number of cards the boy has. 

The boy has 5 cards. 
Brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, to find the total number of cards they have together, we need to add the number of cards the boy has and the number of cards his brother has.

Total cards = 5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7

"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to find the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference is 468 - 450 = 18.
The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Now, we need to find the temperature that Maggie should set the oven to in order to get 520 degrees. Let's call this temperature x. Since the oven is off by 4%, we can set up the equation:

x - (4% of x) = 520

To find 4% of x, we multiply x by 0.04 (since 4% = 4/100 = 0.04).

So, the equation becomes:
x - 0.04x = 520

Combine like terms:
0.96x = 520

Now, divide both sides by 0.96:
x = 520 / 0.96
x = 541.67

So, Maggie should set the oven to 541.67 degrees."
"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to add the length of both movies in minutes. 

First, we convert the length of the first movie to minutes: 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 1 hour and 30 minutes is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.

Next, we convert the length of the second movie to minutes: 2 hours is 120 minutes, and adding 5 minutes to that makes 125 minutes.

Now, we add the length of both movies: 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

The final answer is: 215"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price.

Herb's house price = $76,000
30% of Herb's house price = 0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800
Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
= $76,000 - $22,800
= $53,200

Now, we need to find the combined value of the two houses.
Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
= $76,000 + $53,200
= $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

To find the total number of utensils brought by the two, we need to add the number of cups and dishes brought by Judy and her friend.

Judy brought 12 + 24 = 36 utensils (12 cups + 24 dishes).
Her friend brought 40 + 44 = 84 utensils (40 cups + 44 dishes).

The total number of utensils brought by the two is 36 + 84 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many pairs of contacts Pete will need, we need to multiply the number of days he needs contacts by the number of pairs he uses per day. 

Pete needs contacts for 45 days and uses 1 box (90 pairs) for 45 days. So, he uses 90/45 = 2 pairs per day.

Since he buys 2 boxes, he will have 2 * 90 = 180 pairs of contacts.

The discount is 10% off the original price of $100.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $100 * 0.10 = $10.

The discounted price of 1 box is $100 - $10 = $90.

To find the cost per pair, we divide the discounted price by the total number of pairs: $90 / 90 = $1 per pair.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate how much each of them earned and then find the difference.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so she worked a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. In total, John worked 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Tabitha agreed to pay $10 an hour, so Jill earned 3 * $10 = $30 and John earned 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many calories Hannah burns in total, we need to add the calories burned from aerobics and running. 

Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times 100 ml is needed.

Total calories burned: 1600
Divide by 200: 1600 / 200 = 8

So, Hannah needs to drink 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water. 

The final answer is: 800"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B. 
Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is B - 0.01B = 0.99B. 
Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of green jelly beans is B + 0.01B = 1.01B.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500. So, the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans is 4500. 
0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 
Combine like terms: 2.99B = 4500 
Divide both sides by 2.99: B = 1500 

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans is 1500, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans. 
Number of red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1500 = 1485 
Number of green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515 

To find the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans: 1515 - 1485 = 30

"To find the total number of people attending, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Alex invites 100 people via email, and each invited person says they will also invite 2 friends. So, the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

2. Alex then calls 10 of her friends to invite them too. So, the total number of people invited by Alex is 300 + 10 = 310.

3. 8 of the friends she called say they will be bringing their spouses. So, the total number of spouses is 8.

4. To find the total number of people attending, we add the number of people invited via email, the number of friends Alex called, and the number of spouses. total_people = 300 + 10 + 8 = 318.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet off the ground. 

The beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall and doubles its height every day. 

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find out how many grams of protein are in 200 grams of mushrooms. 

We can do this by dividing 200 grams by 100 grams (the weight of a cup of mushrooms) to find out how many cups of mushrooms John eats per day. 

200 grams / 100 grams = 2 cups per day

Now, we know that 1 cup of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein. So, we can multiply the number of cups John eats per day by the amount of protein in each cup to find out how many grams of protein he gets per day.

2 cups per day * 3 grams of protein per cup = 6 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the amount of protein John gets per day by 7 to find out how many grams of protein he gets per week.

6 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Let Jerry's current age be x. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can write an equation: x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get: -x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get: x = 10

So Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13

"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown, and then subtract the deposit he has already paid.

The base price of each implant is $2000. Since he needs 2 implants, the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

He wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the implants and the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

He has already paid a deposit of $600. So, the amount he still needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since he makes $15 per hour at work, to find out how many hours he needs to work to pay for the dental work, we need to divide the amount he still needs to pay by his hourly wage.

$3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let the smallest angle be x. 
One angle is twice the smallest angle, so it's 2x. 
One angle is three times the smallest angle, so it's 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. 
One angle is 2x, which is 2 * 30 = 60 degrees. 
One angle is 3x, which is 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

8 quarters = 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
6 dimes = 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has:
200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:
345 cents / 5 cents = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how many pounds he makes in an hour, we divide 120 by 2. 

120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour for Ruiz.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour. To find out how many pounds Marissa makes in an hour, we multiply 60 by 3/4.

60 * (3/4) = 45 pounds per hour for Marissa.

Now that we know how many pounds each person makes in an hour, we can find out how many pounds they make in 12 hours. 

Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.

Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

"To find out how much Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract that from the $50 he has.

First, let's find the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there's a 30% off sale, we need to find 30% of $60 to calculate the discount. To do this, we multiply $60 by 0.30 (which is the decimal form of 30%). 

$60 * 0.30 = $18

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost. 

$60 - $18 = $42

Since the sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional tax to the final cost. 

To find out how much money Joe will have left, we subtract the final cost from the $50 he has.

"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total amount of water used in a year and then multiply it by the cost of a gallon of water.

Gary does laundry twice a week, so he does laundry 52 times in a year (since there are 52 weeks in a year). Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used in a year is:

52 weeks/year * 2 loads/week * 20 gallons/load = 2080 gallons/year

Now, we multiply the total amount of water used in a year by the cost of a gallon of water:

2080 gallons/year * $0.15/gallon = $312/year

The final answer is: $312"
"To find out how much Scarlett spent, we need to add up the costs of all the items she bought.

1. The aquarium cost $10.00.
2. 2 bags of rocks cost 2 x $2.50 = $5.00.
3. 3 pieces of coral cost 3 x $2.00 = $6.00.
4. 20 fish cost 20 x $0.50 = $10.00.
5. The fish food cost $2.00.

Now, let's add up all the costs: 
$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

"To find the number of students, we need to first find the total number of seats in the auditorium. 

Total number of seats = Number of rows * Number of seats in each row
Total number of seats = 4 * 18
Total number of seats = 72

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. 
Number of seats occupied by administrators = Total number of seats * (1/4)
Number of seats occupied by administrators = 72 * (1/4)
Number of seats occupied by administrators = 18

Now, we need to find the number of remaining seats after the administrators occupied their seats. 
Remaining seats = Total number of seats - Number of seats occupied by administrators
Remaining seats = 72 - 18
Remaining seats = 54

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. 
Number of seats occupied by parents = Remaining seats * (1/3)
Number of seats occupied by parents = 54 * (1/3)
Number of seats occupied by parents = 18

Now, we need to find the number of seats occupied by the students. 
Number of seats occupied by students = Remaining seats - Number of seats occupied by parents
Number of seats occupied by students = 54 - 18
Number of seats occupied by students = 36

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim chews at school, we need to divide the total school hours by 2. 

8 hours / 2 = 4 pieces of gum

He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces. 

Total pieces of gum chewed = 4 (at school) + 2 (on the way home and after dinner) = 6 pieces

He started with 20 pieces of gum. 

Remaining gum = 20 - 6 = 14 pieces

His sister asks for half of the remaining gum. 

Half of 14 = 14 / 2 = 7 pieces

Jim gives his sister 7 pieces, so he has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces left.

"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach and then subtract the baseball coach's total from the basketball coach's total.

The baseball coach bought 9 new baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent by the baseball coach is 9 x $3 = $27.

The basketball coach bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent by the basketball coach is 8 x $14 = $112.

Now, we subtract the baseball coach's total from the basketball coach's total: $112 - $27 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we need to first find out the total number of flowers in the garden. 

There are 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row. So, the total number of flowers is 10 x 20 = 200.

Since only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we need to find 4/5 of 200. 

To find 4/5 of 200, we multiply 200 by 4 and then divide by 5. 

200 x 4 = 800
800 / 5 = 160

So, 160 flowers have bloomed in Arianna's garden.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s. 

1 Mb = 1000 kb, so 1 kb = 1/1000 Mb. 

Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kb/s. To convert it to Mb/s, we multiply 20 by 1/1000. 

20 * (1/1000) = 0.02 Mb/s

Now, we need to find out how many seconds are in an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute. 

60 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 3600 seconds

Now, we multiply Ashley's speed in Mb/s by the number of seconds in an hour to get her speed in Mb/hour.

0.02 Mb/s * 3600 s/hour = 72 Mb/hour

"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately and then add them together.

The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. 
So, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is 10 * 3 = 30.

The remaining days in the week are 7 - 3 = 4 days. 
On each of these days, the tow truck pulled 10 - 4 = 6 cars.

The total number of cars towed on the remaining days is 6 * 4 = 24.

Now, we add the total number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining days to get the total number of cars towed that week.
Total number of cars towed = 30 + 24 = 54

The final answer is: 54"
"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to subtract his current height from the required height and then divide by his growth rate.

The required height is 4 feet, which is equal to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches).

Adam's current height is 40 inches.

So, the difference between the required height and Adam's current height is 48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches a year, we can divide the difference by his growth rate to find out how many years it will take for him to be tall enough:

8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit first. 

1. First, let's find the total cost of the cars: 10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000
2. The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so the cost for James is 70% of the total cost: $250,000 * 0.7 = $175,000
3. The selling price of the cars is the original price: 10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000
4. The profit is the selling price minus the cost: $250,000 - $175,000 = $75,000
5. James got a 10% commission on the profit: $75,000 * 0.1 = $7,500

James made $7,500."
"To find the number of men who can stay upright, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply 100 by 0.25 to get the total number of riders who can stay upright: 
100 * 0.25 = 25

Now, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women, we multiply 25 by 0.6:
25 * 0.6 = 15

Since the remaining riders are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:
25 - 15 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to find the price of the gold and silver jewels first.

The price of a diamond Jewell is $2000. 
The price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond Jewell. 
So, the price of a gold Jewell = (4/5) * $2000 = $1600.

The cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold. 
So, the price of a silver Jewell = $1600 - $400 = $1200.

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the gold, silver, and diamond jewels.
Total price = $1600 + $1200 + $2000 = $4800.

The final answer is: $4800"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
- He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.
- He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps together: 
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to find the time it takes for the distance between them to decrease to 0.

Let's denote the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob as 't' hours.

Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, the distance between them decreases at a rate of 55 - 70 = -15 miles per hour (since Tom is moving faster than Bob).

The distance between them decreases at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find the time it takes for the distance to decrease to 0, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

We know the distance (75 miles) and the rate at which the distance is decreasing (-15 miles per hour). We can rearrange the formula to solve for time:

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 75 miles / 15 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to first find out how many fish Darren caught. 

Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, Darren caught 17 - 6 = 11 fish.

Then, Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so Tommy caught 11 + 3 = 14 fish.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many classes Manny can miss, we need to find out the maximum cost per class that his parents are willing to pay. 

Since his parents are willing to pay $10 per class, and there are 10 classes, the total cost should be 10 * $10 = $100. 

Manny already paid $60 for signing up, so the remaining cost is $100 - $60 = $40. 

Since there are 10 classes, and the total remaining cost is $40, we can divide the remaining cost by the cost per class to find out how many classes he can miss. 

$40 / $10 = 4

So, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 4"
"If Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, then Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production for Jewel is 50 * 7 = 350 customers, and the total weekly production for Julie is 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for both Jewel and Julie is 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"

"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to first find the cost of one apple and one orange. 

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the cost of 1 apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30. 

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of 1 orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can find the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges. 
5 apples will cost 5 x $1.30 = $6.50.
5 oranges will cost 5 x $1.10 = $5.50.

The total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we need to multiply the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

"To find out how much Tim will make in a year, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his $20,000 a month salary. 
5% of $20,000 is 0.05 x $20,000 = $1,000. 
So, his new monthly salary will be $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

Next, let's calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary. 
Half of $20,000 is $10,000.

Now, let's add the bonus to his new monthly salary. 
$21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000.

Finally, let's multiply his new monthly salary by 12 to find out how much he will make in a year.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first month, Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. This means her sales from green hats in the first month were 2 times the sales from red hats, which is 2 x $400 = $800.

So, the total sales in the first month were $400 (red) + $800 (green) = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. To find the sales in the second month, we multiply the total sales of the first month by 3/4: (3/4) x $1200 = $900.

- It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so it took her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork.
- Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. 
  First, we need to find the combined cooking time of pork and rice, which is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes.
  Then, we need to find half of 80, which is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we need to add up the cooking times of rice, pork, and beans to find the total cooking time.
Total cooking time = 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost of each mixture, we need to multiply the weight of each type of nut by its price per pound and then add the two amounts together.

For the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- Cost of almonds: 1/2 * $10 = $5
- Cost of walnuts: 1/3 * $15 = $5
- Total cost: $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- Cost of almonds: 1/5 * $10 = $2
- Cost of walnuts: 1/3 * $15 = $5
- Total cost: $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
$10 - $7 = $3

"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. 

Since sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, we can set up the following equation for the total number of legs: 
4S + 2G = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, so we can set up the following equation: 
S + G = 20

We can solve the second equation for G: 
G = 20 - S

Now, substitute G in the first equation: 
4S + 2(20 - S) = 70

Expand the equation: 
4S + 40 - 2S = 70

Combine like terms: 
2S + 40 = 70

Subtract 40 from both sides: 
2S = 30

Divide both sides by 2: 
S = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut. 

First, let's find the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 x $5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee for a week. 

The cost of the more expensive coffee is $6 per pound, so the total cost of the coffee is 7 x $6 = $42.

The cost of the donut is $2.

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To find out how much the apple pie cost, we need to subtract the total cost of the items Gus bought from the $20.00 he spent. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought: 
2 bags of chips for $2.00 each = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Adding the cost of the bucket of fried chicken: $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00
Adding the cost of the bottle of soda: $12.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the items from the $20.00 Gus spent: 
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers he delivers to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers he delivers in a day.

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)

"To find out how many recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total hours of class time and then divide it by 1.5 hours per recipe.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total hours per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

Since the class lasts for 6 weeks, the total hours of class time is 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours.

Now, we divide the total hours by 1.5 hours per recipe to find the number of recipes learned: 48 hours / 1.5 hours/recipe = 32 recipes.

"To find the number of math teachers, we first need to find the number of history teachers. Since 60% of the teachers are history teachers, we can calculate this by multiplying 150 by 0.6.

150 * 0.6 = 90

So, there are 90 history teachers. To find the number of math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers.

150 - 90 = 60

There are 60 math teachers. 

Now, we need to find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day. Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours they sleep.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Aurelia has $120.
2. Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia. 
   To find Kassidy's money, we multiply Aurelia's money by 3/4.
   Kassidy's money = 3/4 * 120 = 90 dollars.
3. Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy.
   To find Rayna's money, we add 60 to Kassidy's money.
   Rayna's money = 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, let's add their money together: 
Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

To find out how much each would have if they share equally, we divide the total money by 3 (the number of people).
Total money / 3 = 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This means if Sally has x books, Janey has 2x + 3 books. 

We are given that Janey has 21 books. So, we can set up the equation: 2x + 3 = 21.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 21 - 3, which simplifies to 2x = 18.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find the value of x: x = 18 / 2, which simplifies to x = 9.

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. 

1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = 240 inches.

Now, we need to find the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches). 

600 - 240 = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days it will take to reach 600 inches.

360 / 30 = 12

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. 
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs 8 more toys for these dogs. 
   Total toys needed so far: 4 (initial toys) + 8 (new dogs) = 12 toys
3. When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Since there were 8 dogs initially, there are now 8 * 2 = 16 more dogs.
   Total dogs now: 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (initial new dogs) + 16 (new dogs) = 28 dogs
   James needs 28 toys for these dogs. 
   Total toys needed so far: 12 (previous toys) + 28 (new dogs) = 40 toys
4. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys.
   Total toys needed: 40 (previous toys) - 3 (toys for the 3 dogs that left) = 37 toys

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, but we don't know how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. Let's call the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has ""x"". So, Max has x + 12 cookies.
4. We already know Max has 73 cookies, so x + 12 = 73. To find x, we subtract 12 from both sides: x = 73 - 12, x = 61. The Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.
5. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, and Max has 73 cookies. So, Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.
6. To find the total number of cookies, we add the number of cookies each person has: Katarina (68) + Max (73) + Cookie Monster (61) + Summer (96) = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let the original length of the dress be x cm. 

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the new length after extension is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, she adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress, so the final length is 1.5x + 20.

We are given that the final design is 140cm long, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 140 - 20
1.5x = 120

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 1.5:

x = 120 / 1.5
x = 80

Time in turtle mode = 1 hour = 60 minutes
Time in rabbit mode = 40 minutes

Since Chris mowed half of the lawn in each mode, we need to multiply the time for each mode by 0.5 (half).

Time in turtle mode = 60 * 0.5 = 30 minutes
Time in rabbit mode = 40 * 0.5 = 20 minutes

Now, we add the time for both modes to get the total time.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's say the age of one triplet is x. Since there are three triplets, their combined age would be 3x. 

One twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so the age of that twin would be x + 7. The other twin's age would be x + 7 as well, since they are twins and have the same age.

The combined age of all of them is 44, so we can write the equation: 3x + (x + 7) + (x + 7) = 44

Combine like terms: 3x + 2x + 14 = 44

Combine the x terms: 5x + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides: 5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5: x = 6

Now that we know the age of one triplet is 6, we can find the age of one twin. The twin is 7 years older than the triplet, so the twin's age is 6 + 7 = 13.

"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. Then, 60% of x is 0.6x. Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, we can say that the heartworm check is 0.6x. 

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. So, we can write the equation: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 0.6x from both sides of the equation: x - 0.6x = $40. This simplifies to 0.4x = $40.

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.4 to solve for x: x = $40 / 0.4 = $100.

So, the total bill is $100. 

Since John brought $125 with him, he will leave with $125 - $100 = $25.

Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. So, she will set off 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks in her backyard.

Now, we add the number of fireworks Hannah will see from the city (120) and the number of fireworks she will set off in her backyard (15). 120 + 15 = 135.

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we need to first find the total number of people, then multiply it by the number of drinks and snacks each person buys.

The total number of people is Aiden and his 12 friends plus 7 more friends, which is 1 + 12 + 7 = 20 people.

Each person buys 2 drinks and 3 snacks, so each person buys a total of 2 + 3 = 5 items.

The total number of items bought is 20 people * 5 items/person = 100 items.

Since each item costs $2, the total amount spent is 100 items * $2/item = $200.

The final answer is: $200"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.
3. The three trucks combined can haul 11,600 pounds of gravel.

To find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we need to subtract the total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the combined capacity of all three trucks.

Combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks = 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds
Capacity of all three trucks = 11,600 pounds

Now, subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the capacity of all three trucks to find Gary's truck capacity:
Gary's truck capacity = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds

The final answer is: 2800"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Since there are 8 males and 6 females, the total number of people is 8 + 6 = 14.

Each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

The total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

The total number of dumplings eaten by all people is 18 (by females) + 32 (by males) = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten by all people, which is 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much money Gerald had initially, we need to find out how much he got from the $100. The ratio of Gerald to Julia is 3:2, so the total parts are 3 + 2 = 5. 

Gerald's share is 3 out of 5 parts, so we can find his share by multiplying 100 by 3/5. 

Gerald's initial amount = (3/5) * 100 = 60

Now, we know Gerald spent $10 on a book. To find out how much he has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from his initial amount.

Gerald's remaining amount = 60 - 10 = 50

The final answer is: $50"
"To find out how fast the turtle crawls, we need to know the speed of the cat and the ratio of the turtle's speed to the cat's speed. 

The cat's speed is 15 feet/second. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, the turtle's speed is 15 / 5 = 3 feet/second.

Now, we need to find out how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. To do this, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time: 3 feet/second * 40 seconds = 120 feet.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many hours they have to fundraise, we need to first find out how much they need to raise per hour. 

They need to raise a total of $6300 and have already raised $2100. So, the amount they still need to raise is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

Since they have already raised money for 3 hours, we need to divide the remaining amount by the number of hours they have already worked to find out how much they raise per hour. 

$4200 / 3 hours = $1400 per hour.

Now, we need to divide the total amount they need to raise ($6300) by the amount they raise per hour ($1400) to find out how many hours they need to fundraise in total.

$6300 / $1400 = 4.5 hours.

So, they have to fundraise for 4.5 more hours to reach their goal.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To find the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percent of the river's total water used by the city, and then subtract the percent used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. 

80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes, so we need to find 20% of 40% (since 100% - 80% = 20%). 

20% of 40% is 0.2 x 0.4 = 0.08 or 8%.

So, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for industrial purposes. 

To find the percent used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract 8% from 40%: 40% - 8% = 32%.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to first find out how much she charges for 1 week and then multiply it by 2.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Alex charges $12 per day, we can multiply 7 days by $12 to find the weekly charge.

7 days * $12/day = $84/week

Now, we multiply the weekly charge by 2 to find the total charge for 2 weeks.

$84/week * 2 weeks = $168

"To find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to find the rate at which the factory makes chocolate and vanilla ice cream per hour.

For chocolate ice cream, the factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours. To find the rate per hour, we divide 100 quarts by 2 hours: 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours. To find the rate per hour, we divide 50 quarts by 4 hours: 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we need to find the total quarts made in 48 hours. For chocolate ice cream, we multiply the rate per hour (50 quarts) by the number of hours (48): 50 * 48 = 2400 quarts. For vanilla ice cream, we multiply the rate per hour (12.5 quarts) by the number of hours (48): 12.5 * 48 = 600 quarts.

To find the total quarts made in 48 hours, we add the quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts.

The final answer is: 3000"
"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the discount.

Cost of 5 croissants: 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
Cost of 4 cinnamon rolls: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
Cost of 3 mini quiches: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
Cost of 13 blueberry muffins: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Total cost of all items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00:
10% of $50.00 = 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
$50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To find out how many scoops Erin can buy, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 scoops of ice cream. 

2 scoops of ice cream cost 2 x $1.50 = $3.00. 

Since Erin gets 1 scoop free with every 2 scoops she buys, she can get 2 scoops for $3.00. 

Erin has $6.00, so she can buy 2 sets of 2 scoops for $3.00 each. 

2 sets of 2 scoops will be 2 x 2 = 4 scoops. 

She will get 4 scoops of ice cream.

"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate how many pieces they eat in two weeks and subtract that from the initial amount.

There are 7 days in a week, so in two weeks, there are 7 * 2 = 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger, we subtract the amount Ginger has from the amount Amy has: 58 - 44 = 14.

"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store and compare it to the cost of picking them.

First, let's calculate the cost of picking the blueberries:

Cost to pick blueberries = $20 (initial cost) + ($1.5 per pound * 30 pounds)
Cost to pick blueberries = $20 + $45
Cost to pick blueberries = $65

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store:

Cost at the store = $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds
Cost at the store = $75

Now, let's find the difference in cost:

Difference in cost = Cost at the store - Cost to pick blueberries
Difference in cost = $75 - $65
Difference in cost = $10

So, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries instead of buying them at the store.

The final answer is: $10"

New price of each computer = $700 + $70 = $770

Now, we need to find the total amount of money they paid to buy 500 computers at the new price.
Total amount = New price of each computer x Number of computers
Total amount = $770 x 500

"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to first find out how many slices were eaten in total. 

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 5 people in total, 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas. 

2/3 of 3 pizzas is (2/3) * 3 = 2 pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, 2 pizzas have 2 * 12 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, 2 friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. 

3/4 of 2 pizzas is (3/4) * 2 = 1.5 pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, 1.5 pizzas have 1.5 * 12 = 18 slices.

In total, 24 + 18 = 42 slices were eaten. 

Since there were 5 pizzas in total, and each pizza has 12 slices, 5 pizzas have 5 * 12 = 60 slices.

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe into inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet into inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, we get 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. We can write the equation as:

100 = 9x + 10

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

90 = 9x

Now, we divide both sides by 9 to find the value of 'x':

x = 90 / 9
x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."
"To find out how many windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the total number of windows she smashes from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find out how many windows she smashes from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each. A quarter of the students' cars' windows are smashed, so we multiply 64 by 1/4 (which is the same as 0.25) and then multiply by 4 (the number of windows per car).

64 * 0.25 * 4 = 64 * 1 = 64

So, Hannah smashes 64 windows from students' cars.

Next, let's find out how many windows she smashes from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each. Three-fourths of the teachers' cars' windows are smashed, so we multiply 32 by 3/4 (which is the same as 0.75) and then multiply by 2 (the number of windows per car).

32 * 0.75 * 2 = 32 * 1.5 = 48

So, Hannah smashes 48 windows from teachers' cars.

Now, let's add the number of windows she smashes from students' cars and teachers' cars together.

At 8:00, 2/5 of 5000 people had voted by midday. 
2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by midday.

So, the remaining people at midday are 5000 - 2000 = 4000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
2/3 * 4000 = 2666.67 (round down to 2666 since we can't have a fraction of a person).

So, the number of people who voted by 16:00 is 2000 (by midday) + 2666 = 4666.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 5000 - 4666 = 334.

"To find out how many birds were scared away, we need to calculate 1/3 of 12. 

1/3 of 12 is 12 / 3 = 4.

So, 4 birds were scared away. 

Now, we need to subtract 4 from the original number of birds. 

12 - 4 = 8.

Then, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. 

8 + 20 = 28.

The final answer is 28."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that there are 2 classes with a total of 80 students. Since each class has the same number of students, we can divide 80 by 2 to find the number of students in each class.

80 ÷ 2 = 40 students in each class

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we can multiply the total number of students in each class by 40% (or 0.4).

Number of girls in each class = 40 x 0.4
= 16 girls in each class

Since there are 40 students in each class and 16 are girls, we can find the number of boys in each class by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students.

Number of boys in each class = 40 - 16
= 24 boys in each class

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the number of slices Mara had after adding 3 slices to the 2 slices already on the plate, we add 2 + 3 = 5 slices.

Then, Mara tripled the number of slices she currently has, so we multiply 5 by 3, which is 15 slices.

After eating 2 slices, Mara had 15 - 2 = 13 slices left.

Finally, her friend stole 5 slices, so we subtract 5 from 13, which is 8 slices.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we need to add up the total number of animals and then divide by 7 (the number of days in a week).

First, let's add up the total number of animals:
- Dogs: 8
- Cats: 5
- Birds: 3
- Horses: 12
Total animals = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28

Now, let's divide the total number of animals by 7:
28 / 7 = 4

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week."
"To find the profit, we need to first find the total cost and the total value of the cards.

The total cost is 3 packs * $1800 = $5400.

The total value of the cards is $4000 + $1000 + (30 * $50) = $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

The profit is the total value of the cards minus the total cost, which is $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

The final answer is: $1100"
"To find the total cost for each amusement park, we need to calculate the cost for adults and children separately and then add them together.

For the first amusement park:
- Cost for adults: 2 adults * $26 = $52
- Cost for children: 2 children * $12 = $24
- Total cost for the first amusement park: $52 + $24 = $76

For the second amusement park:
- Cost for adults: 2 adults * $14 = $28
- Cost for children: 2 children * $10 = $20
- Total cost for the second amusement park: $28 + $20 = $48

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two amusement parks to determine how much they will save:
- Difference in cost: $76 - $48 = $28

The final answer is: $28"
"To find out how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, we need to first find out how much he saves a day. 

The vendor used to buy 500 tomatoes a day for $.5 each, so he spent 500 * $.5 = $250 a day. 

Now, he buys the tomatoes for $.4 each, so he spends 500 * $.4 = $200 a day.

To find out how much he saves a day, we subtract the new cost from the old cost: $250 - $200 = $50 a day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily savings by 7 to find the weekly savings: $50 * 7 = $350.

The final answer is: $350"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Sean has 56 marbles. 
Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean, so Cal has 56 * 2 = 112 marbles. 
Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so Carl has 56 * 4 = 224 marbles.

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together: 112 + 224 = 336.

"To find out how many groups are needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of students per group. 

First, we need to divide 54 students by 6 groups to find out how many students per group. 

54 ÷ 6 = 9 students per group.

Now, we know that 54 students are to be separated into 12 groups. To find out how many students per group, we divide 54 by 12.

- Weekends: 2 days * 100 chairs/day = 200 chairs
- Total chairs rented in a week: 300 + 200 = 500 chairs

"To find out how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to subtract the broken items from the total number of items he sent.

First, let's find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff sent. 

8 dozen glasses = 8 x 12 = 96 glasses
4 dozen plates = 4 x 12 = 48 plates

Total items sent = 96 glasses + 48 plates = 144 items

Now, let's subtract the broken items from the total items sent.

Broken glasses = 10
Broken plates = 6

Total items broken = 10 + 6 = 16

Now, let's subtract the total broken items from the total items sent.

Glasses left = 96 - 10 = 86
Plates left = 48 - 6 = 42

So, Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates now.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. 

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 x 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading her small stickers.

Now, she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 x 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading her large stickers.

Now, she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, she gets 20 x 3 = 60 small buttons from trading her large stickers.

Now, let's count the total number of buttons she has: 
- 27 small buttons from trading small stickers
- 20 large buttons from trading large stickers
- 60 small buttons from trading large stickers

Total buttons = 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's say the number of votes against the new regulation is x. Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice as many as the votes against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of people on the council is 33. This means the sum of the votes in favor and against the new regulation is 33. 

So, we can write the equation: x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

Since x is the number of votes against the new regulation, the number of votes in favor is 2x. 

2x = 2 * 11 = 22

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that 2/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and we know there are 18 Pomeranians. To find the total number of puppies, we can set up an equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total Puppies = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much Jayden needs to buy the camera, we first need to calculate how much money he has after Ava gives him her allowance. 

Jayden initially had $70. Ava gave him half of her $90, which is $45. 

So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: 

$200 - $115 = $85.

So, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera."
"Let's break down the information given:

- The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250.
- The first house needs 1/2 of what the second house needs.
- The third house needs double what the first house needs.

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as x. Then, the first house needs x/2 cases, and the third house needs 2*(x/2) = x cases.

Since the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250, we can set up the equation:

x + (x/2) + x = 250

To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms:

5x = 500

Now, divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

Since the third house needs x cases, and x = 100, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to add up the cost of the items each person bought. 

Leila bought 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so the total cost for Leila is 3 x $2 = $6.

Jack bought 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so the total cost for Jack is 5 x $1 = $5.

Chase bought 1 head of lettuce at $3, so the total cost for Chase is $3.

Now, we add up the costs: $6 (Leila) + $5 (Jack) + $3 (Chase) = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"To find out how many pears George has, we need to calculate 45% of 200 bananas and add it to the number of bananas. 

45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas. 

Now, we add 90 to the number of bananas: 200 + 90 = 290

Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we also need to add the number of pears to the number of bananas. To find the total number of pears, we need to add 90 to the number of bananas. 

Total number of fruits = 200 (bananas) + 290 (pears) = 490

The final answer is: 490"
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the money she had and then divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar.

Marissa had $80 and spent $20 on the ball, so she had $80 - $20 = $60 left.

Each candy bar costs $5, so we divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar: $60 / $5 = 12.

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

12"
"To find out how much money Sam needs to spend, we need to first find out how many kilograms of oranges he needs to make 4 liters of juice. Since he needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice, he would need 5 * 4 = 20 kilograms of oranges to make 4 liters of juice.

Since each kilogram of oranges costs $3, the total cost of 20 kilograms of oranges would be 20 * 3 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how many books Ahmed read, we need to divide the number of books Ezra read by 2. 

Ezra read 300 books, so Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we need to add the number of books Ezra read to the number of books Ahmed read, and then add the 150 more books Ezra decided to read.

Total books read by Ezra and Ahmed = 300 + 150 = 450
Total books read by Ezra and Ahmed after Ezra reads 150 more = 450 + 150 = 600

The final answer is: 600"
"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then add them together.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for the hours she worked is 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. 

Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Monday is $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her total earnings for the hours she worked is 2 hours * $15/hour = $30.

Since she teaches more than 3 classes on Monday, but not on Wednesday, she earns an additional $5 for Monday, but not for Wednesday. So, her total earnings for Wednesday is $30.

Now, we add the total earnings for both days: $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold.

The company sold 5 of each of the 4 vanilla scents, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 x 4 = 20.

The company sold 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 x 8 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold. 

20 (vanilla scents) - 16 (fruity scents) = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to first calculate how much money he makes from selling the eggplants. 

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he makes from selling the eggplants is 20 x 3 = $60.

Now, we know that Bennet wants to make a total of $135. Since he already made $60 from selling the eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

He has 25 ears of corn, so to find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we need to divide the total amount of money he needs to make from selling the corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25).

$75 ÷ 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find out how much time Tatiana spends playing soccer, we need to first find out how much time she has left after reading and playing video games. 

She has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, so in total, she has 7 + 5 = 12 hours.

She reads for 3 hours, so she has 12 - 3 = 9 hours left.

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, which is 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours.

So, she has 9 - 3 = 6 hours left for soccer.

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we need to divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time and multiply by 100.

(6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps:

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils and gave 1/2 of them to Brandon. 
   1/2 of 50 is 50 / 2 = 25 pencils given to Brandon.
   So, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

2. Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie.
   3/5 of 25 is 25 * (3/5) = 15 pencils given to Charlie.
   So, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils. 

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the total time he spends driving and the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Jack to drive to the museum. 
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since he drives to the museum and back, we need to multiply the time by 2.
Total driving time = 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours

Now, we add the time he spends at the museum to the total driving time.
Total time = Total driving time + Time at the museum
Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 10 hours

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many wheels Henry will need, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles. 

For the cars, he needs 4 wheels for each car, and there are 57 cars. So, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228.

For the motorcycles, he needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle, and there are 73 motorcycles. So, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146.

Now, we add the total number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles: 228 + 146 = 374.

Since Henry has a box with 650 wheels, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the total number of wheels he has: 650 - 374 = 276.

The final answer is: 276"
"To find the discount amount, we need to calculate 20% of the original price of the laptop.

20% of $1000 = 0.20 x $1000 = $200

Final price = Original price - Discount
Final price = $1000 - $200
Final price = $800

So, you have to pay $800."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the series movies, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies.

First, let's find the number of series movies. A third of the movies are in series, so we multiply 600 by 1/3.

600 * (1/3) = 200 series movies

Since series movies cost $6, we multiply the number of series movies by the cost.

200 * $6 = $1200

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies. We subtract the series movies from the total.

600 - 200 = 400 remaining movies

40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we multiply 400 by 0.4.

400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

Older movies cost $5, so we multiply the number of older movies by the cost.

160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are normal movies. We subtract the number of older movies from the remaining movies.

400 - 160 = 240 normal movies

Normal movies cost $10, so we multiply the number of normal movies by the cost.

240 * $10 = $2400

Now, we add the cost of the series movies, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies to find the total cost.

$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

The final answer is: $4400"

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To find the distance, we need to calculate the distance they drove and the distance they hiked, then add them together.

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Their driving speed is 50 miles per hour. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's find the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they drove is 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

Next, let's find the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they hiked is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Now, let's add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked to find the total distance to their vacation spot. 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: 330"
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them gets from enemies, berries, and the timer.

Let's assume Emma's score from enemies is x. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's score from enemies will be x + 8.

Emma's score from berries is 3 (since she collects 3 berries), and Ava collects 3 + 3 = 6 berries.

Now, let's consider the timer. The longer Ava takes, the lower her score will be. Since Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma, let's assume Emma finishes the level in t seconds. Then, Ava finishes the level in t + 4 seconds.

Emma's score from the timer is 30t, and Ava's score from the timer is 30(t + 4).

Now, we can write the total score for each of them:

Emma's total score = x + 3 + 30t
Ava's total score = x + 8 + 6 + 30(t + 4)

Simplifying Ava's total score, we get:
Ava's total score = x + 8 + 6 + 30t + 120
Ava's total score = x + 134 + 30t

Now, we need to find the difference between their scores:
Difference = Ava's total score - Emma's total score
Difference = (x + 134 + 30t) - (x + 3 + 30t)
Difference = 131 + 30t - 30t - 3
Difference = 128

So, the difference between their two scores is 128."
"To find out how much the other two pizzas cost, we need to first find out how much the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each cost in total. 

Two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, so 2 x 30 = 60 dollars. 

Now, we know that the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars. To find out how much the other two pizzas cost, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost. 

64 - 60 = 4 dollars. 

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we need to divide the remaining cost by 2 to find out how much each of the other two pizzas cost. 

4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on usual days and the extra days to get the total number of times they ride in a week. 15 + 12 = 27.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Bob initially had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 orange and 4 white.
- He bought fish from the pet store and added them to his pond.
- After adding the new fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'x'. Since he bought a total of 17 fish, the number of orange fish he bought is 17 - x.

The total number of orange fish in the pond after buying more fish is 3 (initial orange fish) + (17 - x) (orange fish bought). The total number of white fish in the pond after buying more fish is 4 (initial white fish) + x (white fish bought).

Since Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 + (17 - x) = 2 * (4 + x)

Simplifying the equation:

3 + 17 - x = 8 + 2x

Combine like terms:

20 - x = 8 + 2x

Add x to both sides:

20 = 8 + 3x

Subtract 8 from both sides:

12 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

4 = x

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total miles driven per week and then multiply it by the fuel efficiency and the price of gas.

First, let's find the total miles driven per week. Since Andy drives to work and back home every day from Monday to Friday, the total miles driven per day is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles. 

The total miles driven per week is 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles/week.

Now, let's find out how much gas is consumed per week. Since the fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, we can divide the total miles driven per week by the fuel efficiency to get the total gallons of gas consumed per week: 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, we can multiply the total gallons of gas consumed per week by the price of gas to get the total money spent per week: 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the amount she spent from the quarters and the twenties separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the total amount of money she got from the quarters. Since there are 10 twenties, she got 10 * 20 = 200 dollars from the twenties. However, she only used 3/5 of the twenties, so she used 3/5 * 200 = 120 dollars from the twenties.

Now, let's find the total amount of money she got from the quarters. Since there are 4 quarters in a dollar, 140 quarters is equal to 140 / 4 = 35 dollars.

Now, let's add the amount she spent from the twenties and the quarters. 120 + 35 = 155.

"To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we need to first find out how many TVs were not sold as smart TVs or analog TVs. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, so the number of smart TVs sold is 1/4 * 40 = 10.

One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, so the number of analog TVs sold is 1/8 * 40 = 5.

The total number of TVs sold that are not OLED is 10 (smart TVs) + 5 (analog TVs) = 15.

Since there are 40 TVs in total, the number of OLED TVs sold is 40 - 15 = 25.

"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his earnings for the first 2 months and the next 12 months. 

For the first 2 months, Billy earns $10 per hour. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, there are 8 weeks in 2 months. 8 weeks * 20 hours/week = 160 hours. So, Billy earns 160 * $10 = $1600 in the first 2 months.

For the next 12 months, Billy earns $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour for the first 10 months, and $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour for the next 2 months. 10 months * 20 hours/week * 52 weeks/year = 10,400 hours. 2 months * 20 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 hours. So, Billy earns 10,400 * $10.50 + 160 * $11.50 = $107,600 + $1840 = $109,440 in the next 12 months.

In total, Billy earns $109,440 + $1600 = $110,040.

Sally's starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. So, Sally earns 20 * $10.50 = $210 in the first 2 months. For the next 12 months, Sally earns 20 * $11.00 = $220 per hour for the first 10 months, and 20 * $11.50 = $230 per hour for the next 2 months. So, Sally earns 10,400 * $11.00 + 160 * $230 = $112,400 + $36,800 = $149,200 in the next 12 months.

In total, Sally earns $149,200 + $210 = $149,410.

The difference between Billy's earnings and Sally's earnings is $149,410 - $110,040 = $39,370."

"To find out how many points Nikita scored, we need to first find out half of Pierson's score. Half of 278 is 278 / 2 = 139. 

Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, so Nikita scored 139 + 11 = 150 points.

To find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we need to add their scores together. Pierson scored 278 points and Nikita scored 150 points. 

278 + 150 = 428

The final answer is: 428"
"To find the total number of trees planted by the students, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of students per class and then multiply that by the number of trees each student plants.

Number of classes: 40
Average students per class: 25
Total students: 40 * 25 = 1000
Trees planted by students: 1000 * 1 = 1000

To find the total number of trees planted by the teachers, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of teachers per class and then multiply that by the number of trees each teacher plants.

Number of classes: 40
Average teachers per class: 3
Total teachers: 40 * 3 = 120
Trees planted by teachers: 120 * 2 = 240

Total trees planted: Trees planted by students + Trees planted by teachers
Total trees planted = 1000 + 240
Total trees planted = 1240

The final answer is: 1240"
"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to first find out the total number of stuffed animals she has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of 14. 

30% of 14 = (30/100) * 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 

So, Bubbles should buy 5 stuffed goats. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in 2 weeks and 1 week.

In 2 weeks, there are 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in 2 weeks.

In 1 week, there are 7 days. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in 1 week.

Total hours Kris has played = 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours she has played from the total hours required for the achievement: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between the two distances.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles

The distance between the two cars will be the difference between the distance traveled by the second car and the distance traveled by the first car:
140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

The final answer is: 20"

Cost of diamond: $600
Cost of gold: $300
Total cost of diamond and gold: $600 + $300 = $900

The premium is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold, which is 0.3 x $900 = $270.

Total cost with premium: $900 + $270 = $1170

The final answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to find the total number of students who passed and the total number of students. 

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:
- Third graders: 340
- Fourth graders: 40
- Fifth graders: Since the pass rate for fifth graders is twice the pass rate of fourth graders, and the pass rate of fourth graders is 40/100, the pass rate of fifth graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. So, the number of fifth graders who passed is 80.

Now, let's find the total number of students who passed:
340 (third graders) + 40 (fourth graders) + 80 (fifth graders) = 460

Next, let's find the total number of students:
500 (third graders) + 100 (fourth graders) + 400 (fifth graders) = 1000

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
(460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%

The final answer is: 46"
"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to first find out how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has.

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and he has 2 bags of glass chips, we need to find out how many glass chips he has in total. 

Each bag has 72 glass chips, so 2 bags will have 2 x 72 = 144 glass chips.

Now, we need to divide the total number of glass chips by the number of chips needed to make one square inch of the mosaic. 

144 glass chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, and we know the area of the mosaic (12 square inches), we can find the length of the mosaic by dividing the area by the height.

Length = Area / Height
Length = 12 square inches / 3 inches
Length = 4 inches

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of tea left, we need to calculate the total amount of tea drank by the students. 

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 4 x 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 16 x 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea drank by all the students is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party in gallons is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"Dale started with 100 candies. He sold 150, so he had 100 - 150 = -50 candies left. 

Since you can't have a negative number of candies, this means he actually sold more than he had. So, we need to add the 100 new candies he ordered to the initial 100. 

Now, he has 100 + 100 = 200 candies. He needs to sell 200 - 150 = 50 more candies to sell all of his candy.

"To find the number of students at the end of May, we need to calculate the number of times the students double in a year. 

Since the students double every month, they will double 12 times in a year (January to December). 

The initial number of students is 10. 

Doubling 10 for the first time: 10 * 2 = 20
Doubling 20 for the second time: 20 * 2 = 40
Doubling 40 for the third time: 40 * 2 = 80
Doubling 80 for the fourth time: 80 * 2 = 160
Doubling 160 for the fifth time: 160 * 2 = 320
Doubling 320 for the sixth time: 320 * 2 = 640
Doubling 640 for the seventh time: 640 * 2 = 1280
Doubling 1280 for the eighth time: 1280 * 2 = 2560
Doubling 2560 for the ninth time: 2560 * 2 = 5120
Doubling 5120 for the tenth time: 5120 * 2 = 10240
Doubling 10240 for the eleventh time: 10240 * 2 = 20480
Doubling 20480 for the twelfth time: 20480 * 2 = 40960

Now, we need to find the number of additional students by subtracting the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May. 

40960 - 10 = 40950

The final answer is: 40950"
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find out how many branches he climbed in total. We know he made $105 and he charges $.25 per branch. 

To find the total number of branches, we can divide the total money made by the cost per branch: 

$105 / $.25 = 420 branches

Since Felix works 5 days a week, we can find the average number of branches he climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by 5:

420 branches / 5 days = 84 branches per day

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each group of flowers and then subtract the petals that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each group:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 x 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 x 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each group, we need to subtract 4 petals from the total: 101 - 4 = 97

The final answer is: 97"
"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the marshmallows used and the ones dropped from the total. 

Total marshmallows = 35
Marshmallows used by John = 9
Marshmallows used by DeSean = 9
Total marshmallows used = 9 + 9 = 18
Marshmallows dropped = 3
Total marshmallows lost = 18 + 3 = 21
Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14

Now, we need to find out how many S'mores each kid can make with the remaining marshmallows. 

Total marshmallows left = 14
Each S'more uses 1 marshmallow
Total S'mores = 14

Since there are two kids, we need to divide the total S'mores by 2 to find out how many each kid can have.

Total S'mores / 2 = 14 / 2 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how much money is used, we need to calculate how many quarters each person plays for and then multiply that by the cost per quarter.

Jack can play for 20 minutes. Two of his friends can play for half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes. The other friend can play for 1.5 times as long, so they can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes.

Since they play for 4 hours, we need to convert this to minutes. 4 hours is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate how many times each person can play in 240 minutes:

- Jack: 240 / 20 = 12 times
- The two friends who play for 10 minutes: 240 / 10 = 24 times each
- The friend who plays for 30 minutes: 240 / 30 = 8 times

Now, let's calculate the total number of quarters used:
- Jack: 12 * 1 = 12 quarters
- The two friends: 24 * 2 = 48 quarters
- The better friend: 8 * 1 = 8 quarters

Total quarters used: 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total amount of money used is:
68 * 0.25 = $17

The final answer is: $17"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces.
- The amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance.
- The amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar.
- The amount of oil is twice as much as the amount of salt.
- The amount of salt is twice as much as the amount of citrus zest.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as Z. Since the amount of salt is twice as much as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of salt is 2Z. Since the amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, the amount of sugar is also 2Z. 

The amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, so the amount of fragrance is Z. 

The amount of oil is twice as much as the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is 2 * 2Z = 4Z.

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, which is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients. So, we can write the equation:

Z + Z + 2Z + 2Z + 4Z = 10

Combine like terms:

8Z = 10

Divide both sides by 8:

Z = 10 / 8
Z = 1.25

Since the amount of oil is 4Z, we can find the amount of oil by multiplying 4 by 1.25:

4 * 1.25 = 5

The final answer is: 5"

Now, let's subtract the number of cupcakes Paul already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs:
63 - 48 = 15

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

4. In total, Joe sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars. So, he gave away a total of 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

5. To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the total number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first find out how much money the students raised in total. We know that the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations. 

So, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Since there are 20 students and they each earn the same amount, we can divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 / 20 = $6,250.

The final answer is: $6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 
On the second day, she walked half as many hours as the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in hours, we add the time from both days: 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the total hours by 60 to find the total minutes: 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during lunch break, we need to first find the total number of cars in the parking lot when he got out of class for lunch. 

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When he got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had gone. This means 1/2 of 70 had left, so 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars had left. 

Now, to find the number of cars remaining, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars: 70 - 35 = 35.

So, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot when Hunter got out of class for lunch is 35.

The total number of cars he counted during lunch break is 35."
"To find out how much John makes in a day, we need to multiply the number of cycles he does in a day by the number of tasks in each cycle and the pay for each task. 

Number of cycles per day: 30
Number of tasks per cycle: 5
Pay per task: $1.20

Daily earnings = Number of cycles * Number of tasks per cycle * Pay per task
Daily earnings = 30 * 5 * $1.20
Daily earnings = 30 * $6
Daily earnings = $180

Since John works a full 7-day week, we need to multiply his daily earnings by 7.

Weekly earnings = Daily earnings * 7
Weekly earnings = $180 * 7
Weekly earnings = $1260

"To find out how many points Sasha scored in the first game, we already know that she scored 14 points. 

In the first game, Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so we need to subtract 4 from Sasha's score. 
Julie's score in the first game = 14 - 4 = 10 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. 
Sasha's score in the second game = 10 - 6 = 4 points.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we need to add her scores from both games.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Total cards = 341
2. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick.
3. Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has.

Let's use a variable to represent the number of cards PJ has. Let's call it x.

Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards.

We know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is the sum of the cards that Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write an equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Smendrick has:

Smendrick has 3x = 3(47) = 141 cards

And Becca has 12 more than Smendrick:

Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards

Cindy had 5 green eggs.

She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the cost of the book.

The cost of shipping is calculated by multiplying the weight of the book by the cost per pound and adding the cost per mile multiplied by the distance. 

Cost of shipping = (weight * cost per pound) + (distance * cost per mile)
Cost of shipping = (4 * $0.35) + (20 * $0.08)
Cost of shipping = $1.40 + $1.60
Cost of shipping = $3.00

The refund amount is 75% of the book's purchase price.
Refund amount = 0.75 * $32
Refund amount = $24

Now, we subtract the refund amount from the cost of shipping to find out how much Milly will lose.
Loss = Cost of shipping - Refund amount
Loss = $3.00 - $24
Loss = -$21

However, since we can't lose a negative amount of money, we need to recalculate the loss by considering the cost of shipping as a positive value and the refund as a negative value.
Loss = Cost of shipping - Refund amount
Loss = $3.00 - $24
Loss = -$21

To make it positive, we can change the sign of the loss.
Loss = -$21
Loss = $21

So, Milly will lose $21."
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to first calculate the total amount of money she has after her father gave her $100. 

Mulan initially had $40. Her father gave her $100. So, she now has $40 + $100 = $140.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought. She bought two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of jeans is 2 x $30 = $60. She also bought a bag for $20. The total cost of the items is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, we need to subtract the total cost of the items from the total amount of money she has. $140 - $80 = $60.

So, Mulan has $60 left.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first find out how much he produced in the second and third weeks.

In the first week, Boris produced 8,000 bars of chocolate. 
In the second week, Boris produced half as much as the first week, so he produced 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars of chocolate.
In the third week, Boris produced three times as much as the first week, so he produced 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars of chocolate.

Now, let's add up the total amount of chocolate produced in the first three weeks: 
8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars of chocolate.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month, we can find out how much he produced in the fourth week by subtracting the total amount produced in the first three weeks from the total amount produced in a month:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the total time she spends on TikTok in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on TikTok in a week:

- She records 18 videos, each taking 4 minutes. So, the total time spent recording videos is 18 * 4 = 72 minutes.
- She spends 2 hours writing songs, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.
- She spends 15 minutes each day for 6 days doing her makeup, so the total time spent on makeup is 15 * 6 = 90 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time spent on TikTok in a week:
72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 282 minutes to hours:
282 / 60 = 4.7 hours

Now, let's multiply the time spent on TikTok in a week by 4 to find the time spent in a month:
4.7 * 4 = 18.8 hours

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of the initial installation is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, we need to calculate the cost of the additional items.

Additional mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors, cost is 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
Additional chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier, cost is 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
Additional pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 pictures, cost is 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

Total cost of additional items: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

Total cost = initial installation + cost of additional items = $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to find out how high Saskay can lift a mountain, then multiply it by 12, then multiply that by 4, and finally multiply that by 10.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we need to convert 480 inches to feet. 480 / 12 = 40 feet.

Distance = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles

For the next 6 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance in the first 4 hours + Distance in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total distance = 80 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. 

Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can find the time for one kangaroo by dividing 18 hours by 3. 

18 hours / 3 kangaroos = 6 hours per kangaroo

Now, we know that the turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, if one kangaroo takes 6 hours, one turtle will take twice as long, which is 12 hours.

Since there are four turtles, we need to multiply the time it takes for one turtle by 4.

12 hours * 4 = 48 hours

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's help. 

First, let's calculate the price of the new laptop after trading in her old one: 
Original price of the laptop: $600
Discount for trading in her old laptop: $200
Price after trading in: $600 - $200 = $400

Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom gave her $80. 
Total money from job and mom: $150 + $80 = $230

Now, let's add the money Erika already had in her purse (which we don't know yet) to the money she received from her job and her mom. We know that after this, she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop. 
So, the total money she has is $50 less than the price of the laptop after trading in: 
Total money = $400 - $50 = $350

Now, let's subtract the money she received from her job and her mom from the total money she has: 
Money in purse = Total money - Money from job and mom
Money in purse = $350 - $230
Money in purse = $120

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many slices Adam has left, we need to first calculate the total number of slices he made. 

3 large apples can be sliced into 3 x 5 = 15 slices. 
5 small apples can be sliced into 5 x 3 = 15 slices. 

So, in total, Adam made 15 + 15 = 30 slices. 

Adam ate 15 slices, so to find out how many are left, we subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices made: 
30 - 15 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we need to first find out how many cows he needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day with the current milk production.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we can divide 25 by 5 to find out how many cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

25 / 5 = 5

So, the farmer needs 5 cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. 

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to subtract 3 from 5 to find out how many more cows he needs.

5 - 3 = 2

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each used part and subtract it from the original length of the glue stick.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the used part is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6. The length of the used part is 5/6 * 12 = 10 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the used part is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. The length of the used part is 1/3 * 12 = 4 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the used part is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. The length of the used part is 1/2 * 12 = 6 millimeters.

Now, let's find the total length of the used parts: 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is the original length minus the total length of the used parts: 12 - 20 = -8 millimeters.

However, since we can't have a negative length, it seems there's an error in the problem. The problem statement is likely incorrect, and the glue sticks cannot have a negative length."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy and subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the items is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10080.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so he has a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

Now, let's subtract the amount of money Gabriel has from the total cost of the items: $10080 - $5200 = $3580.

So, Gabriel still needs $3580."
"To find out how much change Thea got, we need to subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount she gave the craftsman. 

First, let's find the total amount she gave the craftsman. Since she gave four $20 bills, we multiply 4 by 20. 
4 x 20 = 80

Now, we subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount she gave the craftsman. 
80 - 70 = 10

So, Thea got $10 as change."
"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract that from the initial amount he had.

Craig has 2 twenty dollar bills, so he has 2 x $20 = $40.

He buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so he spent 6 x $2 = $12.

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so he spent 3 x $3 = $9.

The total amount he spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount he had: $40 - $21 = $19.

So, Craig has $19 left."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, but we don't know how many socks Jack has yet.
3. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.
4. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
5. Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, Peter has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total socks = Peter's socks + Jack's socks = 60 + 30 = 90
Total dishes = Peter's dishes + Jack's dishes = 30 + 60 = 90

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90 + 90 = 180."

"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to find the total time available for performances and then divide it by the time each group takes.

The total time available for performances is the total time of the concert minus the intermission time. 
Total time of the concert = 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
Intermission time = 10 minutes
Time available for performances = 120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Each group takes 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes to perform and exit.

Now, we divide the time available for performances by the time each group takes:
110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

"To find the number of white shirts with no collars, we need to find the total number of white shirts and divide it by 2 since half of them have collars. 

Total white shirts = 40
White shirts with collars = 40 / 2 = 20
White shirts with no collars = 40 - 20 = 20

To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we need to find the total number of floral shirts and subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons.

Total floral shirts = 50
Floral shirts with buttons = 20
Floral shirts with no buttons = 50 - 20 = 30

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.

"To find out how many goats are left in the two farms altogether, we need to first find out how many goats were sold from each farm. 

From Farm X, 10 goats were sold. 
From Farm Y, twice as many goats were sold as from Farm X, so 2 * 10 = 20 goats were sold from Farm Y.

Now, let's find out how many goats are left in each farm. 
In Farm X, 55 - 10 = 45 goats are left. 
In Farm Y, 45 - 20 = 25 goats are left.

Now, let's add the number of goats left in both farms to find the total number of goats left.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. I am three years younger than my brother.
2. I am 2 years older than my sister.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age.
4. When you add all our ages, you get 87.

Let's use variables to represent each person's age:
- Let B be my brother's age.
- Let S be my sister's age.
- Let M be my mom's age.
- Let A be my age.

From point 1, we know A = B - 3.
From point 2, we know A = S + 2.
From point 3, we know M = 3B - 1.
From point 4, we know A + B + S + M = 87.

We can substitute the expressions for A and M from points 1 and 3 into the equation from point 4:
(B - 3) + B + (B - 3 - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87
Combine like terms:
5B - 8 = 87
Add 8 to both sides:
5B = 95
Divide by 5:
B = 19

Now that we know B, we can find A:
A = B - 3
A = 19 - 3
A = 16

So, I am 16 years old."

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each person would be:

- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:

3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's use variables to represent the number of books each person has:

- Let's say Anne has x books.
- Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has x + 25 books.
- Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Fawn has x + 12 books.

The total number of books they have together is 85, so we can write an equation:

180 * 50 = 9000

Now, we know that Isaias made a profit of $2000. To find out how much he spent on buying the chickens, we need to subtract the profit from the total amount he made.

Total amount made = 9000
Profit = 2000
Cost price = Total amount made - Profit
= 9000 - 2000
= 7000

So, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 2 since they sold an equal number. 

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people who sold an equal number of glasses = 2 (Micah and Mitchell)
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / 2
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = 32 / 2
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = 16

Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah. 
Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 16
Difference in glasses sold by Julie and Micah = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah
Difference in glasses sold by Julie and Micah = 14 - 16
Difference in glasses sold by Julie and Micah = -2

The final answer is: -2"
"To find out how much Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure first.

Let's start with the cost of the manicure. Since Iris spent 1/4 as much on the manicure as she did on her hair, and she spent $400 on her hair, the cost of the manicure is 1/4 * 400 = $100.

Now, let's find the cost of the pedicure. The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 as much as the manicure. Since the manicure cost $100, the pedicure cost is 3/4 * 100 = $75.

Now, we add up the costs of the hair, manicure, and pedicure to find the total amount spent at the spa. The total cost is $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The final answer is: $575"
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to first calculate how much money she will get from selling the rope. 

She has a 20-meter long rope and sells it for $2 a meter. So, the total amount of money she will get is 20 * 2 = $40.

Now, she wants to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 a meter. Let's say the new rope is also 20 meters long. The total cost of the new rope will be 20 * 1.5 = $30.

To find out how much money she will have left over, we need to subtract the cost of the new rope from the money she got from selling the old rope. 

So, the money left over will be 40 - 30 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years. This means that her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years old.

We need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's call this number x. So, her age after x years will be 8 + x.

We know that her age after x years will be thrice her present age, so we can set up the equation: 8 + x = 3 * 8.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 8 + x = 24.

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get: x = 16.

So, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age in 16 years.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken. Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and since 5 packs of bacon cost $10, each pack of bacon costs $10 / 5 = $2. So, each pack of chicken costs $2 x 2 = $4. Since Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 x $4 = $24.

Next, let's find the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is 3 x $4 = $12.

Now, let's find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Since Kelly has 7 packs of apples, the total cost of the apples is 7 x $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Finally, let's subtract the total cost of the items from Kelly's budget: $65 (budget) - $60 (total cost) = $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"Let's break down the information given. 

The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, and it has a 15-minute encore. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. 

Let's denote the runtime of her usual concerts as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, its runtime is 2x. 

The total runtime of the final concert is the sum of the runtime of the concert and the encore, which is 2x + 15. We are given that this total runtime is 65 minutes. 

So, we can set up the equation: 2x + 15 = 65.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15. 

2x = 50

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x: x = 50 / 2.

x = 25

"To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged, we first need to find out how many microphones won't fit. 

20% of 50 microphones won't fit, so we need to find 20% of 50. 

20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 microphones won't fit.

Since the singer wants to arrange the microphones in pairs, we need to find the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs. 

Let's say the number of pairs is x. Since each pair has 2 microphones, the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 2x.

We know that the total number of microphones is 50, and 10 won't fit. So, the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 50 - 10 = 40.

Since each pair has 2 microphones, we can set up the equation: 2x = 40.

To find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2.

x = 40 / 2
x = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, Jerry counts 6 birds in the bushes.

Then, 2/3 of 6 is 4, so 2/3rd of the birds flying overhead is 4 birds. 

Next, Jerry sees 3 groups of 8 birds each, so the total number of birds feeding is 3 x 8 = 24.

Now, let's add the number of birds in each group together: 6 (in the bushes) + 4 (flying overhead) + 24 (feeding) = 34.

The final answer is: 34"

"To find the number of flowering plants, we need to first find the number of indoor and outdoor plants.

One-fourth of the plants are indoor plants. 
Number of indoor plants = 100 * (1/4) = 25

Remaining plants = 100 - 25 = 75

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants.
Number of outdoor plants = 75 * (2/3) = 50

Number of flowering plants = 75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we need to divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.
Percentage of flowering plants = (25/100) * 100 = 25%

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to know the speed of the thingamabob first. Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, and a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can find the speed of the thingamabob by dividing 121 by 11.

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig by multiplying the speed of the thingamabob by 5.

Speed of whirligig = 11 * 5 = 55 meters per second

"Let's break down the information given. Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad. 

Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Ellen pays a total of $11 for her daily goods, and the total cost of the salad and the yogurt is $9. So, the cost of two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

Since Ellen eats two carrots every day, the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. To find out the total number of hours he works in a week, we multiply the number of hours he works per day by the number of days he works per week: 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Tasha made $80 in total from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We know she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn. 

Let's say the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn is 'x'. Then, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is 3x, and the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is 5x.

The total amount of money Tasha made from mowing lawns is $6x + 3x + 5x = 14x.

We know that the total amount of money Tasha made from mowing lawns and selling lemonade is $80. Since she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, we can set up the equation:

6x + 14x + lemonade sales = 80

Combine like terms:
20x + lemonade sales = 80

We know that Tasha made $80 in total, and $6 from mowing Joe's lawn. So, the amount of money she made from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns is $80 - $6 = $74.

Since the amount of money she made from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns is $74, and the ratio of the amount of money she made from mowing Kamala's lawn to the amount of money she made from mowing Joe's lawn is 3:1, and the ratio of the amount of money she made from mowing Alba's lawn to the amount of money she made from mowing Joe's lawn is 5:1, we can set up the equation:

3x + 5x = 74

Combine like terms:
8x = 74

Divide both sides by 8:
x = 9.25

Now that we know x, we can find the amount of money Tasha made from mowing Kamala's lawn, which is 3x = 3 * 9.25 = 27.75. The amount of money she made from mowing Alba's lawn is 5x = 5 * 9.25 = 46.25.

The total amount of money Tasha made from mowing lawns is $6 + $27.75 + $46.25 = $80. We know that the total amount of money Tasha made from mowing lawns and selling lemonade is $80. So, the amount of money she made from lemonade sales is $80 - $80 = $0.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Martha initially had some notebooks, but we don't know the exact number. Let's call the number of notebooks Martha initially had ""x"". 

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3x notebooks.

Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so now she has x + 5 notebooks.

We are also told that after buying 5 more notebooks, Martha had a total of 7 notebooks. So, we can set up the equation x + 5 = 7 to find out how many notebooks Martha initially had.

Solving the equation x + 5 = 7, we get x = 2. This means Martha initially had 2 notebooks.

Now that we know Martha initially had 2 notebooks, we can find out how many notebooks Joseph had. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has: 7 - 6 = 1.

The total number of bowls eaten is 4 + 2 = 6. 

Since the pot can fill 4 adult or 8 child bowls, we can assume that the pot can fill 8 child bowls. 

So, the total number of bowls the pot can fill is 8. 

To find out how many bowls are left, we subtract the number of bowls eaten from the total number of bowls the pot can fill: 8 - 6 = 2.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Adam's age four years ago was x. 

Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write an equation:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2x

We know that Duncan's age eight years ago was (Duncan's current age - 8) = 60 - 8 = 52.

So, we can set up the equation:
52 = 2x

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2:
x = 52 / 2
x = 26

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. 

Now, we need to find Adam's current age. Since Adam's age four years ago was 26, his current age is 26 + 4 = 30.

Finally, we need to find Adam's age in 8 years.

To find the total number of students, we add these numbers together: 6 + 12 + 38 = 56.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total amount of money the class raised, we need to find the total number of lollipops sold and the total cost of the lollipops. 

First, let's find the total number of lollipops sold. Since each student sold 10 lollipops and there are 30 students, the total number of lollipops sold is 10 * 30 = 300.

Next, let's find the total cost of the lollipops. Since the class bought the lollipops for $0.5 each and they bought 300 lollipops, the total cost is 0.5 * 300 = $150.

Now, let's find the total amount of money the class raised. Since each lollipop was sold for $0.8 and they sold 300 lollipops, the total amount of money raised is 0.8 * 300 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total amount of money raised and the total cost of the lollipops. So, the profit is 240 - 150 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to find the number of each type of pet and add them up.

Larry has 3 cats.

He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add up the number of each type of pet: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47

The final answer is: 47"
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate how many slices Abby and Josh can eat together in a day. 

Abby can eat 2 slices a day. 
Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, so Josh can eat 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.

Together, they can eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days it will last, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat in a day.

24 slices / 6 slices per day = 4 days.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. 

Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old, and by her 10th birthday, she would have been collecting for 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 5 years by 12 months to get the total number of months.

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell every month, we multiply the total number of months by 1 shell/month.

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday."
"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we first need to find out how many cups of tea are in each row. 

Lana has 27 cups of tea in total. She divides these into 3 rows. 

To find out how many cups are in each row, we divide 27 by 3. 

27 / 3 = 9 cups in each row.

Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row will be half of the total cups in each row.

9 / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea in each row.

However, since you can't have half a cup of tea, this means that Lana must have made 4 full cups of mint tea in each row and then used the remaining 0.5 cups to make the chamomile tea. But since the question asks for the number of mint tea cups in each row, we can ignore the 0.5 cups.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to first find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes the sloth 4 hours to make a round trip, in 8 hours he can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips.

Since he picks the same number of berries on each trip, and he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we can divide 24 by 2 to find the number of berries he picks per trip. 

24 / 2 = 12

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12."
"To find out how much water is in the tank, we need to find out how much water they filled the tank with. They filled the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, which is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Now, we need to find out how much water is used in 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so in 6 days, it will be emptied by 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

To find out how much water is remaining in the tank, we need to subtract the water used from the initial amount of water in the tank. So, 5000 - 3000 = 1000 gallons.

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find out how many movies Colby can see, we need to first calculate how much money he has left. 

Colby's parents give him $150 per month. He already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Money left: $150 - $130 = $20

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 and he has $20 left, he can see 2 more movies on Fridays or Saturdays.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to find the calories of each mini pastry and multiply it by the number of each type of pastry. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 
A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we multiply the calories of each mini pastry by the number of each type of pastry: 
200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Now, we add the calories of both types of pastries to get the total calories: 
40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The final answer is: 85000"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to find the total number of Junebugs she removed and divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
= 378 / 5
= 75.6

The final answer is: 75.6"
"To find out how far each vehicle traveled, we need to multiply their speed by the time they traveled.

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so it traveled 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so it traveled 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled. 

300 - 240 = 60

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of toys she has now.

The total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls is the sum of blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings. 

Total number of toys before buying bouncy balls = 31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, we subtract this from the total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls to find the number of bouncy balls.

Number of bouncy balls = Total number of toys after buying bouncy balls - Total number of toys before buying bouncy balls
= 62 - 48
= 14

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old.
2. Paul is 10 years older than John.
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age.

Let's denote John's age as x. Since Paul is 10 years older than John, Paul's age is x + 10.

From point 3, we know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so Peter's age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10.

Now, we know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. We can write an equation based on this information:

Peter's age + Paul's age + Jean's age = 100
(2x + 10) + (x + 10) + Jean's age = 100

Since we don't know Jean's age, let's denote it as y. Now the equation becomes:

(2x + 10) + (x + 10) + y = 100

Combine like terms:

3x + 20 + y = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:

3x + y = 80

We still don't know Jean's age, but we can express Peter's age in terms of x. We know that Peter's age is 2x + 10.

Now, let's go back to point 2, which states that Paul is 10 years older than John. This means that Paul's age is x + 10, and Jean's age is also x + 10 (since Jean's age is not given, we can assume it's the same as Paul's age for now).

Now we have two equations:

1. 3x + y = 80
2. Peter's age = 2x + 10

We can substitute y = 80 - 3x into the second equation:

Peter's age = 2x + 10
2x + 10 = 2x + 10

This equation is true for any value of x, but we still need to find the value of x. Let's go back to the first equation:

3x + y = 80
Since y = x + 10 (Jean's age), we can substitute y:

3x + (x + 10) = 80

Combine like terms:

4x + 10 = 80

Subtract 10 from both sides:

4x = 70

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 17.5

Now that we have the value of x, we can find Peter's age:

Peter's age = 2x + 10
= 2(17.5) + 10
= 35 + 10
= 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria had 1 balloon, and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each. So, the total initial number of balloons is:
1 (Maria's balloon) + 4 x 2 (friends' balloons) = 1 + 8 = 9

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 x 3 = 15

Now, we add the initial number of balloons and the additional balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many tables they need, we first need to find out how many boxes of stuff they have in total. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so they have 10 x 5 = 50 boxes from donations. 
They already have 10 boxes, so in total, they have 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

They can fit 2 boxes per table, so they need 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

They already own 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 more tables.

"To find the average total distance spat, we need to find the total distance spat by each person and then divide it by the number of seeds they spat.

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 x 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 x 12 = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both of them is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

They spat a total of 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

The average total distance spat is 820 / 75 = 10.93 (rounded to two decimal places).

"To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can make in a month and then multiply that by the price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can make in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money each machine can make in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Now, let's find the difference in the amount of money each machine can make:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

So, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay with the 24-hour option and the cost of his stay with the 12-hour option plus the additional hours.

Cameron stays for 17 hours (from 5 pm to 10 am the next day). 

The 24-hour option costs 1600 pesos. 

The 12-hour option costs 1000 pesos. For the additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5), Cameron will pay 5 * 70 = 350 pesos. 

So, the total cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour option: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The answer is 250."
"To find out how much hay each sheep needs, we need to calculate twice the amount each goat needs and then subtract 3 pounds from it. 

Twice the amount each goat needs is 2 * 5 = 10 pounds. 
3 pounds less than that is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we need to find out the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately. 

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds.

For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds.

Now, we add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

"To find out how much money John has left after buying gas and depositing money in the bank, we need to subtract the gas money from his total earnings and then subtract the money he deposited in the bank.

John's total earnings = 50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

After buying gas: 300 dollars - 50 dollars = 250 dollars

After depositing money in the bank: 250 dollars - 100 dollars = 150 dollars

Now, let's calculate how much money John has left after buying 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each.

Cost of pencils = 5 * 10 dollars = 50 dollars

Money left after buying pencils = 150 dollars - 50 dollars = 100 dollars

"To find the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word. 

Craig spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, so the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled is 20 * 15 = 300.

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled is 300 + 50 = 350.

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled and the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled.

Total number of letters = 300 + 350 = 650.

"To find out how much James paid for the CDs, we need to calculate the original price and then subtract the discount. 

First, we find the original price of the CDs: 10 CDs * $15 = $150.

Then, we calculate the discount: 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each: 5 CDs * $40 = $200.

However, he only paid $90 for the CDs, so he made a profit of $200 - $90 = $110.

"To find the time it took James to swim 60% of the distance, we need to first find 60% of 20 miles. 

60% of 20 miles is 0.6 x 20 = 12 miles.

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time it took him to swim 12 miles is 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, we need to find the remaining distance, which is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.

Since James swims at half the speed after resting, his new speed is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

The time it took him to swim the remaining 8 miles is 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

The total time it took James to get across the lake is 6 hours (swimming) + 3 hours (resting) + 8 hours (swimming) = 17 hours.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let's say Azibo scored x points. 
Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, Bahati scored x + 20 points. 
Dinar scored 10 less points than Bahati, so Dinar scored (x + 20) - 10 = x + 10 points.

The total points scored by the three is 45. So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3x + 30 = 45.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 3x = 15.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 5.

"To find out how many reports Vince stapled, we need to find out how many minutes he stapled reports from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM. 

First, we need to find out how many hours he stapled reports. 11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 15 hours by 60 minutes to get the total minutes. 15 * 60 = 900 minutes.

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15. 900 / 15 = 60.

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we multiply 60 sets of 15 minutes by 30 reports. 60 * 30 = 1800.

"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to find the total time she slept and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. This is a total of 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she usually sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, that day she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual. So, she woke up at 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

The time she went to sleep is still 10 p.m. We need to convert this to a 24-hour clock. 10 p.m. is the same as 22:00.

Now, we need to find the time she went to sleep that day. We know she was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m. Since she usually goes to sleep at 22:00, we need to find the time she went to sleep that day. 

To do this, we need to find the time difference between 22:00 and 2:15. 2:15 - 22:00 = 4 hours and 15 minutes. We need to convert this to minutes. 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes. 240 + 15 = 255 minutes. 

However, this is the time she was sleepwalking. We need to subtract this from the total time she usually sleeps. 480 - 255 = 225 minutes. 

But we also need to subtract the time she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual. 480 - 5 = 475 minutes. 

Now, we need to find the time difference between 22:00 and 5:55. 5:55 - 22:00 = 7 hours and 55 minutes. We need to convert this to minutes. 7 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 420 minutes. 420 + 55 = 475 minutes.

"To find the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially, we need to find out how many measuring spoons he has in relation to the measuring cups. 

Jonathan has 2 dozen measuring cups. Since 1 dozen is 12, 2 dozen is 2 x 12 = 24 measuring cups.

It's given that Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. So, the number of measuring spoons he has is 2/3 * 24 = 16 measuring spoons.

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of measuring spoons he has left is 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons. So, the total number of utensils is 24 (measuring cups) + 10 (measuring spoons) = 34.

Occupied beds = 1000 * (1/5) = 200 beds

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to find out how many patients are admitted in 2 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days.
Patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 * 14 = 700 patients

Now, we need to add the initial occupied beds to the patients admitted in 2 weeks to find the total occupied beds.
Total occupied beds = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

To find the unoccupied beds, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity.
Unoccupied beds = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to first find out how many emails are not work-related. 

Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to her family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. So, 6 emails are to her family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after subtracting the family emails from the non-work emails. 9 - 6 = 3.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

1. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.
2. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya.
3. Aliya is 3 years old.

From point 2, we can find Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3. 
Shawna's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years.

From point 1, we can find Shawna's father's age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5. 
Shawna's father's age = 9 * 5 = 45 years.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from the number she reported.

Let's assume the number Courtney reported is 100%. 
20% of 48 is 0.2 x 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48 to find the correct number of people who attended the concert.
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 38.4."
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

- Jason carried 2 balls.
- Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jeffrey carried half of what Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.
- Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

To find the total number of balls, we need to add up the number of balls each boy carried. 
Total number of balls = 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to first find the total number of holes at the end of the third day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes the first day, 13 holes the second day, and 8 holes the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29.

The island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day, which means it had 4 * 10 = 40 holes at the end of the fourth day. 

Since we know the total number of holes at the end of the third day was 29, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 15 more than each of them. 

So, the third person got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, the total number of corn chips they got is 2 x 70 = 140.

The total number of corn chips is the sum of what Amora, Lainey, and the third person got. 

Total corn chips = 140 (Amora and Lainey) + 85 (the third person) = 225

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of travel, we need to first find 50% of the cost of supplies. 

50% of $400 is 0.5 x 400 = $200.

The cost of travel is 50% more than the supplies, so it's the cost of supplies plus 50% of the cost of supplies. 

Cost of travel = cost of supplies + 50% of cost of supplies
Cost of travel = $400 + $200
Cost of travel = $600

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe have caught 339 Pokemon in total.
2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan.
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught.

Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L.

From point 3, we can write an equation: S = 4A - 13.

From point 2, we can write another equation: L = S + 5.

We also know that the total number of Pokemon caught is 339, so we can write the equation: A + S + L = 339.

Now, we can substitute the expression for S from the first equation into the second equation: L = (4A - 13) + 5, which simplifies to L = 4A - 8.

Now we have two equations: A + S + L = 339 and L = 4A - 8.

We can substitute the expression for L into the first equation: A + S + (4A - 8) = 339.

Combine like terms: A + S + 4A - 8 = 339.

Combine A and 4A: 5A + S - 8 = 339.

Now we need to find a way to get S by itself. We can use the equation S = 4A - 13.

Let's substitute S in the equation 5A + S - 8 = 339 with 4A - 13: 5A + (4A - 13) - 8 = 339.

Combine like terms: 5A + 4A - 13 - 8 = 339.

Combine A terms: 9A - 21 = 339.

Add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Divide both sides by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to find half of the number of minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, there are 20 minutes per episode. Half of 20 is 10. 

So, there are 10 episodes in total. 

To find the total minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the minutes per episode. 

10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird traveled in the southerly direction and then add it to the distance the bird traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance the bird traveled in the southerly direction for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Then, the bird traveled in the northerly direction for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Since the bird is traveling south, the distance traveled in the northerly direction is subtracted from the distance traveled in the southerly direction:
Distance traveled in the southerly direction = 300 miles
Distance traveled in the northerly direction = 36 miles
Net distance traveled in the southerly direction = 300 miles - 36 miles
Net distance traveled in the southerly direction = 264 miles

The bird also traveled in the southerly direction for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

Now, we add the net distance traveled in the southerly direction and the additional distance traveled in the southerly direction:
Total distance = 264 miles + 110 miles
Total distance = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"
"To find out how many brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she had and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies. 
She took home 1/2 a dozen brownies from the office, which is 6 brownies. 
Her friends had 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies. 
So, the total number of brownies Greta had initially is 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

To find out how many brownies Greta had left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies: 66 - 18 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 8 * 2 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we need to multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form).

Nani's sister's age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of all three family members: Nani (8 years), his brother (16 years), and his sister (6 years).

The total age of all three family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time it takes for each type of string and then add them together.

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to find the number of players in Zeke's team and add it to the number of players in Carlton's team.

Carlton's team has 13 players. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. 

So, Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33

The final answer is: 33"
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the garden first. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first find out how many oranges she had initially and then subtract the oranges she kept and gave away.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. So, the total number of oranges she bought is 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, which is 2 * 2 = 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

Now, she kept 1/4 of the oranges. 1/4 of 240 is 240 / 4 = 60 oranges.

So, the total number of oranges she gave away and kept is 80 + 60 = 140 oranges.

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the oranges she gave away and kept from the total number of oranges: 240 - 140 = 100 oranges.

"To find out how many hours Tyler has to work, we need to calculate the total cost of the books and subtract the amount he already has. 

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler already has $14, we need to subtract this from the total cost: $39 - $14 = $25.

Now, we need to find out how many hours Tyler has to work to earn $25. Since he earns $5 per hour, we can divide the amount he needs to earn ($25) by his hourly wage ($5): $25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

We know that Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard. This means Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

We also know that the total number of cherries is 60. Since Robert and Richard have 30 and 20 cherries respectively, Jerry must have 60 - (30 + 20) = 10 cherries.

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries. So, Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the information given:

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. 
On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. 
On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. 
So, on Saturday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:

On Saturday:
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes * $6 = $60
- Apple pie: 11 boxes * $15 = $165
Total earnings on Saturday: $60 + $165 = $225

On Sunday:
- Gingerbread: 15 boxes * $6 = $90
- Apple pie: 15 boxes * $15 = $225
Total earnings on Sunday: $90 + $225 = $315

Total earnings for two days: $225 + $315 = $540

"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use. 

She reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day. So, she will use 4 ounces of sunscreen per day. 

Since she will be outside for 8 days, we multiply the amount of sunscreen she uses per day by the number of days: 4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces.

Now, we need to find out how many 8-ounce bottles she will need to cover 32 ounces. To do this, we divide the total amount of sunscreen she needs (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces): 32 ounces / 8 ounces = 4.

So, Pamela will need 4 bottles of sunscreen.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad and twice as old as his brother. 

Let's denote Emil's age when he turns 24 as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B. 

We know that E = 24. 

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so D = 2E. 

D = 2E
D = 2(24)
D = 48

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so B = E/2. 

B = E/2
B = 24/2
B = 12

Now, we need to find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother. Since Emil is 19 now, we need to subtract 5 years from his age when he turns 24 to find his current age. 

Emil's current age = 24 - 5 = 19

His dad's current age = D - 5 = 48 - 5 = 43

His brother's current age = B - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is 43 + 7 = 50.

On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds. 
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, we add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we divide the total amount of crawfish by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find out how many students are leaving early, we first need to find out how many students are football players, and then add the number of cheerleaders or band members.

First, let's find out how many students are football players. 20% of 30 students are football players. 

20% of 30 = 0.2 x 30 = 6 students are football players.

Now, let's find out how many students are not football players. 
30 - 6 = 24 students are not football players.

Out of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. 

25% of 24 = 0.25 x 24 = 6 students are cheerleaders or part of the band.

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to first convert the width of the flower bed from feet to inches. 

1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so 111 feet is equal to 111 x 12 = 1332 inches.

Now, we need to find out how much space each plant will take up, including the space between them. Each plant is 12 inches wide, and there is 1.5 feet (18 inches) between each plant. So, the total space each plant will take up is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we need to divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the space each plant will take up (in inches) to find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed.

1332 / 30 = 44.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so Pat will spend 27 x 6 = $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

4 sunflowers need 4 x 3 = 12 pounds of soil. 
10 carnations need 10 x 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil. 

So, the total soil used for sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds. 

Now, we subtract the used soil from the total soil to find out how much is left for roses. 
30 - 27 = 3 pounds of soil left for roses.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp. 

First, let's find out how many shrimp Emily can peel and cook in one minute. She can peel 6 shrimp a minute and saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. So, in one minute, she can saute 30/10 = 3 shrimp. 

Now, we know she can peel 6 shrimp a minute and saute 3 shrimp a minute. So, in one minute, she can process 6 + 3 = 9 shrimp.

To find out how long it takes her to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to divide 90 by 9. 

90 / 9 = 10

So, it will take Emily 10 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp."
"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the total change in temperature. 

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees an hour. So, the total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees an hour. So, the total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

However, the room warms up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. It was turned off for 2 hours, so the room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. This means that the comet appeared 75 years after Bill's dad was born. 

Let's assume Bill's dad was born x years before the comet appeared. Then, when Bill's dad saw the comet, he was 30 years old, so x + 75 = 30. 

Solving for x, we get x = 30 - 75 = -45. However, this doesn't make sense because you can't be born 45 years before the comet appears. This means that the comet must have appeared before Bill's dad was born. 

Let's assume the comet appeared y years before Bill's dad was born. Then, when Bill's dad saw the comet, he was 30 years old, so y + 30 = 75. 

Solving for y, we get y = 75 - 30 = 45. 

Now, we know that the comet appeared 45 years before Bill's dad was born. 

Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. This means that Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time. 

Since the comet appears every 75 years, the time between the two appearances is 75 years. 

Let's assume Bill was x years old when he saw the comet for the first time. Then, x + 75 = 90. 

Solving for x, we get x = 90 - 75 = 15. 

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To find out how many checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the total number of checks he writes in a year for each type of bill and then add them together.

1. Electric bill: Buford writes 1 check per month, so in a year (12 months), he writes 1 * 12 = 12 checks.
2. Gas bill: Buford writes 1 check per month, so in a year (12 months), he writes 1 * 12 = 12 checks.
3. Church: Buford writes 2 checks per month, so in a year (12 months), he writes 2 * 12 = 24 checks.
4. Pest and lawn service: Buford writes 1 check every 3 months (quarterly), so in a year (4 quarters), he writes 1 * 4 = 4 checks.

Now, let's add the total number of checks Buford writes per year: 
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn service) = 52

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 flights.

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is (3/4) * 88 = 66. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/2) * (88 - 66) = (1/2) * 22 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to find the length of time each wolf howls and add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the length of time each wolf howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Adam's mother gave him $6. 
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

In total, Adam received $6 from his mother and $12 from his father, which is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam bought the trousers for $30. To find out how much he had to contribute from his savings, we need to subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers.

So, Adam had to contribute $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. 
2. The total age of the children is 20, and we know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro, so we can write an equation: 
   Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20
   3 + 4 + Helene's age + W = 20
3. We are also given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 20/4 = 5. 
   So, Helene's age = 2 * average age = 2 * 5 = 10
4. Now we can substitute Helene's age into the equation from step 2:
   3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20
5. Simplify the equation:
   17 + W = 20
6. Solve for W:
   W = 20 - 17
   W = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first find out the total amount of money Walter has collected so far. 

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from a fund he set up online. 

Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Then, Walter's friend gives him $200. 

Total amount collected so far = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. So, we need to find out how much everyone else has donated, which is $2200. 

Walter's lawyer is going to donate 3 times $2200. 

$2200 * 3 = $6600

The final answer is: $6600"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to find out how many cookies were there in total and then divide it by 2. 

There were 100 guests and each guest brought 15 cookies, so the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies.

The bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church, so the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies, so to find out how many people were in the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got. 

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Number of cookies each person got
= 750 / 15
= 50

"Let's say the size of a kid's slice is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of an adult's slice is 2x.

There are 4 kids, so the total size of their slices is 4x. 

There are 2 adults, so the total size of their slices is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total size of all slices is 4x + 4x = 8x.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to divide the total size of their slices by the total size of all slices and multiply by 100.

Percentage of watermelon each adult gets = (4x / 8x) * 100
= 0.5 * 100
= 50%

"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments.

Time spent on rounds: 
- Each inpatient takes 20 minutes, and there are 9 inpatients. 
- Total time spent on rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes
- Convert minutes to hours: 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Time spent on appointments: 
- Each appointment takes 30 minutes, and there are 10 appointments. 
- Total time spent on appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes
- Convert minutes to hours: 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

Total time spent on rounds and appointments = 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours

Since Doctor Jones works 9 hours at the clinic, we subtract the total time spent on rounds and appointments from his total work hours to find the time left for updating records.
- Time left for updating records = 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

First, let's add the time it takes to make the cake batter and bake the cake: 20 minutes + 30 minutes = 50 minutes.

Next, we add the time it takes to cool the cake: 50 minutes + 2 hours = 50 minutes + 120 minutes = 170 minutes.

Now, we convert 2 hours to minutes to make it easier to add: 2 hours = 120 minutes. 

Now we add the time it takes to frost the cake: 170 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours.

Now we add the 3 hours to the time she wants to serve the cake: 5:00 pm + 3 hours = 8:00 pm.

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 8:00 pm - 3 hours = 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm.

The final answer is: 2:00 pm."
"Let's say the number of chocolate bars in a box is x. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We know they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation 8x = 64. 

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8: x = 64 / 8 = 8.

The number of chocolate bars in a box is 8."
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of the students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, so it's rented 3 x 4 = 12 days in a month (assuming a 4-week month).

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25. 
The cost of students per session is $1.50 per student, and there are 10 students, so the total cost of students per session is 10 x $1.50 = $15.

The total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $15 (students) = $40.

Since the studio is rented 12 days in a month, the total number of sessions in a month is 12.

The total earnings per month is the total cost per session multiplied by the number of sessions in a month, which is $40 x 12 = $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars they have by the number of boxes they have.

For Peter: 64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 56 chocolate bars / 7 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha.
Difference = 16 - 8 = 8

"To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5. 

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of babies born in a month is 30 * 4 = 120.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines after a year will be the initial population plus the number of babies born in a year. 

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed, we do that next.

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon.

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

"To find the total number of sticks, we need to find the number of blue and yellow sticks first. 

We know there are 9 red sticks. We also know that there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. So, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

We know the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks. So, the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we have the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks. To find the total number of sticks, we add them together: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

"To find out how much water is remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. 

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons. 

To find the remaining amount of water, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

Let's assume the total capacity of the power bank is 100%. 

After 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour, so it lost 5 * 9 = 45% of its capacity. This means that after 5 hours, the power bank had 100 - 45 = 55% of its capacity left.

After that, the power bank lost 7% of its capacity each hour for 3 hours. So, it lost 3 * 7 = 21% of its capacity. This means that after 3 hours, the power bank had 55 - 21 = 34% of its capacity left.

However, we are told that the charge remaining was 28% after 8 hours. This means that the 34% we calculated is actually the charge after 8 hours, not after 3 hours. So, the power bank lost 34 - 28 = 6% of its capacity in the last 3 hours. 

Since the power bank lost 7% of its capacity each hour for 3 hours, it should have lost 3 * 7 = 21% of its capacity. However, it only lost 6% of its capacity, which means that the power bank was losing 7% of its capacity at a rate that was 15% less than the actual rate. 

Since the power bank was losing 9% of its capacity each hour for 5 hours, it means that the power bank was losing 9% of its capacity at a rate that was 15% less than the actual rate. 

Let's call the actual rate x. Then, 0.85x = 9, where 0.85 is 85% or 100% - 15%. Solving for x, we get x = 9 / 0.85 = 10.59. 

Now, we know that the power bank was losing 10.59% of its capacity each hour for 5 hours. So, it lost 5 * 10.59 = 52.95% of its capacity. This means that after 5 hours, the power bank had 100 - 52.95 = 47.05% of its capacity left.

The answer is 47.05."
"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work, we first need to calculate her total weekly income. 

Her hourly wage is $10 and her hourly tips are $15, so her total hourly income is $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly income is $25 * 40 = $1000.

Now, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of the car, which is 20% of $10000. 

20% of $10000 is 0.2 * $10000 = $2000.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000. We can do this by dividing the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly income ($1000).

$2000 / $1000 = 2.

So, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to first calculate how much money he has left after buying the other fruits. 

3 peaches cost 3 * $.5 = $1.5
4 pears cost 4 * $.5 = $2
2 kiwis cost 2 * $1 = $2
5 apples cost 5 * $.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits so far is $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Since plums cost $.25 each, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum to find out how many plums he can buy: $0.75 / $.25 = 3

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we need to first find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. 

Anne kept 2 packs, so she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Since she gave the packs equally to 10 friends, we need to divide the number of packs by 10. 

13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend.

Since each pack has 60 pieces, we multiply the number of packs each friend received by 60.

1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces.

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."

"To find out how many points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions, and then find out how many of each she is sure to get.

First, let's find out how many easy, average, and difficult questions there are in the quiz. 

There are 60 questions in total. 40% of them are easy, so the number of easy questions is 40% of 60, which is 0.4 x 60 = 24.

The rest of the questions are equally divided as average and difficult, so there are (60 - 24) / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say the number of large stuffed animals sold is L and the number of small stuffed animals sold is S. We know that S = 2L (since she sold twice as many small ones as large ones).

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one, and the price of a small one is $4. So, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total amount earned from the sales is $120. We can set up an equation based on the total amount earned:

(Large stuffed animals) * (price of large stuffed animal) + (small stuffed animals) * (price of small stuffed animal) = Total amount earned
L * $12 + S * $4 = $120

Since S = 2L, we can substitute S with 2L in the equation:
L * $12 + 2L * $4 = $120

Combine like terms:
L * $12 + $8L = $120

Combine the L terms:
(12L + 8L) = $120
20L = $120

Divide both sides by 20:
L = $120 / 20
L = 6

Since S = 2L, we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold:
S = 2 * 6
S = 12

"To find out how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to first find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in a day.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. He can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe, so he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe. 

He can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 pounds is 24 * 0.5 = 12 pounds. So, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, we know that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day, we multiply 36 by 40: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds.

Since there are 30 days in a month, we multiply 1440 by 30 to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The ratio for the first package is 3/2 and the ratio for the second package is 6/4. 

We can simplify the ratios by dividing both numbers in each ratio by their greatest common divisor. 

The simplified ratio for the first package is 3/2 = 1.5 and the simplified ratio for the second package is 6/4 = 1.5. 

Since the ratios are the same, the price of the third package will be proportional to the number of sandwiches. 

The number of sandwiches in the third package is 8, so we multiply the price of the second package by 8/4 to find the price of the third package. 

The price of the second package is $6, so the price of the third package is 6 * (8/4) = 6 * 2 = 12.

"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 x 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so she released 6 yellow balloons, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 x 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's add up the remaining balloons: 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons. 

15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the chance that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). 

However, the third scenario is dependent on the second scenario not happening. So, we need to find the chance that the normal teacher doesn't give an extension, which is 100% - 40% = 60%. 

Now, we multiply the chance of the normal teacher not giving an extension by the chance that Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment: 60% * 20% = 12%.

Now, we add the chance of the substitute teacher not collecting the homework to the chance of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus convincing her: 50% + 12% = 62%.

So, the chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 100% - 62% = 38%.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate can get, we need to first find out how many seats are left after the graduates and faculty have taken their seats. 

Total seats in the Fine Arts Center = 6000
Seats taken by graduates = 950
Seats taken by faculty = 300
Total seats taken = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total seats taken from the total seats in the Fine Arts Center to find the remaining seats.
Remaining seats = 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can get.
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

- It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up.
- He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, so he eats 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.
- Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, so 1 medium-sized bean is equal to 3 small beans.

Now, let's find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat. Since 1 medium-sized bean is equal to 3 small beans, and Grandpa eats 150 medium-sized beans, he eats 150 * 3 = 450 small beans.

The final answer is: 450"
"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first find out how much she makes in total and then subtract her expenses. 

Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so she works a total of 6 * 3 = 18 hours. 

She is paid $15 per day, so for 3 days, she makes 15 * 3 = $45. 

Her daily parking expense is $3, so for 3 days, she pays 3 * 3 = $9.

Now, we subtract her expenses from her total pay: 45 - 9 = $36.

To find out how much she makes per hour, we divide her total pay after expenses by the number of hours she worked: 36 / 18 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how much Ted spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the books and the total cost of the pencils, then add them together.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each is 3 x 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the books and the pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

So, Ted spent a total of 66 dollars."
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to find out how many soda bottles he will place on the driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next.

First, let's find out how many bottles Richard will place on the driveway. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to put a bottle every 3 feet. 

To find the number of bottles, we divide the total width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle: 
24 feet / 3 feet = 8 bottles

Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next, we multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next:
8 bottles * 5 seconds = 40 seconds

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many packs Uncle Franky can make, we need to first find out how many apples he has in total. 

He ordered two boxes of apples, and each box has 40 apples. So, the total number of apples is 2 * 40 = 80 apples.

Now, we need to find out how many packs he can make with 80 apples. Each pack has 8 apples. 

To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack: 80 / 8 = 10.

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract it from the initial amount of money she had.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 x $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 x $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor starts with $50, so to find out how much money she will have left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from the initial amount: $50 - $40 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in college. 

First, let's find out how much money he lost from not working while in school. He had a $25,000 a year job and he was in college for 4 years. 

Money lost from not working = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000

He also got $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years. 

Total loans = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000

Total money lost = Money lost from not working + Total loans
Total money lost = $100,000 + $200,000
Total money lost = $300,000

Now, let's find out how much he earns per year after college. His college degree tripled his income, so he now earns $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.

To find out how long it will take him to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working, we need to divide the total money lost by his new income.

Time to earn the money = Total money lost / New income
Time to earn the money = $300,000 / $75,000
Time to earn the money = 4 years

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to find the dimensions of the fabric pieces. 

The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. The fabric pieces need to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. 

So, the length of the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet and the width will be 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

Now, we need to find the area of one fabric piece. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length and width. 

Area = length * width
Area = 8 * 10
Area = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two fabric pieces, we need to multiply the area by 2.

Total area = 2 * 80
Total area = 160 square feet

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered on each day and add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 
So, they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters on Wednesday.

Now, let's add up the number of letters delivered on each day: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad together: $65 + $36 = $101.

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101."
"To find the average amount Johnny's dad lost, we need to find the total amount he lost and divide it by the number of races.

On the first race, he lost $5.

On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
He previously lost $5, so twice that is 2 * $5 = $10. 
$1 more than that is $10 + $1 = $11. 
So, he won $11 on the second race.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. 
He won $11 in the second race, so 1.5 times that is 1.5 * $11 = $16.50. 
So, he lost $16.50 on the third race.

The total amount he lost is $5 + $16.50 = $21.50.

There were 3 races, so to find the average, we divide the total amount lost by 3: 
$21.50 / 3 = $7.17

The final answer is: $7.17"

"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we need to first find their current heights. 

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is 4 x 12 = 48 inches. Adding the 3 inches he grew, Xavier's current height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches. So, Cole's current height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height. The difference is 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say the amount taken by the first person is x.

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the amount taken by the second person is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the amount taken by the third person is 2(x + 80).

We know that the total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms again:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

So the first person took $420."
"To find the total hours each painter worked, we need to first find the total hours they worked in 3 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 x 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to find 3/8ths of 21 days. 

To do this, we multiply 21 by 3/8. 

First, multiply 21 by 3: 21 x 3 = 63. 

Then, divide by 8: 63 ÷ 8 = 7.875.

So, they worked a total of 7.875 days. 

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply 7.875 by 24 to find the total hours worked: 7.875 x 24 = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to find the hours each painter worked: 189 ÷ 4 = 47.25.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let's say the number of balls retrieved in the second set is x. 

In the first set, Rory retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19.

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction by multiplying the whole equation by 2: 2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38.

Now, let's simplify the equation: 2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38.

Combine like terms: 5x + 8 = 38.

Subtract 8 from both sides: 5x = 30.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 6.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set: x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2010.

The car was bought in 2007 for $20,000. 

The depreciation rate is 21% per year. 

First, we need to find the price of the car in 2008. 
Depreciation in 2008 = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200
Price in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Next, we need to find the price of the car in 2009. 
Depreciation in 2009 = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318
Price in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Finally, we need to find the price of the car in 2010. 
Depreciation in 2010 = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,623.22
Price in 2010 = $12,482 - $2,623.22 = $9,858.78

The price of the car in 2010 is $9,858.78."

Half of the books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

10% of the books are written in German, so that's 10% of 50, which is 0.1 x 50 = 5 books in German.

Now, we add the number of English and German books to find the total number of non-Spanish books: 25 + 5 = 30 books.

Since there are 50 books in total, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20.

"To find the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to find the total number of tiles required and multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, we need to find the area of one tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1ft, the area of one tile is 1ft * 1ft = 1 SqFt.

Now, we need to find the total number of tiles required to cover the kitchen floor. We can do this by dividing the total area of the kitchen floor by the area of one tile.

Total area of kitchen floor = 200 SqFt
Area of one tile = 1 SqFt
Total number of tiles required = Total area of kitchen floor / Area of one tile
Total number of tiles required = 200 / 1
Total number of tiles required = 200

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the total number of tiles required by the cost of each tile.

Cost of each tile = $12
Total number of tiles required = 200
Total cost = Cost of each tile * Total number of tiles required
Total cost = $12 * 200
Total cost = $2400

"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
- 4 twin beds have 2 sheets each, so 4 x 2 = 8 twin sheets
- 1 king size bed has 1 set of sheets, so 1 king sheet

Total sheets per week = 8 twin sheets + 1 king sheet = 9 sheets

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we need to find the least common multiple of 2 and 1, which is 2. 

So, Greg can wash 2 twin sets of sheets (4 sheets) and 1 king set of sheets (1 sheet) in 2 loads. 

Total loads per week = 9 sheets / 4 sheets per 2 loads = 2.25 loads. Since we can't have a fraction of a load, we round up to the nearest whole number. 

Total loads per week = 3 loads

To find the total loads per year, we multiply the total loads per week by the number of weeks in a year. 

There are 52 weeks in a year. 

Total loads per year = 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

So, James doesn't respond to 16 emails. 

To find out how many emails he responds to, we subtract the number of emails he doesn't respond to from the total number of emails. 

80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Since James responds to 64 emails per day, we need to multiply this number by 5 to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week.

"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to first calculate how many pizzas the glee club and the football team ate.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 is 0.7 x 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. 
They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 x 40 = 32 pizzas.

In total, they ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to find the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. So, the cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

He wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, so he wants to send out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. So, the cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

Now, we add the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons together. 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100. 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

The final answer is: $245"
"To find out how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered, we need to subtract 3 from 10. 

10 - 3 = 7

So Sidney ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. 

Then Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. 

7 - 4 = 3

So Sidney had 3 meatball sub sandwiches left. 

Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, we need to multiply the number of remaining sandwiches by the number of meatballs in each sandwich.

3 * 4 = 12

Sidney had 12 meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained."
"To find the number of trucks that had mechanical failures, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

So, 5 trucks had mechanical failures and could not deliver the fertiliser. 

The number of trucks that delivered the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. 

The total number of tons of fertiliser delivered is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find out how much Dennis will pay for 6 pounds of butter, we need to first calculate how much he will pay for 6 pounds with the promotion. 

Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter. 

The promotion is buy one pound of butter get one half off, so for every 2 pounds of butter, he will pay the full price of $4.00. 

To find out how many sets of 2 pounds of butter he needs, we divide 6 pounds by 2. 6 / 2 = 3. 

So, he will need 3 sets of 2 pounds of butter. 

For 3 sets of 2 pounds of butter, he will pay 3 * $4.00 = $12.00 for the full price of the butter. 

However, he will get 3 pounds of butter for free, so he will only pay for 3 pounds of butter. 

The cost of 3 pounds of butter is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the total cost of the party, we need to first find the total number of guests. 

Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 dance class girls, and 13 family members, but 4 people said they could not come. 

Total number of guests = 25 + 7 + 13 - 4 = 41

Since the theater can hold 20 people for free, we need to find the number of additional guests. 

Additional guests = Total number of guests - 20 = 41 - 20 = 21

The fee for the additional guests is $6 each. 

Cost for additional guests = 21 * 6 = 126

The total cost of the party is the fee to rent the theater plus the cost for the additional guests. 

Total cost = 125 + 126 = 251

The final answer is: 251"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she spent 1/4 of $60. To find out how much she spent, we multiply 60 by 1/4. 

60 * 1/4 = 60 / 4 = 15

So Maggie spent $15. To find out how much she has left, we subtract 15 from 60.

60 - 15 = 45

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she spent 1/3 of $60. To find out how much she spent, we multiply 60 by 1/3.

60 * 1/3 = 60 / 3 = 20

So Riza spent $20. To find out how much she has left, we subtract 20 from 60.

60 - 20 = 40

Now, we need to find out how much money they have left in total. We add Maggie's remaining money to Riza's remaining money.

45 + 40 = 85

The final answer is: 85"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total bananas = 315
- First monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
- Second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.
- The third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we need to find out how many bananas the first two monkeys eat in total and subtract that from the total number of bananas.

First monkey eats 10 bananas each day, and there are 7 days in a week, so the first monkey eats 10 * 7 = 70 bananas in a week.
Second monkey eats 14 bananas each day, so the second monkey eats 14 * 7 = 98 bananas in a week.

Total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week = 70 + 98 = 168 bananas.

Now, we subtract the total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats in a week:
315 - 168 = 147 bananas.

Since we want to know how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the total bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7:
147 / 7 = 21 bananas.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to know how many pieces he placed in total. 

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 

Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 pieces. 

So, in total, Teddy placed 250 + 500 = 750 pieces during that hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find out how much Jenny paid for the roses, we need to calculate the cost of 15 roses. 

Since roses cost $2 each, 15 roses will cost 15 x $2 = $30. 

However, the florist also offers a dozen roses for $15. Since 12 roses are in a dozen, we can calculate the cost of 3 more roses (15 - 12 = 3) at $2 each, which is 3 x $2 = $6. 

So, the cost of 15 roses is $30 - $6 = $24. 

Jenny paid with five $5 bills, which is a total of 5 x $5 = $25. 

Since she paid $25 and the roses cost $24, she has $1 left. 

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to find out how many quarters make up $1. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so Jenny will get 1 x 4 = 4 quarters as change. 

Jenny leaves with 4 quarters."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the total amount from each item and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total amount from milkshakes: 
6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = 6 * 5.50 = $33

Next, let's calculate the total amount from burger platters: 
9 burger platters * $11 each = 9 * 11 = $99

Then, let's calculate the total amount from sodas: 
20 sodas * $1.50 each = 20 * 1.50 = $30

Now, let's add the total amounts from each item together: 
$33 + $99 + $30 = $162

The final answer is: $162"
"To find out how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time he needs to wait for the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train will leave the station after 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station. Since the first train leaves the station after 30 minutes, the second train will arrive 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after the first train's arrival.

3. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train will leave the station after 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

4. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station. Since the second train leaves the station after 65 minutes, the third train will arrive 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after the first train's arrival.

5. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so the time interval between the third train's arrival and departure is 0 minutes.

6. The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. Since the third train leaves the station at 125 minutes, the fourth train will arrive at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

7. Paul will board the fourth train at 145 minutes. Since the first train arrives at 10 minutes, Paul will wait for 145 - 10 = 135 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks Melanie needs to save toothpicks, we first need to find out how many toothpicks she has saved so far. 

She saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. 
10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to save to reach 200 toothpicks. 
200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since she saves 10 toothpicks per week, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks at this rate. 
80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and then the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he bought it for is 75% of $2000, which is 0.75 * $2000 = $1500.

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for, which is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800.

To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price he bought it for, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100.

The difference between the original price and the price he bought it for is $2000 - $1500 = $500.

The percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend is ($500 / $2000) * 100 = 25%.

"To find the total number of jellyfish created, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of jellyfish each spring creates per second. 

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in 4 hours. 

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, we multiply the total seconds by the number of springs.

14400 seconds * 5 springs = 72000 jellyfish

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first find twice Binkie's score. Binkie's score is 90, so twice that would be 2 x 90 = 180. 

Frankie's score is 15 better than twice Binkie's score, so we need to add 15 to 180. 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To find the total distance James walked, we need to calculate the distance to the store and back. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back home, he walked 4 miles to the halfway point and 4 miles back home. 

The total distance walked is 4 miles + 4 miles = 8 miles.

Since James walks 4 miles per hour, we can find the time it took him to walk 8 miles by dividing the total distance by his speed.

Time = Total Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and then subtract the cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's find out how many bananas Jenny bought in total. Since she bought 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, she bought 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

If she bought the bananas individually, each banana would cost $0.80. So, the total cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Now, let's find out how much she paid for the bunches. She bought 10 bunches for $3.00 each, so the total cost of the bunches would be 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money she saved, we subtract the cost of the bunches from the cost of buying the bananas individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, we can say that Harry gets x + 60 feet of fence, and Sam gets x feet of fence. 

We know that the total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to find out how many inches it grows per year and then multiply that by 13.

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find out how many inches it grows per year, we divide 8 by 4.

8 / 4 = 2

So, the crocodile grows 2 inches per year. 

Now, we multiply 2 by 13 to find out how many inches it will grow in 13 years.

2 * 13 = 26

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find out how much Marcel earned, we need to find out how many of each type of bike he sold and then multiply the number of each type by its price.

First, let's find out how many Trekking bikes were sold. We know that half of the 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, so the number of Trekking bikes sold is 300 / 2 = 150.

Next, let's find out how many BMX bikes were sold. We know that 15% of the 300 bikes were BMX bikes, so the number of BMX bikes sold is 300 * 0.15 = 45.

Now, let's find out how many MTB bikes were sold. We know that the rest of the bikes were MTB, so the number of MTB bikes sold is 300 - 150 - 45 = 105.

Now, let's find out the total earnings from each type of bike. The price of an MTB is $500, so the earnings from MTB bikes is 105 * 500 = $52,500. The price of a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, so the price of a BMX bike is 500 / 2 = $250. The earnings from BMX bikes is 45 * 250 = $11,250. The price of a Trekking bike is $450, so the earnings from Trekking bikes is 150 * 450 = $67,500.

Now, let's add up the earnings from each type of bike to find the total earnings. The total earnings is $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250.

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to find out how many bales the farmer makes and how many the truck picks up, and then subtract the number of bales the truck picks up from the number the farmer makes.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour. In 6 hours, the farmer will make 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour. In 6 hours, the truck will pick up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

Now, we need to subtract the number of bales the truck picks up from the number the farmer makes. 30 - 18 = 12.

So, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field.

"To find out how many minutes John spends in class each day, we need to multiply the number of periods by the length of each class. 

6 periods * 40 minutes = 240 minutes per day

Since John goes to class for 5 days a week, we multiply the daily minutes by 5.

240 minutes * 5 days = 1200 minutes per week

Now, we need to find out how many minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday. Since he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days, we first need to find out his total weekly minutes. 

There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily minutes by 7.

240 minutes * 7 days = 1680 minutes per week

Now, we can find 1/16 of his weekly minutes.

1/16 * 1680 minutes = 105 minutes

Now, we add the minutes he spends in class to the minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday.

1200 minutes + 105 minutes = 1305 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60.

1305 minutes / 60 = 21.75 hours

"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to find the height of each child in inches. 

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 x 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to find out how many bags of apples they sold. Since they sold 2000 apples and each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide 2000 by 10 to get the number of bags.

2000 ÷ 10 = 200

Now that we know they sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"To find out how much meat was on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate, we need to work backwards. 

First, the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. Before that, the velociraptors ate half of what was left. So, the velociraptors ate half of 270 kilograms, which is 270 / 2 = 135 kilograms. 

Now, the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, and the velociraptors ate half of what was left. So, the T-Rex ate half of the original amount, and the velociraptors ate half of the remaining half. This means the velociraptors ate 1/4 of the original amount, and the Allosaurus ate 1/4 of the remaining 1/2, which is 1/8 of the original amount. 

Let's call the original amount of meat x. The Allosaurus ate 1/8 of x, which is 270 kilograms. To find x, we need to solve the equation: 1/8 * x = 270.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 8: x = 270 * 8.

x = 2160.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then divide it by the area covered by one gallon of paint. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet. 
The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet. 
The total area of all the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since one gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the total number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost of painting the room is 12 x $12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to find the ratio of shaken sodas to the total number of sodas left.

Initially, Ellen had 12 sodas. She shook 3 of them, so 3 are shaken and 9 are unshaken. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, the ratio of shaken sodas to the total number of sodas is 2/8 = 1/4 or 0.25. 

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%."
"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to find the distance each train has traveled and add them together. 

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

To find the total distance between the two trains, we add the distances they have traveled: 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find the total number of days Billy helps, we need to first find the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.2 (which is the decimal form of 20%). 

50 * 0.2 = 10

So, Billy takes 10 days off. To find the number of days he works, we subtract 10 from the total number of days.

50 - 10 = 40

Now, we know Billy works 40 days. Since he can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, we need to find the total number of hours he works in a day. 

3 hours/day * 40 days = 120 hours

Since he can help 2 people per hour, we multiply the total number of hours by 2.

120 hours * 2 people/hour = 240 people

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to find out how many people were in the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people who attended the wedding.

First, let's find out how many people were in the buses. There were 12 buses, and each bus carried 35 people. 

12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people in the buses.

Next, let's find out how many people were in the cars. There were 20 cars, and each car carried 3 people.

20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people in the cars.

Now, let's add the number of people in the buses and the cars to find the total number of people who were not inside the church.

420 people (in buses) + 60 people (in cars) = 480 people.

Since the total number of people who attended the wedding is the sum of the people in the buses, cars, and inside the church, we can assume that the total number of people who attended the wedding is the sum of the people in the buses and cars plus the people inside the church. 

Let's call the number of people inside the church 'x'. Then, the total number of people who attended the wedding is x + 480.

We know that the total number of people who attended the wedding is the sum of the people in the buses and cars, which is 480. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 480 = total number of people who attended the wedding

"To find out how long it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of each slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes
For the second biggest slide: 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the two slides: 
5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total time Bobby takes for lunch and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks. 

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks, which is 30 minutes. 

So, the total time per day is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour.

Bobby works for 5 days, so we multiply the time per day by 5.

1 hour * 5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we need to first find out how many miles Micah ran. We know that Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. Since Amber ran 8 miles, we multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

8 * 3.5 = 28

So, Micah ran 28 miles. Now, we know that Amber and Micah together ran 8 + 28 = 36 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the miles Amber and Micah ran from the total miles.

52 - 36 = 16

So, Ahito ran 16 miles. 

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought after returning the item and then add it to the initial charge minus the returned item.

Initial charge: $85.00
Returned item: -$15.00
New balance after return: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage:
$20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00
Discounted price of the frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage:
$30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00
Discounted price of the towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Total cost of the new purchases: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

New balance on the credit card: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

The final answer is: $113.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

- A fifth of the jellyfish are large.
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
- The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue.
- When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.

Since a third of the large jellyfish change color, and 6 jellyfish changed color, we can set up an equation to find the number of large jellyfish. Let's call the total number of large jellyfish ""L"". Then, a third of L is the number of large jellyfish that change color, which is 6. 

So, L/3 = 6
Multiplying both sides by 3, we get L = 18. This means there are 18 large jellyfish.

Since a fifth of the total jellyfish are large, and there are 18 large jellyfish, we can set up an equation to find the total number of jellyfish. Let's call the total number of jellyfish ""T"". Then, a fifth of T is 18.

So, T/5 = 18
Multiplying both sides by 5, we get T = 90.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

The final answer is: 90"

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Lauren needs to save for retirement and then determine how many years it will take her to save that amount.

First, let's calculate Lauren's current annual savings. Since she saves 20% of her $100,000 salary, her annual savings will be:

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Next, we need to calculate how much she will need for retirement. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current salary, her retirement expenses will be:

40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

Since she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, she will need:

$40,000 * 20 years = $800,000 for retirement.

Now, we need to calculate how many years it will take her to save $800,000 at a rate of $20,000 per year:

$800,000 / $20,000 per year = 40 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for retirement, but we need to subtract the 20 years she plans to live in retirement. 

40 years - 20 years = 20 years.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts it will be cut into. 

First, we divide the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to divide the number of boys by the percentage of boys. 

First, we convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 40% = 40 / 100 = 0.4

Then, we divide the number of boys by this decimal: 240 / 0.4 = 600

This means the total number of students in the school is 600. 

To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students: 600 - 240 = 360

So, there are 360 girls in the school.

The three women wearing 4 inch heels have a total height of 3 x 4 = 12 inches.
The three women wearing 2 inch heels have a total height of 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.
There are 6 women in total.

The average height of heels is 18 / 6 = 3 inches."
"To find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we need to first find out how many days she has in June. June has 30 days. 

Since she wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can divide 9,300 by 30 to find out how many miles she needs to hike per day. 

9,300 / 30 = 310 miles per day.

Since she already plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, we need to find out how many miles she will hike in total per day. 

125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

Now, we need to subtract the miles she will hike per day from the total miles she needs to hike per day to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day.

310 - 250 = 60 miles per day.

The final answer is: 60"

We know the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. 

To find out the number of blinks per minute, we divide the total number of blinks by the total number of minutes: 
255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now that we know the light blinks 51 times per minute, we can find out how many minutes it will take to blink 459 times by dividing the total number of blinks by the number of blinks per minute:
459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes.

"To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the other 4 workers. 

2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, so together they produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys an hour. 
2 workers produce 4 toys an hour, so together they produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys an hour. 
So, the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers is 12 + 8 = 20 toys an hour.

Since all 5 workers work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers in 10 hours is 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, so the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in 10 hours is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Since the 4 workers produce 200 toys in 10 hours, the fifth worker must produce 380 - 200 = 180 toys in 10 hours.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker in 10 hours by 10. 
180 / 10 = 18.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds. So, Elijah's first dog weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds. So, Elijah's second dog weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's two dogs together: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. This means Luis has half of Seth's stickers, and Seth has half of his stickers left.
2. Luis used half of the stickers he received and gave the rest to Kris. This means Kris has half of the stickers Luis received, and Luis has half of the stickers he received.
3. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. This means Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.

Now, let's work backwards to find out how many stickers Luis had:

Kris had 16 stickers, which is half of what Luis had. So, Luis had 16 x 2 = 32 stickers.

Luis had 32 stickers, which is half of what Seth had. So, Seth had 32 x 2 = 64 stickers.

He buys 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each, so he has 3 x 10 = 30 ounces of M&M's.

Since an ounce of M&M's has 30 M&M's, he has 30 x 30 = 900 M&M's.

Now, we need to find out how many small bags he can make. Each small bag has 10 M&M's, so we divide the total number of M&M's by 10.

900 / 10 = 90

So, John can make 90 small bags of M&M's."

The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, which is 120 miles per hour. 

Speed of the 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.

The faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. 

Speed of the faster car = 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Liam is 16 years old now. Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. So, two years ago, Vince's age was 14 / 2 = 7 years old.

To find Vince's current age, we need to add 2 years to his age two years ago. Vince's current age is 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's call that number A.
- Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.
- Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted S. Then, Camden painted S + 12 eggs.

We know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so we can write an equation:

S + (S + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:

2S + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:

2S = 18

Divide both sides by 2:

S = 9

So Sarah painted 9 eggs. Since Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

We also know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. We can write an equation:

A + A + 21 + 9 = 56

Combine like terms:

2A + 30 = 56

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2A = 26

Divide both sides by 2:

A = 13

So Arnold painted 13 eggs. Camden painted 21 eggs, so Camden painted 21 - 13 = 8 more eggs than Arnold.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to find the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes, then add them together.

First, let's find the total weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 200 crayons, we need to find out how many boxes he will need. To do this, we divide 200 by 8, which is 25. So Nik will need 25 boxes.

The total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, we add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes. 200 (crayons) + 200 (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, we need to divide 400 by 16 to find the total weight in pounds. 400 / 16 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to find 80% of 80 feet. 

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet, we need to divide 64 by 4 to find the number of logs.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

Now, we know John can make 16 logs and from each log, he can make 5 planks. So, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log.

16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

John sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is 1/2 of what her brother earns. 
   So, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

2. Their combined salary is $5000 (Valerie) + $10,000 (brother) = $15,000 per month.

3. Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

4. To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual salaries: 
   $5000 (Valerie) + $10,000 (brother) + $30,000 (mother) = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. 
2. On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. 
3. Let's assume her speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.
4. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach, it will take her 2/x minutes to complete the beach part of the walk.
5. Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, it will take her 1/(2x) minutes to complete the sidewalk part of the walk.
6. The total time spent on the beach is 40 minutes. So, 2/x = 40. 
7. Solving for x, we get x = 1/20 miles per minute.
8. Now, we can find the time taken to walk on the sidewalk: 1/(2x) = 1/(2 * 1/20) = 1/0.1 = 10 minutes.
9. The total time taken to complete the entire 3-mile walk is the sum of the time taken for the beach and the sidewalk: 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save $60, we need to first find out how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so we multiply the amount she saves per week by the number of weeks: 
$4 * 8 = $32

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60. 
$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we need to divide the amount she still needs to save by the amount she saves per week to find out how many more weeks it will take:
$28 / $4 = 7

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60. 

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree. 

3 trees had 7 blue birds each, so that's 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.
2 trees had 4 blue birds each, so that's 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.
1 tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add them together: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles and has 60 marbles, we need to find out how many marbles he had initially. Since 1 dozen is 12, 2 dozen is 2 x 12 = 24. 

So, if he receives 24 more marbles and has 60, we can set up an equation to find the initial number of marbles: 

Initial marbles + 24 = 60

To find the initial number of marbles, we need to subtract 24 from 60: 

Initial marbles = 60 - 24
Initial marbles = 36

Now, we know Bob initially had 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from 36 to find the final number of marbles he has:

36 - 10 = 26

So, Bob will have 26 marbles.

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle. 

Let's say the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the two temperatures. 

The total amount of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle). 

The average temperature of the water in the bottle is (33 + x) / 2.

Since Donny can now drink the water, the average temperature must be at least 40 degrees.

We can set up the inequality:

(33 + x) / 2 ≥ 40

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:

33 + x ≥ 80

Subtract 33 from both sides:

x ≥ 47

So, the second bottle must be at least 47 degrees.

The final answer is: 47"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows

Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
= 470 cows + 230 chickens
= 700 animals

"To find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels, we need to multiply the cost of one pack by 4. 

Cost of one pack = $10.00
Total cost of 4 packs = 10 * 4 = $40.00

Since Russell will receive a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $40.00 and subtract it from the total cost.

10% of $40.00 = 0.1 * 40 = $4.00
Discount = $4.00
Total cost after discount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Now, we need to find the total number of bagels in 4 packs. 

Number of bagels in one pack = 9
Total number of bagels in 4 packs = 9 * 4 = 36

To find the cost of each single bagel, we need to divide the total cost after discount by the total number of bagels.

Cost of each single bagel = Total cost after discount / Total number of bagels
= $36.00 / 36
= $1.00

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate, we need to first find out how many scoops 1 potato makes. 

It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, which is 2 scoops. 

Now, we know that 3 potatoes make 2 scoops. To find out how many scoops 1 potato makes, we divide 2 scoops by 3 potatoes. 2 scoops / 3 potatoes = 2/3 scoops per potato.

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, Gomer ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Since 1 potato makes 2/3 scoops of mashed potatoes, to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we divide the total scoops by 2/3. 18 scoops / (2/3) = 18 * (3/2) = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens: 240 eggs / 12 = 20.

- There are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, so there are 2 * 17 = 34 red jellybeans.
- The total number of jellybeans is 60.

To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)

He has 5 trees and each tree gives him 6 lemons per year. So, the total number of lemons he gets in a year is 5 * 6 = 30 lemons.

Since a decade is 10 years, we multiply the number of lemons he gets in a year by 10. 

30 * 10 = 300

So, Tim gets 300 lemons in a decade."
"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 9 = 14. 

We can set up a proportion to find the number of women on the bus: 

Number of women / Total number of passengers = 9 / 14
Number of women = (9 / 14) * Total number of passengers
Number of women = (9 / 14) * 84
Number of women = 54

Now, 20 women alight from the bus. To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women:

Number of women who remained = Initial number of women - Number of women who alighted
Number of women who remained = 54 - 20
Number of women who remained = 34

"Let's break down the information given:

- The cost of a sunflower is $2.
- The cost of a bouquet is $8, which contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earns $26 from sunflowers per day.
- Faraday earns $56 from bouquets per day.

First, let's find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold per day. Since he earns $26 from sunflowers per day, and each sunflower costs $2, we can divide $26 by $2 to get the number of sunflowers sold per day.

$26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers per day

Now, let's find out how many bouquets Faraday sold per day. Since he earns $56 from bouquets per day, and each bouquet costs $8, we can divide $56 by $8 to get the number of bouquets sold per day.

$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply the number of bouquets sold per day by 12 to get the number of sunflowers sold from bouquets per day.

7 bouquets/day * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers/day

Now, we add the number of sunflowers sold per day from both sources to get the total number of sunflowers sold per day.

13 sunflowers/day + 84 sunflowers/day = 97 sunflowers/day

Finally, we multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by the number of days to get the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.

97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers

"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to first find out how many rocks he buys, how much he sells, and then the difference between what he spent and what he earned.

Adam has $100 to spend on rocks, and each rock costs $5. 

Number of rocks he buys = Total money / Price per rock
= $100 / $5
= 20 rocks

He sells 60% of his inventory, which is 60% of 20 rocks.
60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20
= 12 rocks

He sells each rock for $7, so the total money he earns is:
Total money earned = Number of rocks sold * Price per rock
= 12 * $7
= $84

He spent $100 to buy the rocks, but only earned $84. To find out how much he loses, we subtract the money he earned from the money he spent:
Money lost = Money spent - Money earned

"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of large, medium, and small-sized picture scenes Lauren needs to draw. 

First, let's find the LCM of 45, 36, and 49. 

The prime factorization of 45 is 3^2 * 5.
The prime factorization of 36 is 2^2 * 3^2.
The prime factorization of 49 is 7^2.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
LCM = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5 * 7^2 = 4 * 9 * 5 * 49 = 8820

Now, let's find out how many days it will take Lauren to draw each type of picture scene:

Since Carla has 8 babies and 3/4 of them are wearing purple, we can find the number of purple babies by multiplying 8 by 3/4. 

8 * 3/4 = 6

So, 6 babies are wearing purple. 

Now, 1/4 of the babies are wearing blue, so we can find the number of blue babies by multiplying 8 by 1/4.

8 * 1/4 = 2

So, 2 babies are wearing blue.

Now, we are told that all the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows. We already know that 2 babies are wearing blue, so we need to find 1/3 of the purple babies.

1/3 of 6 is 2. 

So, 2 purple babies and 2 blue babies are wearing bows. 

Now, we need to find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. To do this, we can divide the number of purple babies wearing bows by the total number of babies wearing bows and multiply by 100.

"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he earned from selling the land.

First, let's find out how much land he sold in the first two transactions.

He sold half of the land for $50, so he sold 80 / 2 = 40 square meters of land for $50.

Then, he sold 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he had 80 square meters initially, 1/4 of 80 is 20 square meters. 

So, he sold 40 + 20 = 60 square meters of land in the first two transactions.

Now, let's find out how much land is left. He had 80 square meters initially and sold 60 square meters, so he has 80 - 60 = 20 square meters left.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, he earned 20 * 3 = $60 from the remaining land.

Now, let's add up the money he earned from all the transactions. He earned $50 from the first transaction, $30 from the second transaction, and $60 from the third transaction.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

There were 3 dozen eggs hidden initially, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments and the total amount of money he gets paid per week.

First, let's find the total number of apartments in the first two complexes: 
200 + 200 = 400 apartments

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400:
60% of 400 = 0.6 * 400 = 240
Total apartments in the last complex = 400 + 240 = 640
Total apartments in all complexes = 400 + 640 = 1040

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is:
1040 * 3 = 3120 collections per week

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so the total amount of money he makes per week is:
3120 * 0.40 = $1248

The final answer is: $1248"
"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree, we need to calculate the fruits produced each year and add them up.

- Year 1: 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
- Year 2: 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- Year 3: 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- Year 4: The tree is now 8 years old, but we don't know how many fruits it produces yet. We need to find out how many fruits a 10-year-old tree produces first.
- Year 5: The tree is still 8 years old, so it produces the same amount as in year 4.
- Year 6: The tree is now 9 years old, so it produces the same amount as in year 4.
- Year 7: The tree is now 10 years old, and it produces 20 times the initial amount, so 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.
- Year 8: The tree is now 11 years old, but we don't need to consider this year because the problem only asks for the total fruits produced during the 10 years of life.
- Year 9: The tree doesn't produce any fruit.
- Year 10: The tree is now 11 years old, but we don't need to consider this year because the problem only asks for the total fruits produced during the 10 years of life.

Now, let's find out how many fruits a 10-year-old tree produces. We know that an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. So, a 10-year-old tree produces 200 + 200 = 400 fruits more than an 8-year-old tree. Since an 8-year-old tree is 3 times the initial amount, it produces 3 * 50 = 150 fruits. Therefore, a 10-year-old tree produces 150 + 400 = 550 fruits.

Now, let's calculate the total fruits produced by the tree in the first 4 years:
- Year 1: 50 fruits
- Year 2: 150 fruits
- Year 3: 350 fruits
- Year 4: 150 fruits (since an 8-year-old tree produces 150 fruits)

Total fruits in the first 4 years: 50 + 150 + 350 + 150 = 600 fruits

Since the tree doesn't produce any fruit in the 9th year, we don't need to add any fruits for that year.

Now, let's calculate the total fruits produced by the tree in the last 2 years:
- Year 7: 1000 fruits
- Year 10: 550 fruits

Total fruits in the last 2 years: 1000 + 550 = 1550 fruits

Now, let's add the total fruits produced in the first 4 years and the last 2 years:
Total fruits = 600 + 1550 = 2150 fruits

The final answer is: 2150"
"To find out how much money Jack has now, we need to first calculate how much money Sophia gave him. Sophia has $100 and she gave 1/5 of it to Jack. 

1/5 of $100 is calculated as: $100 * (1/5) = $20

Now, we add the money Sophia gave Jack to the money Jack already had: $100 + $20 = $120

So, Jack now has $120."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The red rope is 4 times the length of the blue rope.
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.
3. The total length of the 3 ropes is 37 centimeters.

Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R.

From point 2, we can write an equation: B = Y - 7.

From point 1, we can write another equation: R = 4B.

We can also write an equation for the total length: R + B + Y = 37.

Now, substitute B from the first equation into the second equation: R = 4(Y - 7).

Now we have two equations with two variables: 
R = 4(Y - 7) 
R + B + Y = 37

Substitute B from the first equation into the second equation: 
R + (Y - 7) + Y = 37

Combine like terms: 
R + 2Y - 7 = 37

Now substitute R from the first equation into the equation above: 
4(Y - 7) + 2Y - 7 = 37

Expand the equation: 
4Y - 28 + 2Y - 7 = 37

Combine like terms: 
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides: 
6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6: 
Y = 12

Now that we have the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope: 
B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Now that we have the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope: 
R = 4B
R = 4 * 5
R = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Ronnie was given x dollars. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3x dollars.

After they both gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, Ronnie is left with x - y dollars and Rissa is left with 3x - y dollars, where y is the amount they both gave to their little sister.

We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

3x - y = (4/5)(3x)

To solve for y, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

15x - 5y = 12x

Now, let's isolate y by subtracting 12x from both sides:

15x - 12x - 5y = 12x - 12x
3x - 5y = 0

Now, let's add 5y to both sides:

3x = 5y

Now, let's divide both sides by 5:

(3/5)x = y

Now, let's substitute this expression for y into the equation for Ronnie's remaining money:

x - y = x - (3/5)x
x - (3/5)x = x - (3/5)x
(2/5)x = x - (3/5)x
(2/5)x = (2/5)x

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

There are four colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow. It's mentioned that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint. This means that the amount of red paint is equal to the amount of white paint, and the amount of white paint is equal to the amount of purple paint.

Let's represent the amount of red paint as R, the amount of white paint as W, and the amount of purple paint as P. Since they are equal, we can say R = W = P.

It's also mentioned that half the mural is yellow paint. This means that the amount of yellow paint is half of the total amount of paint used, which is 12 pints. So, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and we know that the amount of yellow paint is 6 pints, the remaining paint is used for red, white, and purple. The total amount of red, white, and purple paint is 12 - 6 = 6 pints.

Since R = W = P, we can say that the total amount of red, white, and purple paint is 3R (since R = W = P). We know that 3R = 6 pints.

To find the amount of red paint, we need to solve for R. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation 3R = 6 by 3. 

R = 6 / 3
R = 2

"To find the total area of the house, we need to find the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, we add the areas together: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box, we need to first find out how many pods are in the new box. 

The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. 20% of 100 is 0.2 x 100 = 20. So the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we know that the new box costs $12 and has 120 pods. To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the number of pods by the cost. 

First, we need to find out how many pods you can get for $1. Since the new box costs $12 for 120 pods, you can get 120 / 12 = 10 pods for $1.

Now, we know that you can get 10 pods for $1. Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 10 cycles for $1."
"Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, so he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, so he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills. He is left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

He triples his money, so he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, and each bill is now 5 dollars, he now has 60 * 5 = 300 dollars in 5 dollar bills.

So, in the first half, team A scores 4 goals and team B scores 2 goals. In the second half, team A scores 2 goals and team B scores 8 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 + 2 = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16."
"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to find out how much chalk is left after Monday and then divide it by the amount of chalk used each day.

The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of it. 

45% of 5 inches is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.

So, after Monday, 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk is left.

The teacher now uses 20% of the chalk each day. To find out how many days the chalk will last, we need to divide the remaining chalk by the amount used each day.

20% of 5 inches is 0.2 * 5 = 1 inch.

Now, we divide the remaining chalk by the amount used each day: 2.75 / 1 = 2.75 days.

The final answer is: 2.75"
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to find the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4. 
One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to first find out how many face masks Mike bought, then multiply that by 3 and add 2.

Mike bought 5 face masks. 

Thrice as many as Mike is 3 * 5 = 15. 

2 more than 15 is 15 + 2 = 17.

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to first find out how many teeth the dentist fixes in total. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth. 
The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to divide the number of teeth the dentist fixes by the total number of James' teeth and multiply by 100.

Percentage = (15 / 30) * 100
= 0.5 * 100
= 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much Mr. Marcellus got in refunds, we need to first find out how many gallons of milk were expired. 

2/5 of 4000 gallons is (2/5) * 4000 = 1600 gallons.

Since Mr. Marcellus bought the milk at $3.5 per gallon, the total amount he got in refunds is 1600 * $3.5.

1600 * $3.5 = $5600

So, Mr. Marcellus got $5600 in refunds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Colin's current age is C and Wendy's current age is W.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for C.

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

To simplify, multiply both sides by 3:

3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7)

Expand the equation:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtract 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtract 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Divide both sides by 2:

20 = C

So Colin is 20 years old now.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy in total, we need to divide the total amount of money he has ($27000) by the cost of 100 books ($500). 

$27000 / $500 = 54

Since Bob is distributing the money to 3 schools, we need to divide the total number of books he can buy by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school.

54 / 3 = 18

So, Bob can buy 18 books per school."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Newton started with 2 apples.
2. He threw 1 apple back into the tree, which caused 5 more apples to fall out. So, he now has 2 (initial apples) + 5 (new apples) = 7 apples.
3. He put all but 1 of these 7 apples in his pocket, so he has 1 apple left. 
4. He threw the remaining apple at the tree, which caused 6 more apples to fall out. So, he now has 1 (remaining apple) + 6 (new apples) = 7 apples.
5. He picked up all the remaining apples, which is 7 apples.

So, Newton brought home 7 apples."
"To find the total cost of Ali's order, we need to find out how many 50 kg bags of coal he ordered and multiply that by the cost per bag.

First, we need to divide the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight per bag (50 kg) to find the number of bags:

850 kg / 50 kg per bag = 17 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag ($18):

17 bags * $18 per bag = $306

The final answer is: $306"
"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza that her friends will eat. 

For cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices. 

For pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices.

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, Kate will need to buy 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 cheese pizzas. 

Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, Kate will need to buy 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

So, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

The total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is 3 + 3 = 6."
"To find the total miles Sam ran, we need to add the miles he ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and the miles he ran on Tuesday and Thursday.

Miles run on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday: 3 miles * 3 days = 9 miles

"To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. So, his rate of building snowballs is 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. So, the rate at which snowballs melt is 2/15 snowballs per minute.

To find the net rate of snowballs, we subtract the rate of melting from the rate of building: (1/3) - (2/15) = (5/15) - (2/15) = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. We can set up the equation:

(1/5) * t = 60

To solve for t, we multiply both sides by 5:

t = 60 * 5
t = 300

So, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find out how old Jim was 20 years ago, we need to subtract 20 from John's current age. 

John's current age is 28. 
20 years ago, John's age was 28 - 20 = 8.

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can find Jim's age by dividing John's age 20 years ago by 2.

Jim's age 20 years ago was 8 / 2 = 4.

To find Jim's current age, we need to add 20 to his age 20 years ago.

Jim's current age is 4 + 20 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many slices of apple they ate, we need to figure out how many slices each person ate. 

Doxa ate 1 slice. 
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. 
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, we add up the slices each person ate: 
Doxa ate 1 slice, her sister ate 2 slices, and her brother ate 3 slices. 
1 + 2 + 3 = 6 slices.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the information given:

- On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 1 pack of 50.
- On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
- On the third day, they ordered 2 packs of 50 bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages.
- They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x. 

After the first day, they had x - 38 bandages left.
After the second day, they had (x - 38) - 28 = x - 66 bandages left.
After the third day, they had (x - 66) - 25 + 100 (2 packs of 50) = x - 66 - 25 + 100 = x + 9 bandages left.

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so we can set up the equation:
x + 9 = 78

To solve for x, we subtract 9 from both sides of the equation:
x = 78 - 9
x = 69

The initial number of bandages they started with on the first day is 69.

The final answer is: 69"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color separately, then add them together.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch. May's hair was 10 inches long initially and ended at 8 inches. So, the length of hair cut is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60.

The cost of the color is $40.

The total cost is $60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100.

"To find out how much Jen will receive, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total earnings. 

First, let's find out how many hours Jen works in a week. 
Jen works 7.5 hours a day and 6 days a week. 
So, total hours worked in a week = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week

Since there are 4 weeks in April, we need to find out how many hours Jen works in April. 
Total hours worked in April = 45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Now, let's find out Jen's total earnings without the attendance bonus. 
Jen's hourly rate is $1.5. 
So, total earnings without bonus = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

"To find out how much John spent on everything, we need to calculate the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately and then add them together.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $600 / 10 = $60 per bottle.

The number of bottles of cognac is twice the number of bottles of scotch, which is 2 * 10 = 20 bottles.

The cost of the cognac is 50% more than the scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $60 + $30 = $90 per bottle.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 bottles * $90 per bottle = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, so he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total number of White Oak trees is 20 + 10 = 30. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days. The total number of White Oak trees is 20 + 30 = 50. The total number of Lodgepole Pine trees is 40 + 50 = 90.

"To find the total volume of the jar, we need to multiply the length, width, and height of the jar. 

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume used by the jelly beans will be 80% of the total volume. 

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of one jelly bean.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people.

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first stop, 3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30. So, 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. The total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for the first 5 years and the cost of visits for the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the cost per year is 2 * 3 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 6 * 5 = $30.

The cost of one visit increased by 150% after 5 years. A 150% increase means the new cost is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = $5. The cost per year is 5 * 3 = $15. For 3 years, the total cost is 15 * 3 = $45.

The total cost for all visits is 30 + 45 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to find out how many groups of 8 students can be made from 10 students in each grade. 

There are 4 grades (4-7) with 10 students in each grade. So, the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40 students.

Since each group has 8 students, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find out how many groups can be made. 

40 students / 8 students per group = 5 groups.

Since each group takes 45 minutes, we need to multiply the number of groups by the time it takes for each group to try the escape room.

5 groups * 45 minutes per group = 225 minutes.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the tables and the total cost of the roof frames, then add them together.

The cost of the tables is 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.
The cost of the roof frames is 2 frames * $10 per frame = $20.

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames together: $80 + $20 = $100.

So, Ali has to pay John $100."
"Let's say the shorter piece is x feet long. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the longer piece is 4x feet long.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, so the sum of the two pieces is 40 feet. We can write an equation to represent this:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

So the shorter piece is 8 feet long. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the longer piece is 4x = 4(8) = 32 feet long.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to find out how many pounds of meat he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the number of pounds of meat he needs.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of meat

Now that we know he needs 5 pounds of meat, and he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of meat, we can multiply the number of pounds by the amount of seasoning per pound.

5 pounds of meat * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for the cookout.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the width of one window by the number of windows. 

Width of one window = 35 inches
Number of windows = 5

Total width of windows = 35 * 5 = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the total width by 2.

Fabric needed = 2 * 175 = 350 inches

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the total cost of the call, we need to calculate the cost for the first 16 minutes and the cost for the remaining minutes. 

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is 16 * $0.25 = $4.

"To find out how much rain will fall on Tuesday, we need to first calculate twice the amount of rain that fell on Monday. 

Monday's rain: 2 inches
Twice of Monday's total: 2 x 2 = 4 inches

It's expected to rain 1 more inch than twice of Monday's total, so we add 1 to the result: 
4 + 1 = 5 inches

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let's say the number of cupcakes Carly made is C. Since she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, the number of brownies she made is 3C - 2.

We know that each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. So, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies. So, we can write the equation: C + (3C - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4C - 2 = 10.

Add 2 to both sides: 4C = 12.

Divide both sides by 4: C = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount, and then add the cost of the nail art.

The original cost of the manicure and pedicure is $35 + $40 = $75.

The discount is 20% of $75, which is 0.2 x $75 = $15.

So, the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers, the total cost of the nail art is 10 x $3 = $30.

The total cost is the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of the nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues from the first 3 magazines and the last magazine.

The first 3 magazines send 12 issues a year each, so that's 3 x 12 = 36 issues.

The second magazine sends 6 issues a year.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 x 6 = 24 issues.

Now, let's add up all the issues: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan gets 66 magazines every year."

"To find the price of the toy after it was discounted in January, we need to follow the steps:

1. The price of the toy in November is $40.
2. In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.8 (100% + 80% = 180%, or 1 + 1.8 = 2.8, then 40 * 2.8 = 112).
3. In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we multiply the price in December by 0.5 (100% - 50% = 50%, or 1 - 0.5 = 0.5, then 112 * 0.5 = 56).

The final price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $56."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make, we need to calculate the amount he makes from the standard lessons and the amount he makes from the lessons with the veteran.

For the standard lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. So, the total amount from standard lessons is 4 x $80 = $320.

For the lessons with the veteran, Charlie reduces his rate by 25%. This means he charges 75% of his standard rate. 75% of $80 is 0.75 x $80 = $60. He has 2 lessons with the veteran, so the total amount from the veteran lessons is 2 x $60 = $120.

Now, we add the amount from the standard lessons and the veteran lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make. $320 + $120 = $440.

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up all the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The sum of all the scores is 630.

Next, we need to count the total number of scores, which is 9.

Now, we divide the sum of the scores by the total number of scores to find the mean:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first find out how many pomelos she had left. Since she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had, we can calculate this by multiplying the original number of pomelos by 1/4.

Original number of pomelos = 20
Number of pomelos left = 20 * 1/4 = 5

Now, we know Eve had 5 pomelos left. To find out how many she gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos left from the original number of pomelos.

Number of pomelos given away = Original number of pomelos - Number of pomelos left

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, we need to find out how many apples were left. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we need to find out how many apples Walter gave to his sister. 25% of 36 is 0.25 * 36 = 9.

So, Walter gave 9 apples to his sister. Now, we need to find out how many apples were left.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. 
Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 6 x 5 = 30 grapes.

Now, we have the total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother, which is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie requires 12 grapes, so she used 4 x 12 = 48 grapes.

Now, we have the total number of grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and her mother, which is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

Since the total number of grapes used is 84, and we want to find the initial number of grapes, we need to add the grapes that were used to the grapes that were left. However, we don't know how many grapes were left. 

Let's denote the initial number of grapes as x. The number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 36, and the number of grapes used by her mother is 48. The number of grapes left is x - 36 - 48. 

Since their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, the number of grapes left must be a multiple of 4 (because each pie requires 12 grapes). The number of grapes left is x - 84, and it must be a multiple of 4.

x - 84 must be a multiple of 4. The smallest multiple of 4 that is greater than 0 is 4. So, x - 84 = 4. 

x = 88.

"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients for one batch and then multiply it by the number of batches he makes in a year.

The cost of pasta is $1.00 per box.
The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00.
The cost of gruyere cheese is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

The total cost of one batch of macaroni and cheese is $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00.

Since Bud makes homemade macaroni and cheese once a week, he makes 52 batches in a year (52 weeks in a year).

The total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one year is 52 batches * $10.00 per batch = $520.00.

"To find the total number of classrooms the custodian needs to clean, we already know that number is 80. 

The custodian has 5 days to clean the classrooms. To find the total number of minutes they have to clean, we multiply the number of days by the number of hours they work per day and then multiply that by 60 to convert hours to minutes. 

5 days * 8 hours/day = 40 hours
40 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 2400 minutes

Now, we divide the total minutes by the number of minutes it takes to clean one classroom to find the total number of classrooms they can clean in that time. 

2400 minutes / 15 minutes/classroom = 160 classrooms

Since they have to clean 80 classrooms, they can't clean 160 classrooms in the given time. They will clean 80 classrooms in 5 days. 

To find the total minutes they spend cleaning classrooms, we multiply the number of classrooms by the minutes per classroom. 

80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Now, we divide the total minutes spent cleaning by the total minutes available to find the percentage of their day spent cleaning. 

(1200 minutes / 2400 minutes) * 100 = 50%

"Let's break down the information given:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books that one bookcase can hold: 
10 (middle shelf) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 45 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases she needs to hold all of them. To do this, we'll divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold:
110 / 45 = 2.44

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Elly needs 3 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To find Rose's profit, we need to first find out how much she paid for the eggs and how much she will get from selling them.

Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs. Since 1 dozen is 12 eggs, 5 dozens will be 5 x 12 = 60 eggs.

The cost of 5 dozens of eggs is $2.40. So, the cost of 1 dozen eggs is $2.40 / 5 = $0.48.

Now, let's find out how much Rose will get from selling the eggs. She will sell 3 eggs for $1. So, the cost of 1 egg is $1 / 3 = $0.33.

Now, let's find out how much Rose will get from selling 60 eggs. The cost of 1 egg is $0.33, so the cost of 60 eggs is 60 x $0.33 = $20.

Now, let's find out how much profit Rose will make. The cost of 60 eggs is $2.40 x 5 = $12. The selling price of 60 eggs is $20. So, the profit is $20 - $12 = $8.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's find the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 is 4, so 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each.

The number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.
The number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the rest of the week.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people on the third day is 2 * 70 = 140.

The total number of people on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week, the total number of people he saw on the rest of the week is 60 * 4 = 240.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500.

"To find the total number of popcorn pieces, we need to calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval and add them up.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial popping rate popped, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels popped.

So, the total number of kernels that popped in the four 30-second intervals is 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200.

However, we also need to add the kernels that popped from the residual heat. A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds popped from the residual heat, so 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels.

The total number of popcorn pieces Garrett has to eat is 200 + 10 = 210."
"To find out how many lemons Tim will need, we first need to find out how many cups of lemon juice he needs for 5 gallons of lemonade.

First, let's find the total amount of food the German Shepherds consume in a week. There are 3 German Shepherds and each consumes 5 kilograms of food per day. 

3 German Shepherds * 5 kilograms/day = 15 kilograms/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7.

15 kilograms/day * 7 days = 105 kilograms

Next, let's find the total amount of food the Bulldogs consume in a week. There are 2 Bulldogs and each consumes 3 kilograms of food per day.

2 Bulldogs * 3 kilograms/day = 6 kilograms/day

Multiply the daily consumption by 7.

6 kilograms/day * 7 days = 42 kilograms

Now, we add the total amount of food the German Shepherds and Bulldogs consume in a week.

105 kilograms + 42 kilograms = 147 kilograms

The total amount of dog food needed in a week is 147 kilograms."
"To find the total number of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals and the 4-legged animals separately and then add them together.

For the 2-legged animals, each animal has 2 legs. So, the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals is 10 * 2 = 20.

For the 4-legged animals, each animal has 4 legs. So, the total number of legs from the 4-legged animals is 15 * 4 = 60.

"To find out how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled. 

First, let's find the distance he traveled west. Distance = Speed * Time. 
Distance = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles.

Then, let's find the distance he traveled east. Distance = Speed * Time. 
Distance = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to subtract the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east to find the total distance from his house. 
Total distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles.

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

Initial value of the boat = $9000

Depreciation in the first year = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Depreciation in the second year = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Depreciation in the third year = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after the third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first find the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We know there are 54 red candies. 
The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so orange candies = 2 * 54 = 108.
The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so yellow candies = 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we know the total number of candies is 232. 
We can find the total number of non-pink candies by adding the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 
Total non-pink candies = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

Now, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total non-pink candies from the total number of candies: 
Pink candies = 232 - 189 = 43.

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + (75 * 2)
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to find 1% of 1600.

1% of 1600 = (1/100) * 1600
1% of 1600 = 0.01 * 1600
1% of 1600 = 16

Perimeter = 2(35)
Perimeter = 70

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to go around the entire fence."
"To find the average age of Mia and Emma, we need to know their ages. We know Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age. 

Since Mia is younger than Emma, we can add 16 to Mia's age to find Emma's age. 
Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now that we know both their ages, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

So, he has 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies, 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies.

Then, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. 
So, he has 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies, 3 chocolate chip cookies, and 4 sugar cookies.

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. 
So, he has 6 oatmeal cookies, 3 chocolate chip cookies, and 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies.

Then, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. 
So, he now has 6 + 4 = 10 oatmeal cookies, 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies.

Now, let's add up all the cookies: 10 + 7 + 6 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get for the first half of the collection and the second half separately, then add them together.

Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, so half of them would be 12 / 2 = 6.

For the first half, he would get $5 per toy, so 6 toys * $5 = $30.

For the second half, he would get $7 per toy, so 6 toys * $7 = $42.

Now, we add the two amounts together: $30 + $42 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"To find the total number of holes dug by the dog, we need to multiply the number of holes dug per day by the number of days Nate was on vacation. 

Holes dug per day = 6
Days Nate was on vacation = 14
Total holes dug = 6 * 14 = 84

Now, we need to find out how many holes are filled in per day. 

Holes filled in per day = 9
New holes dug per day = 6

Net holes filled in per day = 9 - 6 = 3

To find the total number of days it takes to fill in all the holes, we need to divide the total number of holes by the net holes filled in per day.

Total holes = 84
Net holes filled in per day = 3
Total days = 84 / 3 = 28

Since we need to find the number of weeks, we need to divide the total days by 7.

Total days = 28
Weeks = 28 / 7 = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the average enrollment at Butler High School, we need to multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4.

Average enrollment at Norman High School = 4000 students
Average enrollment at Butler High School = 3/4 * 4000
= 3 * 1000
= 3000 students

Now, we need to find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School.

Difference in enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

First, let's add the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies:
2595 + 3075 = 5670

Now, let's subtract the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies:
7995 - 5670 = 2325

So, the Adams family made 2325 chocolate chip cookies. 

2325"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
- He gathered two more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
- He gathered the correct number of beakers, which is 7.
- The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

8 (test tubes) + 7 (beakers) + 16 (Petri dishes) + x (beakers lost) = 29

Combine the known quantities:
8 + 7 + 16 = 31

Now, subtract 31 from both sides of the equation to isolate x:
31 + x = 29
x = 29 - 31
x = -2

However, since we can't have a negative number of beakers lost, this means that Igor actually had 2 more beakers than he lost. So, the number of beakers he lost is 7 - 2 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws he will use and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, he will need 4 x 8 = 32 screws in total.

James has 40 screws, and he will use 32 screws, so he will have 40 - 32 = 8 screws left over.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to find the number of eggs in the second basket and add it to the number of eggs in the first basket.

The first basket has 10 eggs. 
The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, so it has 2 x 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to find the amount raised by each person and add them together.

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430. So, Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. So, Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we add the amounts raised by each person: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron.
- Vanessa ran 4 miles.
- Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if Vanessa runs 4 miles, Aaron would run half the distance, which is 4 / 2 = 2 miles.

Since Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and he ran 2 miles, we can find his speed by dividing the time by the distance: 16 minutes / 2 miles = 8 minutes per mile.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's speed, which is 8 / 2 = 4 minutes per mile.

Now, we can find the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race by multiplying her speed by the distance: 4 minutes per mile * 4 miles = 16 minutes.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs, we need to calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. 

Since he needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3. 

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line needed.

However, the caretaker already has 6 feet of line. So, we need to subtract the amount he already has from the total amount needed.

600 feet of line needed - 6 feet of line already owned = 594 feet of line needed to buy.

The final answer is: 594"
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate their daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

Daily earnings = (2 meals * $5) + $5 (bottle of wine)
Daily earnings = (2 * $5) + $5
Daily earnings = $10 + $5
Daily earnings = $15

Since they are open 2 days a week, we multiply the daily earnings by 2.

Weekly earnings = Daily earnings * 2
Weekly earnings = $15 * 2
Weekly earnings = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"To find the cost of each watermelon, we need to first find the total selling price of all the watermelons. 

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. To find the selling price, we need to add a 25% profit to the cost price. 

First, let's find 25% of $80. 
25% of $80 = (25/100) * 80 = $20

Now, add the profit to the cost price to get the selling price. 
Selling price = Cost price + Profit
Selling price = $80 + $20
Selling price = $100

Now, we know the total selling price is $100 and the vendor sold 50 watermelons. To find the cost of each watermelon, we need to divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons. 
Cost of each watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
Cost of each watermelon = $100 / 50
Cost of each watermelon = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the current age of James, we need to find Dora's current age first. Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had James when he was 19, so the time that has passed since John had James is 18 - 19 = -1 year. However, since age cannot be negative, this means that John must have had James when John was 18 years old. 

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the time that has passed since his birth is 32 - 18 = 14 years.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 14 + 3 = 17 years old.

The final answer is: 17"
"Let's break this problem down step by step.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, and Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes. To find out how many oranges they can peel in an hour (60 minutes), we need to divide 60 by the time it takes each of them to peel an orange.

For Ana: 60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges
For Jane: 60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges

Now, we need to find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane. To do this, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peeled from the number of oranges Ana peeled.

20 (Ana's oranges) - 15 (Jane's oranges) = 5

So, Ana will have 5 more oranges peeled than Jane after an hour.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how much Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor cost.

First, let's find the cost of the radiator. The original price is $400, but Mark gets it for 80% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by 80% (or 0.8).

Cost of radiator = $400 * 0.8 = $320

Next, let's find the labor cost. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour.

Labor cost = 3 hours * $50/hour = $150

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid.

Total cost = Cost of radiator + Labor cost
Total cost = $320 + $150
Total cost = $470

The final answer is: $470"
"Let's say the number of chickens is C and the number of cows is 20 - C (since there are 20 animals in total).

Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. We know that the total number of legs is 70. 

We can write an equation to represent this situation: 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70

Simplifying the equation, we get: 2C + 80 - 4C = 70

Combine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10

Divide both sides by -2: C = 5

So, there are 5 chickens on the farm."
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, let's find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. 

Total slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. There are 4 people in total (Henry and his 3 friends).

Slices per person = Total slices / Number of people = 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person

The final answer is: 14"
