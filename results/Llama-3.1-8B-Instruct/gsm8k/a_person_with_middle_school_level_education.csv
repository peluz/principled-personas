"Let's break it down step by step:

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. 
She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.
She bakes 4 eggs for muffins, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.
She sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 each, so she makes 9 x $2 = $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find out how many bolts of white fiber it takes, we need to find half of 2 bolts of blue fiber. Half of 2 is 1. 

So, it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber. 

To find the total number of bolts, we add 2 and 1. 

2 + 1 = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we need to first find the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The house was originally $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

To find 150% of $80,000, we multiply $80,000 by 1.5 (since 100% + 50% = 150%). 

$80,000 x 1.5 = $120,000

So the total value of the house after the repairs is $120,000. 

The total amount Josh spent on the house and repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

To find the profit, we subtract the total amount spent from the total value of the house after the repairs.

Profit = Total value after repairs - Total amount spent
Profit = $120,000 - $130,000
Profit = -$10,000

Josh actually lost $10,000."
"To find out how many meters James runs in a week, we need to first find out how many meters he runs in one week of sprints. 

James runs 3 sprints a day, and he does this 3 times a week. So, he runs a total of 3 * 3 = 9 sprints in a week.

Since each sprint is 60 meters, we multiply the number of sprints by the distance of each sprint: 9 * 60 = 540 meters.

So, James runs 540 meters in a week."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to first find out how many cups of feed she gives to all her chickens in total. 

In the morning, she gives 15 cups of feed to her chickens. In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed. So, the total cups of feed she gives in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi gives 3 cups of feed to each chicken, and she has 20 chickens, the total cups of feed she needs to give to all her chickens in a day is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, we know that Wendi already gave 40 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon. So, to find out how many cups of feed she needs to give in the final meal, we need to subtract the cups of feed she already gave from the total cups of feed she needs to give. 

60 - 40 = 20 cups.

So, Wendi needs to give 20 cups of feed to her chickens in the final meal of the day.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much Kylar needs to pay, we need to calculate the total cost of the glasses. 

First, let's find out how many glasses are full price and how many are discounted. Since every second glass is discounted, we can divide the total number of glasses by 2. 

16 glasses / 2 = 8 full price glasses and 8 discounted glasses.

The cost of 8 full price glasses is 8 x $5 = $40.

The cost of 8 discounted glasses is 8 x 60% of $5. To find 60% of $5, we multiply $5 by 0.6. 

$5 x 0.6 = $3.

So, the cost of 8 discounted glasses is 8 x $3 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the full price glasses and the discounted glasses to find the total cost.

$40 + $24 = $64.

So, Kylar needs to pay $64 for the glasses.

The final answer is: $64"
"Let's break it down step by step.

Seattle has 20 sheep. 
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 x 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together: 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to find the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, add the time it takes to install the updates, and then add the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, let's find the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 x 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, it will take her 80 / 2 = 40 minutes to download the first 40% of the file.

Next, we need to add the time it takes to install the updates, which is 20 minutes.

Now, we need to find the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. 60% of 200 GB is 0.6 x 200 = 120 GB. It will take Carla 120 / 2 = 60 minutes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to find the total distance he traveled in those 4 hours.

First, let's find the distance he traveled on the way to the point where he turned around. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 mph * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

Now, let's find the distance he traveled on the way back home. 

He spent the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he didn't travel any distance in those 2 hours. 
He then drove for half an hour at 30 mph. 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 mph * 0.5 hours
Distance = 15 miles

He then drove for the remaining 2 hours at 80 mph. 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 160 miles

Now, let's add up the distances he traveled on both ways. 
Total distance = 180 miles + 15 miles + 160 miles
Total distance = 355 miles

Since he turned around, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is the same as the distance he traveled on the way to the point where he turned around. 
Distance from home = 180 miles"
"To find Eliza's earnings for this week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours. Her overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, so it's $10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour. Her overtime earnings are 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

Her total earnings for the week are $400 + $60 = $460.

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them up.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it's 3 x 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add up the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to multiply the number of each item by its price and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the donuts: 3 dozen donuts * $68 per dozen = 3 * 68 = $204

Next, let's find the cost of the mini cupcakes: 2 dozen mini cupcakes * $80 per dozen = 2 * 80 = $160

Then, let's find the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen mini cheesecakes * $55 per dozen = 6 * 55 = $330

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

The total cost is $694."
"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total income from the lemons each year.

The total cost of the tree is $90. 

Each year, the tree will grow 7 lemons, and each lemon will be sold for $1.5. So, the total income from the lemons each year is 7 x $1.5 = $10.5.

It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. So, the total cost each year is $3.

To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money, we need to find out when the total income will be more than the total cost.

Let's calculate the total income and cost for each year:

"Let's break this down step by step.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. If we call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with ""x"", then she sold x/3 at the green house.

She had x - x/3 = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house.

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, she had 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Next, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of 2x/3 - 2 is (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/3 - 1.

So, she had 2x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 1) = x/3 - 1 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house.

We know that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5.

To solve for x, we add 1 to both sides: x/3 = 6.

Then, we multiply both sides by 3: x = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find out how many students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance. 
20% of 20 = 0.2 x 20 = 4 students.

Now, 25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance. 
The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.
25% of 16 students = 0.25 x 16 = 4 students.

Now, we know that 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance and 4 students enrolled in jazz dance. 
So, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100.
(12 / 20) x 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the increase in value of each item. 

For the jewelry, the increase in value is 2.5% of $5,000. 
2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125

For the electronic gadgets, the increase in value is 1.2% of $8,000. 
1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96

The profit from the jewelry is $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
The profit from the electronic gadgets is $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

The merchant should choose the electronic gadgets because it has a higher profit. 
The profit would be $8,096."

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate how much she earns from teaching and coaching separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate how much Jill earns from teaching:

She works 35 hours a week as a teacher and gets paid $20 per hour. 
So, her weekly earnings from teaching are 35 hours * $20/hour = $700 per week.

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are $700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000 per year.

Next, let's calculate how much Jill earns from coaching:

She works 15 hours a week as a coach and gets paid $30 per hour. 
So, her weekly earnings from coaching are 15 hours * $30/hour = $450 per week.

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are $450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500 per year.

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:

$35,000 (teaching) + $22,500 (coaching) = $57,500

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to know how many days are in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks have 4 x 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. To find out how many eggs she eats in 28 days, we multiply 3 eggs per day by 28 days: 3 x 28 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks: 84 ÷ 12 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we need to first find the total time she has to walk the remaining distance. 

She has already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and 2 miles in another hour, so she has walked 6 miles in 2 hours. 

The total distance is 12 miles, and she has already walked 6 miles, so she has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left to walk.

If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12 miles, and she has 2 hours to walk the remaining 6 miles, we can use the formula: 

Time = Distance / Speed

We know the time (2 hours) and the distance (6 miles), so we can rearrange the formula to find the speed: 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 2 hours
Speed = 3 miles per hour

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 3 miles per hour.

"To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we need to multiply 10 liters by 2/3. 

10 liters * 2/3 = 20/3 liters of water in the orange drink.

To find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, we need to multiply 15 liters by 3/5.

15 liters * 3/5 = 45/5 liters of water in the pineapple drink.

Now, we need to add the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink, then subtract the amount of water spilled.

First, let's convert the fractions to decimals to make it easier to calculate.

20/3 = 6.67 liters of water in the orange drink.
45/5 = 9 liters of water in the pineapple drink.

Now, let's add the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink.

6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters of water.

Now, let's subtract the amount of water spilled.

15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters of water.

The total amount of liquid is 24 liters, so we need to find the fraction of water in the total liquid.

The amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 14.67 liters.

To find the fraction of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to divide the amount of water by the total amount of liquid.

14.67 / 24 = 0.61 or 61%.

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 61%."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Samantha is 31 years old now.
2. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old now.
3. Raymond had a son at the age of 23, so the son is 25 - 23 = 2 years younger than Raymond.
4. Since Raymond is 25 now, his son is 25 - 2 = 23 years old now.
5. We want to know how many years ago Raymond's son was born. Since his son is 23 now, we need to subtract 23 from the current year to find the year he was born.
6. However, we don't know the current year, but we can find the difference in age between Samantha and Raymond's son. Samantha is 31 and Raymond's son is 23, so the difference is 31 - 23 = 8 years.
7. Since Raymond was 23 when his son was born, and now he is 25, the difference in age between Raymond and his son is 25 - 23 = 2 years.
8. The difference in age between Samantha and Raymond's son is 8 years, and the difference in age between Raymond and his son is 2 years. This means that 8 - 2 = 6 years have passed since Raymond's son was born.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to add up the number of DVDs each group of customers bought.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought 3 x 1 = 3 DVDs.

The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.

The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so they bought 0 DVDs.

Now, we add up the number of DVDs bought by each group: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 DVDs.

So, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find out how many centimeters shorter the candle will be, we need to know how many hours it burns. 

The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. That's 4 hours. 

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply 4 hours by 2 centimeters. 

4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the original price of the book, we need to figure out what 100% of the price is, since 25% is the discount. 

If 25% is the discount, that means 75% of the original price is $19.50. 

To find 100%, we can divide $19.50 by 75% (or 0.75). 

$19.50 ÷ 0.75 = $26.00

The original price of the book was $26.00.

$26.00"
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12. 
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 x $3 = $15. 
The cost of 4 apples is 4 x $1.50 = $6. 

Now, let's add the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples together: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. 

Since Marie paid a total of $50, we need to subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount she paid to find out how much she spent on pizza. 

$50 - $33 = $17. 

Now, we need to divide the amount she spent on pizza ($17) by the cost of each box of pizza ($8.50) to find out how many boxes she ordered. 

$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2. 

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Mishka spent, we need to add up the cost of all the items. 

First, let's find the total cost of the shorts: 3 pairs of shorts * $16.50 = $49.50

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to find out how many cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream per night, and there are 60 days. So, she eats 1 * 60 = 60 servings of ice cream.

Each carton has 15 servings, so to find out how many cartons she buys, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton: 60 / 15 = 4 cartons.

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton: 4 * $4.00 = $16.00.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to know the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. 

The total distance of the trip is 60 miles. If he stopped 15 miles before the end of the trip, that means he traveled 60 - 15 = 45 miles after his first stop. 

So, the distance between his first and second stops is the distance he traveled after his first stop, which is 45 miles."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

We know that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, so the other pair costs 33 * 2 = $66.

The two pairs of heels together cost $33 + $66 = $99.

We also know that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, the boots cost $99 + $5 = $104.

The final answer is: $104"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Since Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11, we can represent their ages as 7x and 11x, where x is a number.

Their total age now is 162, so we can write an equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages: Darrell's age is 7x = 7(9) = 63, and Allen's age is 11x = 11(9) = 99.

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109.

The final answer is: 109"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The first friend says 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend says 20 more than half of 80, which is (80 / 2) + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60.
3. The third friend says 25% more than 80, which is 80 + (80 x 0.25) = 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of guesses: 240 / 3 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find out how many hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the number of hours each dog takes to care for.

Number of dogs: 10
Hours per dog: 0.5

Multiply the number of dogs by the hours per dog: 
10 * 0.5 = 5

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the total hours per day by 7 to get the total hours per week:
5 * 7 = 35

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of dogs.

35"
"Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

So, the number of silver coins is 40. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Half of Raymond's jewels is 40 / 2 = 20. So, Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.
3. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to find out how many points he scored in the second 20 minutes. 

First, we know he scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes. 

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. 25% of 4 is 1. So, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points in the second 20 minutes.

Now, we add the points from both 20 minutes to get the total points. 
4 (first 20 minutes) + 5 (second 20 minutes) = 9 points.

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first find out how much he spends on yogurt per day. 

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. They are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00. To find the cost of 1 yogurt, we need to divide $5.00 by 4 yogurts. 

$5.00 ÷ 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Now that we know the cost of 1 yogurt, we can multiply it by 2 (since Terry eats 2 yogurts a day) to find the daily cost.

$1.25 per yogurt * 2 yogurts = $2.50 per day

Now, we multiply the daily cost by 30 days to find the total cost.

$2.50 per day * 30 days = $75.00

"To find out how much money John made from selling his lego sets, we need to multiply the number of lego sets by the price of each set. 

13 lego sets * $15 each = $195

Now, we know John bought 8 video games for $20 each, so we need to multiply the number of video games by the price of each game.

8 video games * $20 each = $160

John had $5 left after buying the video games, so we need to subtract the cost of the video games from the total money he made.

$195 - $160 = $35

This means John spent $35 on other things, but we don't know what those things are. However, we do know that he had $5 left. 

Since John had $5 left, we can assume that he spent the rest of the money on the video games. 

To find out how many lego sets he sold, we need to divide the total money he made by the price of each lego set.

$35 / $15 = 2.33

Since John can't sell a fraction of a lego set, we round down to 2 lego sets. 

However, we know that John had 13 lego sets initially, so we need to subtract the number of lego sets he sold from the initial number of lego sets.

13 - 2 = 11

John still has 11 lego sets."
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to find out how many miles he runs per hour. 

First, let's find out how many miles he runs in a day. He runs 3 hours the first day, and half as much on the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. So, he runs 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours in total per week. 

Since he runs 60 miles a week, we can divide 60 miles by 6 hours to find out his speed. 

60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break this down step by step.

Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour. Since she can skip at a rate that is half as fast as she can run, she can run at 3 x 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana can run at 6 miles per hour and walk at 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour (since she can run four times faster than she can walk).

She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, if she spends 6 hours in total, she spends 6 x 1/3 = 2 hours running and 6 x 2/3 = 4 hours walking.

Now, let's calculate the distance she travels while running and walking:

Distance running = speed x time = 6 miles/hour x 2 hours = 12 miles
Distance walking = speed x time = 1.5 miles/hour x 4 hours = 6 miles

Total distance = distance running + distance walking = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles

Distance without gemstone = 400 feet
Distance with gemstone = 400 * 3 = 1200 feet

Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1000 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the javelin. But we need to find out how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames she can stand. 

Distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames = Distance with gemstone - Distance of dragon's flames

"To find out how many calories you can still eat, we need to subtract the calories you've already consumed from your daily target. 

2000 (daily target) - 1800 (already consumed) = 200 calories left

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we need to find out how many servings you can eat with 200 calories.

200 (calories left) / 250 (calories per serving) = 0.8 servings

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we need to find out how many grams are in one serving.

300g (total) / 5 (servings) = 60g per serving

Now, we multiply the number of servings we can eat by the grams per serving.

0.8 (servings) * 60g (per serving) = 48g

The cost of supplies for 20 candles is the cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks, because 20 candles is 2 pounds of beeswax. 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks cost $10.00. 

The total revenue is the price of 20 candles, which is 20 x $2.00 = $40.00.

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. So, the net profit is $40.00 - $10.00 = $30.00.

"To find out the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to find out how many articles she wrote each day and multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 2/5 of 5 is 2. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. 2 times 7 is 14. So, she wrote 14 articles on Wednesday.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Candice started with 80 post-it notes. She used some post-it notes at work, and she had 23 post-it notes left. So, the total number of post-it notes she used is 80 - 23 = 57.

She used 57 post-it notes at work, and she placed a single post-it note on each of 220 cups of coffee. So, the number of post-it notes she used at work is equal to the number of cups of coffee. 

Now, we know that the total number of post-it notes she used is 57, and the number of post-it notes she used at work is 220. So, the number of post-it notes she bought is 220 - 57 = 163.

"Let's break this down step by step.

John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find out how many blue ties he bought, we can divide the total amount he spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie.

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 times the number of blue ties in red ties.

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. This means the cost of each red tie is 1.5 times the cost of each blue tie.

Cost of each red tie = 1.5 * Cost of each blue tie
= 1.5 * $40
= $60

Now, let's find the total amount John spent on red ties.

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

To find the total amount John spent on ties, we add the amount he spent on blue ties and the amount he spent on red ties.

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds from the comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds from the toys.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find the number of toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

7.5 pounds / 0.5 pounds/toy = 15 toys

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."

Now, we subtract the total number of unripe and bad oranges from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges. 

25 - 6 = 19 oranges.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find out how much Janet paid, we need to add the cost of the material and the cost of the jeweler, then add 10% of that total to get the insurance cost.

First, we add the cost of the material and the jeweler: 
$500 (material) + $800 (jeweler) = $1300

Then, we find 10% of $1300:
10% of $1300 = 0.1 x $1300 = $130

Now, we add the insurance cost to the total:
$1300 (material and jeweler) + $130 (insurance) = $1430

So, Janet paid $1430."
"To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 30 years and then add 5% of that value.

Marcy works for 30 years, but she only gets the 5% increase after 20 years. So, for the first 20 years, she gets $50,000/year. 

For the next 10 years (30 - 20 = 10), she gets 5% of the value of the pension. 

First, we need to find the total value of the pension after 20 years. Since she gets $50,000/year for 20 years, the total value is $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000.

Now, we need to find 5% of $1,000,000. 5% is the same as 0.05. So, 0.05 * $1,000,000 = $50,000.

Now, we add $50,000 to the $50,000 she gets for the first 20 years. $50,000 + $50,000 = $100,000.

So, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $100,000."
"To find the total amount Aleena paid, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately and then add them together.

The first half of the year is 6 months, so the amount she paid for the first half is 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, she paid 10% less than the initial amount. To find 10% of $140, we multiply $140 by 0.1, which is $14. So, 10% less than $140 is $140 - $14 = $126.

The amount she paid for the second half of the year is 6 * $126 = $756.

Now, we add the amount she paid for the first half and the second half to find the total amount she paid: $840 + $756 = $1596.

The final answer is: $1596"
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to know how many miles she can drive per gallon. 

We know that she used 4 gallons of gas to travel 100 miles. To find out the miles per gallon, we can divide the miles by the gallons: 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon.

Now that we know the miles per gallon, we can multiply it by the total gallons her tank holds: 25 miles per gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find out how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading, we need to first find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in one week. 

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV. 
He then reads for half as long, which is 2 / 2 = 1 hour. 
So, in total, he spends 2 + 1 = 3 hours on TV and reading in one day. 

Since he does this 3 times a week, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours on TV and reading in one week. 

To find out how many hours he spends in 4 weeks, we multiply 9 hours by 4. 
9 * 4 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of people, we need to find the total number of students and the total number of coaches.

Each school has 2 teams (girls and boys) and each team has 5 players. So, each school has 2 x 5 = 10 players.

There are 4 schools, so the total number of players is 10 x 4 = 40.

Each school also has 2 coaches (1 for girls and 1 for boys), so the total number of coaches is 2 x 4 = 8.

The total number of people is 40 (players) + 8 (coaches) = 48.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. There were 175 diamonds.
2. There were 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, so the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.
3. There were twice the number of emeralds as rubies, so the number of emeralds is 2 x 140 = 280.
4. To find the total number of gems, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds: 175 + 140 + 280 = 595.

The final answer is: 595"
"If there are twice as many boys as girls, that means there are 2 times 60 boys. 2 x 60 = 120 boys. 

There are 60 girls and 120 boys, so the total number of students is 60 + 120 = 180 students. 

Since there are 5 students to every teacher, we need to divide the total number of students by 5 to find the number of teachers. 180 / 5 = 36. 

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. To find out how much money she got from her allowance, we need to multiply the weekly allowance by the number of weeks.

Weekly allowance: $5
Number of weeks: 8
Total allowance: $5 x 8 = $40

Bailey has a total of $100 at the end of 8 weeks. This includes the money she started with and the money she got from her allowance. To find out how much money she started with, we need to subtract the total allowance from the total amount of money she has.

Total money: $100
Total allowance: $40
Initial money: $100 - $40 = $60

So, Bailey started with $60. 

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much money Judy makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week and multiply it by the number of students in each class and the price per student.

Judy teaches 5 classes a day for 5 days (Monday to Friday), so that's 5 x 5 = 25 classes. 
She also teaches 8 classes on Saturday, so that's 25 + 8 = 33 classes in total.

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students is 33 x 15 = 495 students.

Judy charges $15 per student, so the total amount of money she makes is 495 x $15 = $7,425.

The final answer is: $7,425"
"To find the total number of instructions, we need to add the number of instructions in the first recipe to the number of instructions in the second recipe.

The first recipe has 20 instructions. 
The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so it has 2 x 20 = 40 instructions.

Now, we add the number of instructions in both recipes: 20 + 40 = 60.

Next, let's calculate the money from selling cheesecakes: 
23 cheesecakes * $4 per cheesecake = 23 * 4 = $92

Now, let's add the money from brownies and cheesecakes together: 
$129 + $92 = $221

The final answer is: $221"
"To find out how much Shiela will pay each month, we need to first calculate the total cost of the cell phones with the interest. 

The cost of 5 cell phones is $150 each, so the total cost is 5 x $150 = $750.

A 2% interest will be charged for each unit, so the interest for 5 units is 5 x 2% = 10%.

To find 10% of $750, we multiply $750 by 0.1 (since 10% = 10/100 = 0.1). 
$750 x 0.1 = $75.

So, the total cost with interest is $750 + $75 = $825.

Since Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months, we need to divide the total cost by 3 to find out how much she will pay each month.
$825 / 3 = $275.

The final answer is: $275"

"To find the average square footage of a level, we need to find the total square footage of all levels and then divide it by the number of levels.

The top level has a square footage of 16. 
The second level will have half the square footage of the top level, so it's 16 / 2 = 8. 
The third level will have half the square footage of the second level, so it's 8 / 2 = 4. 
The fourth level will have half the square footage of the third level, so it's 4 / 2 = 2.

Now, let's add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

There are 4 levels in total. To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5.

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. So, the total amount of dog food eaten in the first 180 days is 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.

The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the total amount of dog food eaten in the rest of the year is 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food eaten in the first year is 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. David does 1/4 of what Sarah does, since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. 
   So, David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, which is 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.
4. To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we need to subtract the amount David does from the amount Raymond does.
   So, the difference is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

"To find the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 and packages of 2.

If Vincent buys 18 flowers in packages of 3, he will need 6 packages (18 / 3 = 6). The cost will be 6 x $2.50 = $15.

If Vincent buys 18 flowers in packages of 2, he will need 9 packages (18 / 2 = 9). The cost will be 9 x $1 = $9.

The better price is $9. To find the savings, we subtract the cost of the better price from the cost of the more expensive option: $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"

First, we multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 * 25 = 75

Then, we multiply the result by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600

So, there are 600 thorns in total."
"Let's say the number of games they lost is x. 

Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the number of games they won plus the number of games they lost is equal to 22. 

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2: 
x = 7

So they lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, they won 7 + 8 = 15 games.

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to first find her salary after 5 years of service and then increase it by 10% for 3 more years.

Sylvie's initial salary is $600. After 5 years, her salary will be increased by 10% of $600 for 5 years. 

10% of $600 is $60. 

So, her salary after 5 years will be $600 + ($60 * 5) = $600 + $300 = $900.

Now, we need to increase her salary by 10% for 3 more years. 

10% of $900 is $90. 

So, her salary after 3 more years will be $900 + ($90 * 3) = $900 + $270 = $1170.

Her annual salary after three more years of service is $1170."
"Let's say Harald sold x copies. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies. 

The total number of copies they sold is 88,000, so we can write an equation: x + 10x = 88,000. 

Combine like terms: 11x = 88,000. 

Divide both sides by 11: x = 8,000.

So Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we need to first find out how many guests will show up. Since 1/4 of the guests don't show up, 3/4 of the guests will show up. 

To find 3/4 of 16, we multiply 16 by 3 and divide by 4. 

16 * 3 = 48
48 / 4 = 12

So, 12 guests will show up. Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply 12 by 0.75.

12 * 0.75 = 9

Now, we know Christina needs 9 gift bags. Each gift bag costs $2. To find the total cost, we multiply 9 by 2.

9 * 2 = 18

So, Christina will spend $18."

Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, Gerald used to run 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so we need to find 10% of 40 seconds and add it to 40 seconds. 

10% of 40 is 0.1 x 40 = 4 seconds. 

So Gerald's new time is 40 + 4 = 44 seconds.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that there are 60 dogs. Since there are 2 cats for every dog, we can find the number of cats by multiplying the number of dogs by 2.

Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

We are also told that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. To find the combined number of dogs and cats, we add the number of dogs and cats together.

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Now, we need to find the number of rabbits. We know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats.

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12

"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that the 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. 

When Freda cooks the tomatoes, they lose half their volume. This means that the 16 ounce can will become 8 ounces of sauce. 

Since the 16 ounce can becomes 8 ounces of sauce, we can say that 1 can of tomatoes makes 8 ounces of sauce. 

We know that Freda made 32 ounces of sauce. To find out how many cans of tomatoes she used, we can divide 32 by 8. 

32 ÷ 8 = 4 

This means that Freda used 4 cans of tomatoes. 

Since each can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes, we can multiply 4 by 3 to find out how many tomatoes Freda used. 

4 x 3 = 12 

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes."

Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we multiply the length, width, and height to get the inner volume of one box:
3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
24 cubic inches * 3 = 72 cubic inches

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Monday and Tuesday: 2 nights * 1 hour = 2 hours
- Wednesday: We don't know how many episodes, but each episode is 30 minutes, so let's call the number of episodes x. Then, the total time watched on Wednesday is 30x minutes.
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes) = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 * 1 hour = 2 hours

Total time watched is 2 + 30x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 hours. 

Now, let's convert everything to the same unit (hours) and solve for x:
2 + 30x + 1.5 + 2 = 7
Combine like terms:
5.5 + 30x = 7
Subtract 5.5 from both sides:
30x = 1.5
Divide both sides by 30:
x = 0.05

Since x is the number of 30-minute episodes, we need to convert it to a whole number because you can't watch a fraction of an episode. However, in this case, x is already a fraction, and we are looking for the number of episodes, so we can multiply x by 2 to get the total minutes and then divide by 30 to get the number of episodes. But since we are looking for the number of episodes, we can just multiply x by 2 and then divide by 30, but we can also just multiply x by 2 and then divide by 30, but we can also just multiply x by 2

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to bake twice as many, so he bakes 2x cookies.

However, he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the total number of cookies he actually baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much the gas will cost after the cashback rewards, we need to first find out how much the gas costs before the rewards. 

The gas costs $3.00 per gallon, and the person is buying 10 gallons. 

So, the total cost of the gas is 3 * 10 = 30 dollars.

The app company is offering a cashback of $0.20 per gallon. 

So, the total cashback is 0.20 * 10 = 2 dollars.

Now, we need to subtract the cashback from the total cost of the gas to find out how much it will cost after the rewards.

So, the final cost is 30 - 2 = 28 dollars.

The final answer is: $28"
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups each person ate, we need to multiply the width by the length. 

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 roll-ups long = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 roll-ups long = 42 roll-ups

Now, we need to find the total number of roll-ups they ate. 
Total roll-ups = Beatrice's roll-ups + Marcell's roll-ups = 48 + 42 = 90

To find the average, we need to divide the total number of roll-ups by 2 (since there are 2 people). 
Average roll-ups = Total roll-ups / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to know how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed. 

Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find out how many seconds it takes her to row 10 feet. 

20 feet / 2 = 10 feet (since she rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds, we divide 20 by 2 to get 10 feet)

10 feet takes 16 / 2 = 8 seconds. 

Now we know that 10 feet takes 8 seconds. 

The shore is 64 seconds away, and it takes 8 seconds to row 10 feet. 

64 / 8 = 8 (since 64 seconds is how long it takes to get to the shore, and 8 seconds is how long it takes to row 10 feet, we divide 64 by 8 to get 8)

So, Julia rowed 8 sets of 10 feet. 

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, and Julia rowed 8 sets of 10 feet, the boat took on 8 * 2 = 16 liters of water. 

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to know how many lessons are taught in a day and how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in each lesson.

Each teacher has 2 lessons per day, and there are 4 teachers. So, the total number of lessons per day is 4 teachers * 2 lessons = 8 lessons.

The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson. So, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 lessons * 3 times per lesson = 24 times.

"To find out how many flowers Ryan has, we need to know how many flowers he planted and subtract the ones that didn't grow. 

Ryan plants 2 flowers a day. He did this for 15 days. 

2 flowers/day * 15 days = 30 flowers

But 5 flowers didn't grow. 

30 flowers - 5 flowers = 25 flowers

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold by dividing 1800 by 6.

Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's call the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph ""x"". Then, we can write the equation:

300 = 50x

To find the value of x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 50.

x = 300 / 50
x = 6

So, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the profit, we need to first find the total cost of the lumber and the total selling price.

The total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100.
The total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80.
The total cost of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of each 2 x 4 x 10 board is $10 + ($10 * 0.5) = $15.
The new price of each 4 x 4 x 10 board is $16 + ($16 * 0.5) = $24.

The total selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $15 = $150.
The total selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $24 = $120.
The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to find the total parts in the ratio and then find the fraction of the total that is sugar.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so the total parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20.

Since Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water, we can set up a proportion to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar:

(7/20) = x/120

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

7 * 120 = 20x
840 = 20x

Now, we can divide both sides by 20 to find x:

x = 840 / 20
x = 42

So, Katy used 42 teaspoonfuls of sugar.

"To find out how much John paid, we need to multiply the number of pairs of shoes by the cost of each pair, and then multiply that by the number of children.

First, we multiply the number of pairs of shoes by the cost of each pair: 2 pairs * $60 = $120

Then, we multiply the result by the number of children: $120 * 3 = $360

So, John paid $360."
"Let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles was 2 x 5 = 10.

The next day, more containers were brought in, and the total number of vehicles became 30. To find out how many more vehicles were added, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers that were imported on the second day by dividing the number of additional vehicles by 5: 20 / 5 = 4.

So, 4 containers were imported on the second day.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. This means that if Adrien's salary is A, then Lylah's salary is A / 1.3 (since 100% + 30% = 130%, or 1.3).

We also know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000. Since his salary increased by 40% four years later, his new salary is 40000 * 1.4 (since 100% + 40% = 140%, or 1.4).

So, Adrien's new salary is 40000 * 1.4 = 56000.

Now, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the equation:

A / 1.3 = Lylah's salary

We know that A = 40000, so we can plug this in:

40000 / 1.3 = Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = 30769.23

Now, we need to find Lylah's new salary. Since her salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), her new salary is 30769.23 * 1.4 = 43136.72.

Now, we can find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later:

Adrien's new salary: 56000
Lylah's new salary: 43136.72
Total salary: 56000 + 43136.72 = 99136.72

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week. Since there are 30 sheets of paper in a pad, he uses 2 x 30 = 60 sheets of paper a week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, Miguel uses 60 x 4 = 240 sheets of paper a month.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 x 5 = 10 apples.

Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, let's count the total number of fruits they have. Morisette has 5 + 8 = 13 fruits. Kael has 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

In total, they have 13 + 14 = 27 fruits.

"Let's break it down step by step.

Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. 

For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

So, for Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept 6 hours each day. 

The total hours she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday is 6 + 6 = 12 hours.

The rest of the week is from Thursday to Sunday, which is 5 days. She slept 1 hour more than the 6 hours she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

The total hours she slept from Thursday to Sunday is 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

Now, let's add up the total hours she slept throughout the week: 
8 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday and Wednesday) + 28 (Thursday to Sunday) = 48 hours.

First, she runs 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. 
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, she runs 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours (7 - 3 = 4). 
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, we add the distances of both parts to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours.
Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total Distance = 50 miles

Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. 

To find one-third of 60, we need to divide 60 by 3. 

60 ÷ 3 = 20

So, Jennie put stamps on 20 letters. 

Now, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that the 20 letters Jennie put stamps on are now in the pile of already-stamped letters. 

To find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to subtract 20 from 30. 

30 - 20 = 10

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons, but we don't know how many yet.
2. Her husband bought 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
4. After using the spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons.

We know that the total number of spoons Julia had after using 3 spoons is 12. So, before using the 3 spoons, she had 12 + 3 = 15 spoons.

We also know that her husband gave her 5 spoons. So, before her husband gave her the spoons, she had 15 - 5 = 10 spoons.

Now, we know that Julia had 10 spoons before her husband gave her the spoons. This means that the package she bought had 10 spoons.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of sausages, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages. 

Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 
He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages: 38 + 44 = 82

The final answer is: 82"
"Amy made 20 more friends than Lily. Lily made 50 friends. So, Amy made 50 + 20 = 70 friends. 

To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we need to add the number of friends they each have. 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120. 

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's break this down step by step.

1. First, we need to find the cost of a watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, a watermelon costs 3 x $15 = $45.

2. Next, we need to find the cost of an orange. Since an orange costs 5 dollars less than what a watermelon costs, an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.

3. Now, we can find the total cost of the watermelons. Dillon is buying 4 watermelons, and each watermelon costs $45, so the total cost of the watermelons is 4 x $45 = $180.

4. Next, we can find the total cost of the peppers. Dillon is buying 20 peppers, and each pepper costs $15, so the total cost of the peppers is 20 x $15 = $300.

5. Finally, we can find the total cost of the oranges. Dillon is buying 10 oranges, and each orange costs $40, so the total cost of the oranges is 10 x $40 = $400.

6. To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we add the cost of the watermelons, peppers, and oranges together: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To find the profit, we need to find out how much the hospital pays the doctors and how much they get from the patients. 

First, let's find out how many hours the doctors work in a day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide 24 minutes by 60 to get the fraction of an hour. 

24 minutes / 60 minutes = 0.4 hours

Since each patient is seen for 0.4 hours, we can multiply this by the number of patients to get the total hours worked by the doctors.

500 patients * 0.4 hours = 200 hours

The doctors charge $150 an hour, so we multiply the total hours worked by the hourly rate to get the total amount the hospital pays the doctors.

200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

Now, let's find out how much the hospital gets from the patients. We know the patients are seen for 0.4 hours, and the hospital charges $200 an hour. 

200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

To find the profit, we subtract the amount the hospital pays the doctors from the amount they get from the patients.

$40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000

The hospital makes $10,000 profit from these visits."
"To find out how many elves quit after kids vomit on them, we need to find a third of 60. A third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20. 

So, 20 elves quit after kids vomit on them. Now, we have 60 - 20 = 40 elves left.

Then, 10 more elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, we subtract 10 from 40. 40 - 10 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total expenditure, we need to add the expenditure of Joseph in May and June.

In May, Joseph's expenditure was $500.
In June, his expenditure was $60 less than May, so it's $500 - $60 = $440.

Now, let's add the expenditure of May and June: $500 + $440 = $940.

The final answer is: $940"
"To find out how many tickets they used, we need to find out how many rides they did in total and multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she rode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

In total, they rode 4 + 6 = 10 rides.

Each ride costs 6 tickets, so they used 10 x 6 = 60 tickets.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break it down step by step.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.

On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. 
So, he walked 6 x 4 = 24 miles on Tuesday.

Now, we know that his total mileage from Monday to Wednesday was 41 miles. 
We already know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. 
So, the total miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage from Monday to Wednesday.
So, miles walked on Wednesday = Total mileage - miles walked on Monday and Tuesday
= 41 - 28
= 13

"To find out how much Tom pays in a year, we need to multiply the number of car washes he gets in a month by the cost of each car wash, and then multiply that by 12 (the number of months in a year).

First, we multiply the number of car washes by the cost of each car wash: 
4 car washes/month * $15/car wash = $60/month

Then, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
$60/month * 12 months/year = $720/year

The final answer is: $720"
"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we need to first find out how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian has 20 video games, but he lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. To find out how many video games Bobby has, we need to multiply the number of video games Brian has by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 times 15 is 45, and 5 fewer than that is 45 - 5 = 40.

So, Bobby has 40 video games.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we need to find one third of 27. 

One third of 27 is 27 / 3 = 9. 

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. 

Now, we need to find out how many of these unicorns are female. Two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. 

Two thirds of 9 is 9 * 2 / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6.

So, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns. 

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total cost, we need to add up the cost of the subs, chips, and cookies. 

2 subs for $7.50 each will be 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
2 bags of chips for $1.50 each will be 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
2 cookies for $1.00 each will be 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

Now, we add up the cost of the subs, chips, and cookies: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

There's a 20% delivery fee added at checkout. To find 20% of $20.00, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20: $20.00 x 0.20 = $4.00

Now, we add the delivery fee to the total cost: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Rory also wants to add a $5.00 tip. To find the final cost, we add the tip to the total cost: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

The final answer is: $29.00"
"To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to find out how many questions he completed in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

First, we need to find out how many questions Mark can complete in 8 hours. 
5 questions per hour * 8 hours = 40 questions

Since Mark can complete 40 questions in 8 hours, and the test has 75 questions, he will leave 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.

5 questions per hour * 6 hours = 30 questions

Since Mark can complete 30 questions in 6 hours, and the test has 100 questions, he will leave 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete.

Now, we need to add the number of questions Mark left incomplete in both tests to find the total number of questions he left incomplete.

35 questions (from the first test) + 70 questions (from the second test) = 105 questions

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know there are 12 blue gumballs. 

The problem says there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. 

So, we need to find four times the number of blue gumballs. Four times 12 is 4 x 12 = 48.

Now, we need to add 22 to 48. 48 + 22 = 70.

So, there are 70 pink gumballs.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to know how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 are automatic, and 4 are manual. 

First, let's find out how many semi-automatic cars there are. We can do this by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now that we know there are 4 semi-automatic cars, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars. 

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say the number of baby bees is x. 
Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2x. 
Since there are twice as many babies as queens, the number of queens is x/2. 
The total number of bees is 700, so we can write an equation: x + 2x + x/2 = 700. 

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2: 2x + 4x + x = 1400. 
Now we can combine like terms: 7x = 1400. 
To solve for x, we divide both sides by 7: x = 200. 

Now that we know the number of baby bees is 200, we can find the number of worker bees. The number of worker bees is 2x, so the number of worker bees is 2 * 200 = 400.

The final answer is: 400"
"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week, we need to first find out how many hours he would work in a week. Since he plays video games for 2 hours a day, if he worked those 2 hours instead, he would work 2 hours a day.

There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply 2 hours by 7 days to get the total hours he would work in a week: 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours/week.

Now, we know Jordan earns $10 an hour. To find out how much he would earn in a week, we multiply the total hours he would work by his hourly wage: 14 hours/week * $10/hour = $140/week.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find the total cost, we need to add up the cost of all the items. 

First, let's add up the cost of the non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
Total non-food items: 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate 10% of 10 dollars:
10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 x 10 = 1 dollar

Now, let's add the tax to the total cost of non-food items:
10 dollars + 1 dollar = 11 dollars

Now, let's add up the cost of the food items:
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
Total food items: 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Now, let's add the cost of the food items and the non-food items:
5 dollars + 11 dollars = 16 dollars

"To find the total income, we need to know how many clients Kim has. He already has 3 clients and is talking to 5 more, so he will have 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. So, for 8 clients, he will need 8 * 2 = 16 bottles of bleach and 8 * 1 = 8 packs of cloths.

Bottles of bleach cost $2 each, so 16 bottles will cost 16 * 2 = $32. Packs of cloths cost $5 each, so 8 packs will cost 8 * 5 = $40.

Total expenses will be the cost of bleach plus the cost of cloths, which is 32 + 40 = $72.

His total income is $92. To find the profit, we need to subtract the total expenses from the total income. So, profit will be 92 - 72 = $20.

1. 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. Then, 1/2 that many bees return in the next 6 hours. 
   1/2 of 30 is 15, so 15 bees return in the next 6 hours.
3. Now, 2 times as many bees as the first 30 leave the hive in the next 6 hours. 
   2 times 30 is 60, so 60 bees leave the hive in the next 6 hours.
4. Now, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours. 
   30 bees left in the first 6 hours, and 15 returned in the next 6 hours. 
   So, 30 - 15 = 15 bees hadn't returned yet. 
   These 15 bees return to the hive in the next 6 hours.

So, the number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 15."

So, the total cost of the tickets is $12 + $10 = $22.

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, that means she gave the cashier the total cost of the tickets plus the change she received. 

Let's call the amount she gave the cashier ""x"". 

x - $22 = $8 (since she received $8 in change)

To find the amount she gave the cashier, we need to add the change to the total cost of the tickets. 

x = $22 + $8
x = $30

So, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."

"To find out who will win the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home.

Steve's distance is 3 miles, which is 5280 feet (since 1 mile = 5280 feet). His speed is 440 feet per minute. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 5280 / 440
Time = 12 minutes

Tim's distance is 2 miles, which is 10560 feet (since 1 mile = 5280 feet). His speed is 264 feet per minute.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 10560 / 264
Time = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 12 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will win the race. 

To find out how long the winner will wait for the loser, we need to subtract the time it takes for the winner to get home from the time it takes for the loser to get home.

Time the winner waits = Time it takes for the loser to get home - Time it takes for the winner to get home
Time the winner waits = 40 - 12
Time the winner waits = 28 minutes

"To find out how much money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires. 

First, let's find out how many tires were inflated in total. 
- 5 people on bicycles have 2 tires each, so that's 5 x 2 = 10 tires.
- 3 people on tricycles have 3 tires each, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 tires.
- 1 person on a unicycle has 1 tire, so that's 1 x 1 = 1 tire.
- Total tires inflated = 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, we need to multiply the total number of tires by the cost per tire. 
- Total cost = 20 x 25 cents = 20 x 0.25 = 5 dollars.

So, Shawnda made $5 that day."
"To find out how much Carl pays for the cookies, we need to multiply the number of packs of cookies by the number of cookies in each pack, and then multiply that by the cost of each cookie.

Number of packs of cookies: 10
Number of cookies in each pack: 6
Cost of each cookie: $0.10

First, we multiply the number of packs of cookies by the number of cookies in each pack: 
10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Then, we multiply the total number of cookies by the cost of each cookie:
60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so we need to find out how much change he receives. To do that, we subtract the cost of the cookies from the $10 bill:
$10 - $6 = $4

So, Carl receives $4 in change."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total eaten is 14 (Dave) + 7 (seagull) = 21 french fries.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.
   Now, the total eaten is 21 (Dave and seagull) + 9 (pigeons) = 30 french fries.
4. A raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's call the total number of fries in the pack x. 
   The raccoon ate 2/3 * x fries, and 1/3 of the fries remained.
   We know that after the raccoon, 5 fries remained. So, 1/3 * x = 5.
   To find x, we multiply both sides by 3: x = 5 * 3 = 15.
5. Now we know that the total number of fries in the pack was 15. But we need to add the fries eaten by Dave, seagull, pigeons, and raccoon to find the original number of fries.
   The total eaten is 30 (Dave, seagull, and pigeons) + 2/3 * 15 (raccoon) = 30 + 10 = 40.
   Since 40 fries were eaten, the original number of fries in the pack is 40 + 5 (remaining) = 45.

"To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours he spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and the total hours he spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays, then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long. So, he spends 3 hours each day on these days. Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, and there are 3 days in a week when he has 3 classes, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours on these days each week. 

In 16 weeks, he spends 9 * 16 = 144 hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long. So, he spends 4 hours each day on these days. Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, and there are 2 days in a week when he has 4 hours of classes, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours on these days each week.

In 16 weeks, he spends 8 * 16 = 128 hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

To find the total hours Kimo spends attending classes, we add the hours he spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays to the hours he spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays: 144 + 128 = 272.

"To find the total length, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good in feet and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 2 feet is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 inches.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches:
- Rolls: 300 rolls x 4 inches per roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants x 6 inches per croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes x 24 inches per baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the total length of all the baked goods in inches: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches): 3360 / 12 = 280 feet

The gorillas need 400 bananas every month, so for 2 months, they need 400 x 2 = 800 bananas.

The baboons need 100 bananas every month, so for 2 months, they need 100 x 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, we add up the total number of bananas the apes need for 2 months: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

So, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate how far each person ran. 

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, he covers the whole field each time. So, he runs 100 yards each time. To find the total distance, we multiply 100 yards by 15. 

100 yards * 15 = 1500 yards

Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards each time. She does this 34 times. To find the total distance, we multiply 80 yards by 34.

80 yards * 34 = 2720 yards

Since 2720 yards is more than 1500 yards, Kelly is the winner.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract the distance Blake ran from the distance Kelly ran.

2720 yards - 1500 yards = 1220 yards

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.

Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin.

Anakin caught 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.

"To find the total cost of all the toys, we need to find the cost of each toy and add them up.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 x $5 = $15.

One red car costs $4. There are 5 red cars, so the total cost of the red cars is 5 x $4 = $20.

There are 3 action figures, and each costs $5, so the total cost of the action figures is 3 x $5 = $15.

Now, we add up the cost of all the toys: $15 (doll) + $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) = $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the money she'll lose by doing the taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's find out how much money Jackie will lose by doing the taxes herself. She'll lose 3 hours of freelance work, and she earns $35/hour. 

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the money she'll lose by doing the taxes herself.

$105 - $90 = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to subtract the total cost of the computer accessories from her budget.

The total cost of the computer accessories is:
€1090 (computer) + €157 (scanner) + €74 (CD burner) + €102 (printer) = €1323

Now, we subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget:
€1500 (budget) - €1323 (total cost) = €177

So, Elvira will have €177 left for her clothing."
"To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to know how many eggs she needs in total to make 15 Spanish flans. 

Since each Spanish flan needs 3 eggs, we multiply 3 eggs by 15 flans: 
3 eggs/flan * 15 flans = 45 eggs

Now, we need to find out how many times Sandra has to babysit to get 45 eggs. Since she gets 9 eggs each time she babysits, we divide 45 eggs by 9 eggs:
45 eggs / 9 eggs = 5

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say Brooke's age is B. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age is 2B.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be B + 2 and Seth's age will be 2B + 2.

The sum of their ages in 2 years will be (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 3B + 4.

We know that the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can set up the equation 3B + 4 = 28.

To solve for B, we need to subtract 4 from both sides of the equation: 3B = 24.

Then, we divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age is 2B = 2(8) = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to first find out how much money is twice the amount Ethel has. 

Twice the amount Ethel has is 2 x 8 = 16.

16 + 2 = 18.

So, Jimmy has $18."
"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the miles he walks in a week. 

There are 7 days in a week. Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, he walks 20 * 5 = 100 miles from Monday to Friday. 

On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, he walks 10 * 2 = 20 miles on the weekends.

Now, we add the miles he walks from Monday to Friday and the miles he walks on the weekends. 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost of each uniform, we need to find the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants, and then add them together.

The hat costs $25.

The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 x $25 = $75.

The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"To find the total number of legs, we need to multiply the number of spiders by the number of legs each spider has, the number of insects by the number of legs each insect has, and the number of mutant invertebrates by the number of legs each mutant invertebrate has. 

First, let's calculate the total number of legs from the spiders: 80 spiders * 8 legs = 640 legs.

Next, let's calculate the total number of legs from the insects: 90 insects * 6 legs = 540 legs.

Lastly, let's calculate the total number of legs from the mutant invertebrates: 3 mutant invertebrates * 10 legs = 30 legs.

Now, we add up the total number of legs from each group: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.

The final answer is: 1210"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 x 8 = 16 years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of the four birds:
8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirtytwo) = 51

"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to first find out how much she pays each month. 

Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300, but she wants to pay 50% more than that. 50% of $300 is $150. So, she will pay $300 + $150 = $450 for her student loans each month.

Her credit card's minimum is $200, and she wants to pay 50% more than that. 50% of $200 is $100. So, she will pay $200 + $100 = $300 for her credit card each month.

Her mortgage's minimum is $500, and she wants to pay 50% more than that. 50% of $500 is $250. So, she will pay $500 + $250 = $750 for her mortgage each month.

Now, we need to add up how much she pays each month. $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500. 

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12. $1500 * 12 = $18,000.

"To find out how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to add up the time it takes to peel and cut each potato. 

First, let's find out how long it takes to peel one potato. It takes 1.5 minutes to peel a potato. 

Now, let's find out how long it takes to cut one potato. It takes 5 seconds to cut a potato. We need to convert this to minutes because we're adding it to the peeling time. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 5 seconds is 5/60 = 1/12 of a minute. 

Now, let's add the peeling and cutting time together. 1.5 minutes (peeling) + 1/12 minute (cutting) = 1.5 + 0.0833 = 1.5833 minutes. 

Since it takes 1.5833 minutes to peel and cut one potato, we need to multiply this by the total number of potatoes. 1.5833 * 60 = 95. 

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so they make $0.50 x 20 = $10 per gallon.
2. They make a profit of $25, so their total income from selling lemonade is $25 + the cost of lemons and sugar.
3. Let's say they made x gallons of lemonade. Then, their total income is $10x.
4. The cost of lemons and sugar is $3 + $2 = $5 per gallon.
5. So, the total cost of lemons and sugar is $5x.
6. Their total income is equal to their total cost plus their profit: $10x = $5x + $25.
7. Subtracting $5x from both sides gives us $5x = $25.
8. Dividing both sides by 5 gives us x = 5.
9. Since x is the number of gallons they made, and they spent $3 per gallon on lemons, they spent 5 x $3 = $15 on lemons.

Total people = 240
Japanese people = 80
Chinese people = Total people - Japanese people
Chinese people = 240 - 80
Chinese people = 160

Now, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we need to subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese people.

Number of girls = Total Chinese people - Number of boys
Number of girls = 160 - 60
Number of girls = 100

1. Zaid earns 6000$ per month.
2. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent: 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$
3. He spends 1/3 on car fuel: 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$
4. Total spent so far: 1500 + 2000 = 3500$
5. He donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity: 1/2 * (6000 - 3500) = 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$
6. Total spent so far: 3500 + 1250 = 4750$
7. He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$: 200 + 700 = 900$

Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's call the number of white carnations ""x"". Then the number of red roses is 4x.

She also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. This means the number of white carnations is 200 / 5 = 40.

Now we know the number of white carnations is 40. Since the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations, the number of red roses is 4 * 40 = 160.

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm.

"Let's break it down step by step.

Since Jan is 30 years old, two years ago Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Half of Jan's age two years ago is 28 / 2 = 14. 

So, two years ago Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Now, we need to find Mark's current age. Since two years have passed, Mark's current age is 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time for the well-rounded team, we multiply the time of each runner by 4 since there are 4 runners. 

Well-rounded team's total time = 55 seconds * 4 = 220 seconds

For the less well-rounded team, the first runner runs 60 seconds, the second runner runs 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, the third runner runs 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth runner runs 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. 

Less well-rounded team's total time = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds

To find the difference in time, we subtract the less well-rounded team's time from the well-rounded team's time.

Difference in time = 220 - 162 = 58 seconds

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To find out how much more likely it is that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probability of each event and then find the difference between them.

First, let's find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die (4, 5, and 6). So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 or 1/2 or 50%.

Now, let's find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6). The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 or 1/2. The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6 or 1/2. Since these are independent events, we multiply the probabilities together to get the probability of both events happening: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities. The difference is 50% - 25% = 25%.

So, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"Let's break down the information given:

- There are 3 cages of rats.
- Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
- There are 10 cages of hamsters.
- Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
- 20 pieces of straw are given to the rabbits.
- Total straw distributed among small rodents is 160.

First, we need to find out how many pieces of straw are given to the hamsters and rabbits. 

Since 20 pieces of straw are given to the rabbits, and the total straw distributed among small rodents is 160, we can subtract 20 from 160 to find out how many pieces of straw are given to the hamsters.

160 - 20 = 140

Now, we know that 140 pieces of straw are given to the hamsters. Since there are 10 cages of hamsters and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw, we can find the total number of hamsters by dividing 140 by 5.

140 / 5 = 28

So, there are 28 hamsters. 

Now, we know that 160 - 140 = 20 pieces of straw are given to the rats. Since there are 3 cages of rats and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, we can find the total number of rats by dividing 20 by 6.

20 / 6 = 3.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. However, 3.33 is closer to 3.33 than 3, and since there are 3 cages of rats, we can assume that 3.33 is the total number of rats in all 3 cages. 

To find the number of rats in each cage, we can divide 3.33 by 3.

3.33 / 3 = 1.11

Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. However, 1.11 is closer to 1.11 than 1, and since there are 3 cages of rats, we can assume that 1.11 is the number of rats in each cage."
"To find out how much Mandy should give to Benedict, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months. 

The monthly interest is 2% of $100. To find 2% of $100, we multiply $100 by 0.02 (since 2% is the same as 2/100 or 0.02). 

$100 x 0.02 = $2

Since the interest is 2% per month, we need to multiply this by 3 months. 

$2 x 3 = $6

Now, we add the interest to the original amount Mandy owes. 

$100 + $6 = $106

So, Mandy should give $106 to Benedict."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The trader buys the bags at $20 each and sells them at $30 each, so the profit per bag is $30 - $20 = $10.

2. The trader made a total profit of $400, so the number of bags sold can be found by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag: $400 / $10 = 40.

3. However, we also need to consider the cost of transportation. The cost of transportation per bag is $2, so the total cost of transportation is 2x, where x is the number of bags sold.

4. The total cost of buying the bags is 20x, where x is the number of bags sold.

5. The total revenue from selling the bags is 30x, where x is the number of bags sold.

6. The total profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is 30x - (20x + 2x) = 30x - 22x = 8x.

7. We know that the total profit is $400, so 8x = 400.

8. To find the number of bags sold, we divide both sides by 8: x = 400 / 8 = 50.

So, the trader sold 50 bags."
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to find the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. So, the cost of the food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they split the cost evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

3.5 pounds/duck/week * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week

Then, we divide the total pounds of insects per week by 7:
35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

"Let's break it down step by step:

Tom starts with 50 trees.

He plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year. So, the net change in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees.

After 10 years, the total change in trees will be 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

So, the total number of trees after 10 years will be 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

But, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find 30% of 130, we multiply 130 by 0.3.

0.3 * 130 = 39

So, 39 trees die. 

Now, we subtract 39 from the total number of trees after 10 years to find the final number of trees.

130 - 39 = 91

On Saturday, the neighbors took one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, there are now 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos, so now there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

To find out how many white flamingos there are, we already know there are 6 white flamingos.

Now, to find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos, we need to subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to know how many crayons she can buy with $20. Since one crayon costs $2, we can divide $20 by $2 to find out how many crayons she can buy.

$20 ÷ $2 = 10 crayons

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color. 

Now, let's find out how much she will spend. 
2 crayons * 5 colors = 10 crayons

She will spend $2 * 10 = $20

Since she spent all her money, she will get no change. 

The final answer is: $0"
"To find the cost of 8 pens, we first need to find the cost of one pen. 

A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined, we add the cost of a pencil and an eraser to find the cost of a pen.

Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now that we know the cost of one pen, we can find the cost of 8 pens by multiplying the cost of one pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of one pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to first find out how many pounds of carrots will be used. 

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

So, the total pounds of carrots used will be 2 * 40 = 80 pounds.

Now, we need to subtract the pounds of carrots used from the total pounds of carrots. 

200 - 80 = 120 pounds.

So, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the number of kids in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

First, let's add the number of men and women:
8417 + 9092 = 17509

Now, let's subtract the sum from the total population:
23786 - 17509 = 6277

So, there are 6277 kids in Soda."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times that number, so she collected 3 x 20 = 60 cards.
   Now she has 20 + 60 = 80 cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, so she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
   Now she has 80 + 40 = 120 cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months.
   The combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months is 60 + 40 = 100.
   So, she collected 2 x 100 = 200 cards in the third month.
   Now she has 120 + 200 = 320 cards.

The final answer is: 320"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Mark edits 1000 sentences each week.
2. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence.
3. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.
4. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so Mark makes 500 * 5 = 2500 cents from Publisher A.
5. Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence.
6. Mark edits 500 sentences for Publisher B, so he makes 500 * 10 = 5000 cents from Publisher B.
7. To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the amount he makes from both publishers: 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

The final answer is: 7500"
"To find out how many liters of water Baldur gets every day, we need to find out how many pails of water he gets in a day and then multiply it by the number of liters in each pail.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Each pail contains 5 liters of water. So, the total number of liters of water he gets in a day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

The final answer is: 55"
"To find out how much John made that year, we need to calculate his new salary after the 5% raise and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

First, let's find the 5% raise. 5% of 2000 is 0.05 x 2000 = 100. 

So, his new salary is 2000 + 100 = 2100 per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year. 

Now, let's multiply his new salary by the number of weeks in a year: 2100 x 52 = 109200.

Now, let's add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his total salary: 109200 + 5000 = 114200.

The final answer is: 114200"
"To find out how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many tons of grapes her farm produces per year. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year and she has 10 acres, we multiply 5 tons by 10 acres.

5 tons/acre * 10 acres = 50 tons

2. Now, we need to find out how many barrels of wine each ton of grapes makes. We know that each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine.

3. To find out how many barrels of wine her farm produces per year, we multiply the total tons of grapes by the number of barrels each ton makes.

50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the total number of slices he used for sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni and cheese.

For sandwiches, he ate 7 sandwiches (one for each day of the week) and used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. So, he used 7 x 2 = 14 slices of cheese for sandwiches.

For omelets, he ate 3 omelets (one for each of the 3 days he had omelets) and used 3 slices of cheese per omelet (one more slice than the 2 slices per sandwich). So, he used 3 x 3 = 9 slices of cheese for omelets.

For macaroni and cheese, he used 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the total number of slices of cheese he used: 14 (for sandwiches) + 9 (for omelets) + 8 (for macaroni and cheese) = 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find out how many pens Janet has now, we need to add the number of pens she already had to the number of pens she bought.

Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she had 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, and each bag had 9 pens, so she bought 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens, and each bag had 6 pens, so she bought 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, let's add all the pens together: 32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98 pens.

Janet now has 98 pens."
"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we need to first find the total score she needs for the six tests. 

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score each semester, we need to find the lowest score among the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

We will remove this score from the total score. 

The total score of the first five tests is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338.

Now, we will remove the lowest score (71) from the total score. 
338 - 71 = 267.

Since Brinley wants an average of 93, we need to find the total score for six tests. 
The average is calculated by dividing the total score by the number of tests. 
So, the total score for six tests is 93 * 6 = 558.

Now, we need to find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test. 
We already have a total score of 267 from the first five tests. 
So, the score Brinley needs on the sixth test is 558 - 267 = 291.

The final answer is: 291"
"To find the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike, we need to calculate the total kilometers he rode in the first four weeks and the total kilometers he rode in the next three weeks.

In the first four weeks, he rode 5 times a week for 25 kilometers each time. So, the total kilometers he rode in the first four weeks is:
5 times/week * 25 kilometers/time * 4 weeks = 500 kilometers

In the next three weeks, he rode 2 times a week for 60 kilometers each time. So, the total kilometers he rode in the next three weeks is:
2 times/week * 60 kilometers/time * 3 weeks = 360 kilometers

Now, we add the total kilometers he rode in the first four weeks and the next three weeks:
500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers

"To find the total weight of the chocolate bars, we need to multiply the number of chocolate bars by the weight of each chocolate bar. 

Number of chocolate bars: 25
Weight of each chocolate bar: 40g
Total weight of chocolate bars: 25 * 40g = 1000g

To find the total weight of the candied apples, we need to multiply the number of candied apples by the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is half the weight of each chocolate bar.

Weight of each chocolate bar: 40g
Weight of each candied apple: 40g / 2 = 20g
Number of candied apples: 80
Total weight of candied apples: 80 * 20g = 1600g

To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples.

Total weight of chocolate bars: 1000g

"Let's break it down step by step.

On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, so she bought 3 x 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, so she bought 5 x 12 = 60 cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought after all three days, we need to add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

The final answer is: 76"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that half a dozen plates cost $6000. Since a dozen is 12, half a dozen is 6. So, 6 plates cost $6000. 

To find the cost of one plate, we divide $6000 by 6. 

$6000 / 6 = $1000 per plate.

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. We already know that half a dozen plates cost $6000. 

So, twenty dozen cups cost $6000 - $1200 = $4800.

To find the cost of one cup, we divide $4800 by 24 (since twenty dozen is 24). 

$4800 / 24 = $200 per cup.

"To find out how much money Sara needs, we need to add the cost of the jacket and the shoes. 

Cost of the jacket: $30
Cost of 2 pairs of shoes: 2 x $20 = $40
Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn. 

Let's find out how much more money she needs: $70 - $10 = $60

Now, let's find out how much money she earns from babysitting: $5 x 4 = $20

She still needs $60 - $20 = $40. 

Now, let's find out how much she earns from mowing the lawn: $4 x number of times she mows the lawn = $40

To find the number of times she needs to mow the lawn, we need to divide $40 by $4: $40 / $4 = 10

"Let's say the number of red chickens is x. Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is x + 2.

Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs from red chickens is 3x.

White chickens produce 5 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs from white chickens is 5(x + 2).

Jerry collects 42 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs from both red and white chickens is 3x + 5(x + 2) = 42.

Combine like terms: 3x + 5x + 10 = 42

Combine like terms again: 8x + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides: 8x = 32

Divide both sides by 8: x = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens."
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to find the total distance he walks and then divide it by his speed.

The park is a rectangle, so we need to find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up the lengths of all its sides. 

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5
Perimeter = 15 miles

Since Gary walks around the edge of the park, he walks the entire perimeter. 

Now, we need to divide the perimeter by his speed to find the time he spends walking.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, in 4 minutes, each pool lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

So, the small pool now has x - 16 gallons of water, and the big pool now has 2x - 16 gallons of water.

We are told that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. We can write an equation based on this information:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Add 16 to both sides:

2x = 4x - 48

Subtract 4x from both sides:

-2x = -48

Divide both sides by -2:

x = 24

So, the small pool had 24 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Now, the small pool has 24 - 16 = 8 gallons of water.

"Let's break it down step by step.

We know Harriet is 21 years old now. 

Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 times Harriet's age. 
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet. 
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years old.

Now, let's find their ages in three years. 
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3 = 45 years old.
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3 = 66 years old.

To find the average age, we need to add their ages and divide by 3. 
Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45.

10 more than 34 is 34 + 10 = 44. 
So Yuri scored 44 points. 

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. 
17 more than 68 is 68 + 17 = 85. 
So Brianna scored 85 points. 

The total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197.

Another one-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12. So, 12 penguins went inside the cave.

Now, we need to find out how many penguins are left sunbathing. We started with 36 penguins. 12 jumped in the ocean and 12 went inside the cave. So, 12 + 12 = 24 penguins left the sunbathing area. 

36 - 24 = 12

"To find out how many vines Steve needs, we need to know how many tomatoes he eats in a week. 

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. There are 7 days in a week, so he eats 6 x 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve. So, his girlfriend eats 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

In total, they eat 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes per week.

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines Steve needs, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes each vine produces per week. 

63 / 3 = 21 vines."
"To find out how many pizzas John needs, we need to find out how many slices he needs in total and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

There are 20 friends and each needs 4 slices, so we multiply 20 by 4 to get the total number of slices needed: 20 x 4 = 80 slices.

Since each pizza has 8 slices, we need to divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza: 80 / 8 = 10.

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Ram buys 25 pens. 
He uses 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. 
So, for every 5 empty pens, he gets 1 new pen. 
To find out how many new pens he can make from 25 pens, we need to divide 25 by 5. 
25 / 5 = 5 
So, he can make 5 new pens from the 25 pens. 
Now, he has 25 - 5 = 20 empty pens left. 
He can use these 20 empty pens to make 20 / 5 = 4 new pens. 
Now, he has 20 - 4 = 16 empty pens left. 
He can use these 16 empty pens to make 16 / 5 = 3.2 new pens. 
Since we can't make a fraction of a pen, we round down to 3 new pens.

"To find out how much money Johnny had after a year, we need to follow the steps he took.

1. Johnny started with $20.
2. He added $10 to it, so now he has $20 + $10 = $30.
3. He invested this sum of money, which tripled in a year. This means he now has 3 times the amount he had before, so we multiply $30 by 3.

$30 * 3 = $90

So, Johnny had $90 after a year."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Jessa is 20 years old. 
Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old. 
Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old. 

Now, we need to find the sum of their ages. 
Sum of their ages = Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age 
= 20 + 25 + 23

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find 30% of 1000 students who went out through exit A.
   30% of 1000 = 0.3 x 1000 = 300 students

2. Now, we subtract the students who went out through exit A from the total number of students.
   Remaining students = 1000 - 300 = 700

3. Then, we find 3/5 of the remaining students who went out through exit B.
   3/5 of 700 = (3/5) x 700 = 420 students

4. Now, we subtract the students who went out through exit B from the remaining students to find the number of students who went out through exit C.
   Students who went out through exit C = 700 - 420 = 280

The final answer is: 280"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

We know John has 54 candies. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can find out how many candies Robert has by dividing John's candies by 2. 

Robert's candies = John's candies / 2
Robert's candies = 54 / 2
Robert's candies = 27

We also know James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we can find out how many candies James has by adding 6 to Robert's candies.

James' candies = Robert's candies + 6
James' candies = 27 + 6
James' candies = 33

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. We can do this by subtracting James' candies from John's candies.

Difference = John's candies - James' candies
Difference = 54 - 33
Difference = 21

The final answer is: 21"

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then convert that to hours.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike gets from his 3 remaining penpals. Since each of them sends 2 letters a week, that's 2 * 3 = 6 letters a week.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, Mike gets 6 * 5 = 30 pages a week from his penpals.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages a week.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, he writes 60 pages in 60 * 6 = 360 minutes a week.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so Mike writes for 360 / 60 = 6 hours a week."
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to first find out how many minutes he used for his boss's calls. 

Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day and there are 30 days in the month, we multiply 15 minutes by 30 days. 

15 * 30 = 450 minutes

Now, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for other people. 

450 + 300 = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in the plan. 

1000 - 750 = 250 minutes

So, Jason has 250 minutes left.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Griffin had 24 french fries initially. 

Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin. Now Griffin has 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 x 5 = 10 fries. Now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin some fries, and then Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took. Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. 

After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had 9 - 2 = 7 fries. But we know that in the end Griffin had 27 fries. So, Ginger must have given Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's say the number of fish in each aquarium is x. 

Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

This difference is also twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2 again:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how much Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours she worked, the total cost before the discount, and then apply the discount.

1. Total hours worked: 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours
2. Total cost before discount: 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000
3. Discount amount: 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000
4. Total cost after discount: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to know the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight of the onions is 4 x 50 = 200 pounds.

Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, we multiply the total weight by the cost per pound: 200 x $1.50 = $300.

The chef spent $300."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate 2 x 13 = 26 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies Sue ate, we add the cookies she ate on Monday and Tuesday: 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies her sister ate, we add the cookies she ate on Monday and Tuesday: 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Now, we need to find the total calories Sue and her sister consumed. Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we multiply the total number of cookies each of them ate by 200.

Sue's total calories: 46 x 200 = 9200 calories
Her sister's total calories: 18 x 200 = 3600 calories

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract her sister's calories from Sue's calories: 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

The final answer is: 5600"
"Let's break this down step by step.

We know that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls. This means that the total number of boys and girls in the school is equal.

Since there are 3 classes, and each class has 20 students, the total number of students in the school is 3 x 20 = 60.

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 x 60 = 30.

We know that the total number of girls in the first two classes is 27, so the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% girls, the number of boys in the school is also 30. We know that the first two classes have a total of 20 + 20 = 40 students. The number of boys in the first two classes is 40 - 27 = 13.

So, the number of boys in the third class is 30 - 13 = 17.

"Let's break down the information given. 

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's say the number of cougars he killed today is x. Then, the number of wolves he killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars he killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars he killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12 to find the number of wolves he killed today. 

3x = 12
x = 12 / 3
x = 4

So, the number of wolves he killed today is 3x = 3 * 4 = 12.

Now, let's find the total number of animals Rick killed. 

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. So, the total number of animals he killed last night is 10 + 15 = 25.

Today, Rick killed 12 wolves and 12 cougars. So, the total number of animals he killed today is 12 + 12 = 24.

The total number of animals Rick killed is 25 + 24 = 49.

The final answer is: 49"
"To find out which floor Bill is on, we need to calculate 4 times his starting floor (3) plus 6.

So, Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we need to find 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 x 30 = 9. 

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, so Robert went down the slide 4 x 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"First, we need to find out how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. He bought 40 cows and put them into 10 stalls. 

40 cows / 10 stalls = 4 cows per stall

Now, we know that each stall already had 20 cows. So, the total number of cows in each stall is 20 + 4 = 24 cows.

We need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. 

24 cows per stall * 8 stalls = 192 cows

The final answer is: 192"
"To find out how much money Brady has, we need to calculate the total amount in cents and then convert it to dollars.

First, let's calculate the total amount in cents:

- 100 pennies = 100 cents
- 40 nickels = 40 x 5 = 200 cents
- 20 dimes = 20 x 10 = 200 cents
- 40 dollar bills = 40 x 100 = 4000 cents (but we need to convert this to dollars first)

Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we can convert 4000 cents to dollars by dividing by 100:
4000 / 100 = 40 dollars

Now, let's add up the total amount in cents:
100 + 200 + 200 = 500 cents

Now, we need to convert the total amount in cents to dollars:
500 / 100 = 5 dollars

Now, let's add the dollar bills to the total amount:
5 + 40 = 45 dollars

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to find out how many 10-foot sections it has. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how much the termites ate. The termites ate 30% of the wood, so we multiply the total weight by 0.3 (which is 30%): 8000 * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

To find the weight of the redwood after the termites ate, we subtract the weight the termites ate from the total weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find out how much Nancy has to pay, we need to add the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee.

First, let's find the total cost of the overdue books: 
8 books * $0.50 per book = 8 * 0.50 = $4.00

Then, we add the flat fee: 
$4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

So, Nancy has to pay a total of $6.00."
"Let's break this down step by step.

Andrea has 52 apples. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

To find the total number of fruits, we need to add the number of apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have. 

Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so she has 52 + 24 = 76 fruits.

Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so he has 44 + 48 = 92 fruits.

The total number of fruits is 76 + 92 = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to know how many cookies she's making in total and how many cups of flour are needed for each cookie.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. So, she's making a total of 36 + 30 = 66 cookies.

We know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies. A dozen is 12 cookies. So, to make 12 cookies, we need 2 cups of flour. To make 66 cookies, we need to know how many sets of 12 cookies are in 66. 

66 divided by 12 is 5.5. This means we have 5 sets of 12 cookies and 6 extra cookies. For 5 sets of 12 cookies, we need 5 x 2 = 10 cups of flour. For the 6 extra cookies, we need 6/12 x 2 = 1 cup of flour.

So, in total, Carla needs 10 + 1 = 11 cups of flour.

"To find two thirds of the pennies, we need to multiply 9,300 by 2/3. 

First, we multiply 9,300 by 2, which is 18,600. 

Then, we divide 18,600 by 3 to find two thirds of the pennies. 

18,600 / 3 = 6,200.

Since each penny is worth 1 cent, or 0.01 dollars, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = 62

The final answer is: $62"
"Maddison has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box. To find out how many marbles she has in total, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box.

5 boxes * 50 marbles/box = 250 marbles

Then, Maddison gets 20 marbles from her friend. To find out how many marbles she has now, we need to add the marbles she got from her friend to the marbles she already had.

250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles

So, Maddison now has 270 marbles."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Chris has 6 trees.
2. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.
3. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. First, we find twice the number of trees Ferdinand has: 2 x 3 = 6. Then, we add 5 to that: 6 + 5 = 11.

Now, we need to find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard. We subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has: 11 - 3 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"

"To find the total price of the house, we need to add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 5% of $350,000. To find 5% of $350,000, we multiply $350,000 by 0.05.

$350,000 x 0.05 = $17,500

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 12% of $350,000. To find 12% of $350,000, we multiply $350,000 by 0.12.

$350,000 x 0.12 = $42,000

Now, we add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price to find the total price of the house.

$350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500

The total price of the house is $409,500. To find how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price.

$409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we need to first calculate the transfer fees and brokerage fees. 

Transfer fees are 3% of the selling price, which is 3% of $400,000. 
3% of $400,000 = 0.03 x $400,000 = $12,000

Brokerage fees are 5% of the selling price, which is 5% of $400,000. 
5% of $400,000 = 0.05 x $400,000 = $20,000

Now, we need to add the transfer fees and brokerage fees to find the total amount Mr. Tan paid. 
$12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000

Now, we need to subtract the total fees and the remaining loan amount from the selling price to find Mr. Tan's net proceeds. 
$400,000 - $32,000 - $250,000 = $118,000

The final answer is: $118,000"
"To find the time it takes to heat up to 400 degrees, we need to find 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 x 20 = 8 minutes. 
So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time is 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees, 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees, and 23 minutes to cook. 
20 + 28 + 23 = 71 minutes.

"To find the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

Each house has 3 bedrooms with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is 3 x 2 = 6.

There are 4 additional windows in each house.

So, the total number of windows in one house is 6 (from bedrooms) + 4 (additional) = 10.

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first find out how many stitches the collar and rosette take. 

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know that the total number of stitches in the sweater is 1800. We already know that the body takes 900 stitches and the collar and rosette take 90 and 180 stitches respectively. 

So, the total number of stitches taken by the collar and rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Now, we subtract the total number of stitches taken by the collar and rosette from the total number of stitches in the sweater to find out how many stitches the body and sleeves take together: 1800 - 270 = 1530 stitches.

Since the body takes 900 stitches, the sleeves take 1530 - 900 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches taken by the sleeves by 2 to find out how many stitches each sleeve takes: 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to find out how many lines are in the first scene, the second scene, and the solo song, and then add them up.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song, so it has 2 x 54 = 108 lines. But only a third of them are Sean's lines, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the solo song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of them are Sean's lines, so he has 4/5 x 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we add up the lines from the first scene, the second scene, and the solo song: 36 + 48 + 54 = 138.

In 9 years, Sam's age will be x + 9 and Ruby's age will be 6x + 9.

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, we can write the equation: 6x + 9 = 3(x + 9)

Now, let's solve the equation: 
6x + 9 = 3x + 27
6x - 3x = 27 - 9
3x = 18
x = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra. So, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

Now, we know there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas. To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots on each cobra: 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

To find the total number of spots on the mambas, we multiply the number of mambas by the number of spots on each mamba: 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

Now, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

12 team members + 3 coaches = 15 people
15 people * 2 guests = 30 guests
15 team members + 3 coaches = 18 team members and coaches
30 guests + 18 team members and coaches = 48 people

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need to divide the total number of people by 3 to find out how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy.

48 people / 3 people per pizza = 16 pizzas

Each pizza costs $15, so we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza to find out how much Maddy will spend.

"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to find out how much space the topaz gemstones take up and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace. 

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 of them, so they take up 8 inches. 

Now, we need to find out how much space the sterling silver beads take up. The necklace is 25 inches long, and the topaz gemstones take up 8 inches, so the space left for the sterling silver beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, so to find out how many beads fit in 17 inches, we need to divide 17 by 1/4. 

To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of 1/4 is 4. So, 17 divided by 1/4 is the same as 17 multiplied by 4.

17 * 4 = 68

So, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we need to find the time the car in the fast lane took to travel 480 miles. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed.

Time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours.

Now, we know that 4 adults will get 6 chocolate bars each. So, we multiply 4 adults by 6 chocolate bars to find out how many chocolate bars the adults will get.

4 adults * 6 chocolate bars = 24 chocolate bars

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. We subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults got from the total number of chocolate bars.

40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars each child will get. There are 8 children, and they will share the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally. We divide 16 chocolate bars by 8 children to find out how many each child will get.

"To find out how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find out how many hours she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. But she also pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 2.5 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we multiply 2.5 hours by 60 to get the total minutes.

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we divide the total minutes by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals.

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since Susan earns $5 for every 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her hourly wage.

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Mike has 21 points after 3 rounds.
2. Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
3. Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 x 21 = 42 points.
4. Now, let's add up the points of all three players: 21 (Mike) + 18 (Jim) + 42 (Tony) = 81 points.
5. In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
   - Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point: 21 + 1 = 22 points.
   - Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point.
   - Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point: 42 + 1 = 43 points.
6. Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the extra points: 22 (Mike) + 18 (Jim) + 43 (Tony) = 83 points.

The final answer is: 83"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The oldest son is 8 years old.
2. The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, so the youngest son is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.
3. The oldest son washes 8 oranges and the youngest son washes 4 oranges.
4. Total oranges washed = 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.
5. Will bought 15 oranges initially.
6. To find the number of oranges left unwashed, we subtract the total oranges washed from the total oranges bought: 15 - 12 = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break it down day by day.

Day 1: 
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Day 2: 
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add up the total number of activities done in the two days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Total count of activities: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

The final answer is: 370"
"To find out how many days a bag of rice will last, we need to know how much rice is consumed per day. 

There are 2 meals a day (lunch and dinner), and 5 people eat rice every meal. So, the total rice consumed per day is 5 people * 2 meals * 0.2 kg = 2 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount of rice consumed per day (2 kg). 

42 kg / 2 kg = 21 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many weeks a bag of rice will last by dividing the number of days by 7.

21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks

So, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam sold, we need to add up the crates he sold each day. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend. 
On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates. 
On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates. 
On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

So, the total number of crates he sold is 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65.

Since he was closed on Monday and Friday, he didn't sell any crates on those days. 
There are 7 days in a week, so he missed selling crates on 2 days. 
The total number of crates he should have sold in a week is 120.

To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we need to subtract the number of crates he sold from the target. 
So, 120 - 65 = 55.

The final answer is: 55"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Carmen starts with a bid of $200. The other 3 people each bid once, so the desk price will increase by $50 three times. 

After the first person bids, the price will be $200 + $50 = $250. 
After the second person bids, the price will be $250 + $50 = $300. 
After the third person bids, the price will be $300 + $50 = $350.

Now it's Carmen's turn again. She will bid $350 + $50 = $400. 

So, the desk costs Carmen $400. 

The final answer is: $400"
"To find out how much John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven, the total cost of driving, and then add the bonus.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven:
Distance to work = 30 miles
Distance back home = 30 miles
Total distance per day = 30 + 30 = 60 miles
Total days per year = 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 250 days/year
Total miles per year = 60 miles/day * 250 days/year = 15,000 miles/year

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving:
Cost per mile = $2
Total miles per year = 15,000 miles
Total cost per year = 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000/year

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus per year is:
Total bonus per year = $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year

Now, let's add the total cost of driving and the total bonus to find the total amount John pays a year for driving:
Total amount per year = Total cost per year + Total bonus per year
Total amount per year = $30,000/year + $1,800/year
Total amount per year = $31,800/year

The final answer is: $31,800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final answer is: 78"

"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to first find out how much she spent on food and snacks. She spent half of her $50 on food and snacks, so that's $50 / 2 = $25. 

Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides. So, the total amount she spent is $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, we need to subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she had. So, $50 - $35 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Elise sold 45 books this year. We also know that she sold twice as many books in the first year as she did in the current year. So, the number of books she sold in the first year is 2 * 45 = 90.

We also know that she has sold a total of 250 - 50 = 200 books in the first two years. We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the current year. So, the number of books she sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65.

We know that each book sells for $20. So, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = $1300.

The final answer is: $1300"
"To find out how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his job and his bonus.

Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week. So, he works 10 x 5 = 50 hours a week.

Since there are 4 weeks in April, Watson works a total of 50 x 4 = 200 hours in April.

Watson earns $10 per hour, so his total earnings from his job in April are 200 x $10 = $2000.

He also gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. Since the company performed well for the whole month, he gets a bonus for 4 weeks, which is 4 x $300 = $1200.

So, his total earnings in April are $2000 + $1200 = $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to find 20% of 20. 

First, we need to find 1% of 20. 1% is 1/100, so 1% of 20 is 20/100 = 0.2. 

Now, we multiply 0.2 by 20 to find 20% of 20. 0.2 * 20 = 4.

So, John lost to 4 people."
"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we need to first find out how many loaves are left after selling in the morning. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is 2/3 * 60 = 40 loaves. 

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. 

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after selling in the morning. 

60 - 40 = 20 loaves are left.

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. 

Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves. 

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, we need to divide 10 by 2. 

10 / 2 = 5 loaves are sold in the afternoon.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how much weight Sandy loses in a week, we need to divide the weight Joey loses in 4 weeks by 4. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. 
8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we need to multiply the number of weeks it takes Joey to lose the weight by 4.

4 weeks * 4 = 16 weeks.

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings for each item and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. 
The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22. 
So, the savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. 
The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2. 
So, the savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many extra arms Helena's serum will cause a person to grow. Since the person grows an extra arm every three days, we can divide 15 days by 3 to find out how many times the person will grow an extra arm. 

15 ÷ 3 = 5

So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

Next, we need to find out how many extra legs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow. Since the person grows an extra leg every five days, we can divide 15 days by 5 to find out how many times the person will grow an extra leg.

15 ÷ 5 = 3

So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

Now, we need to add the number of extra arms and legs to find the total number of new limbs. 

5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we need to first calculate how much he has spent so far and how much he has left.

1. Cost of 6 business suits: 6 x $100 = $600
2. Cost of 3 suitcases: 3 x $50 = $150
3. Cost of the flight ticket: The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. 
   The cost of a business suit is $100, so 5 times that is 5 x $100 = $500. 
   The cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the total cost of the items he has bought so far:
$600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so he has to spend less than that. Let's subtract the total cost of the items he has bought so far from the total amount he has:
$6000 - $1950 = $4050

Now, let's subtract the amount he wants to save from the amount he has left:
$4050 - $2000 = $2050

So, the amount he has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is $2050."
"To find out how many eggs the family will eat in a week, we need to first find out how many eggs they eat in a day. 

There are 5 people in the family. 3 people eat 3 eggs each day, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 eggs. The rest of the people, which is 5 - 3 = 2, eat 2 eggs each day. So, 2 x 2 = 4 eggs. 

In total, the family eats 9 + 4 = 13 eggs per day. 

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 13 eggs per day by 7 days. 13 x 7 = 91 eggs. 

The family will consume 91 eggs in a week."

1. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
2. Since Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old six years ago.
3. The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60000.
4. The population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, so the current population of Chile is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say the number of players on the defense is x. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is x/2.

The total number of players is 105, which is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. 

So, we can write the equation: x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying the whole equation by 2, which gives us: 2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms: 7x = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7: x = 30

The number of players on the defense is 30."
"To find out how many people are invited, we need to calculate the total number of people invited. 

Martha invited 2 families with 6 people, so that's 2 x 6 = 12 people. 
She also invited 3 families with 4 people, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 people. 
So, the total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24 people.

Now, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. 
1/4 of 8 is 8 / 4 = 2. So, 2 people had previous commitments and couldn't come.

The total number of people who couldn't come is 8 + 2 = 10 people.

Now, we need to subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited. 
So, 24 - 10 = 14 people show up for Martha's party.

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to find the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to find the volume of the pool first. The formula for volume is length x width x height. 

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost.

Cost per cubic foot = $0.1
Total cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot = 120 x 0.1 = $12

Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls is 3 x 30 = 90.

We also know there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so the number of nongendered children is 1/10 x 30 = 3.

To find the total number of children, we need to add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children together: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

"To find the number of electric poles, we need to use the given ratio. The ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires. 

Let's say the number of poles is x. Then, the number of wires is 3x. We are given that the total number of wires is 45. 

So, 3x = 45

To find x, we need to divide both sides by 3.

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find the total number of people at the party. We know there were 25 men and 15 women. 

Total number of people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Now, 1/4 of the total number of people left the party. To find 1/4 of 40, we multiply 40 by 1/4.

1/4 of 40 = 40 * 1/4 = 10 people left

So, 10 people left the party. We know 22 men stayed, so the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3 men.

Since 10 people left and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7 women.

Now, we know there were 15 women initially and 7 women left. To find the number of women who stayed, we subtract 7 from 15.

Number of women who stayed = 15 - 7 = 8 women

The pen costs $1."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. To find out how many pencils are in each box, we need to divide 26 by 3. 

26 / 3 = 8.67 (but we can't have a fraction of a pencil, so we'll round down to 8 pencils per box)

Now, we know that Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 x 8 = 24 pencils. And she also has 2 loose pencils, so she has a total of 24 + 2 = 26 pencils.

Meg has 46 pencils.

To find out how many boxes they need in total, we need to add the number of pencils Jam and Meg have, and then divide by the number of pencils per box (8).

Total pencils = 26 (Jam) + 46 (Meg) = 72 pencils

Now, let's divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

72 / 8 = 9

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To find out how many milliliters weaker the coffee is, we need to calculate the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the cream.

Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we need to find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool it by 65 degrees. 

Let's assume the initial temperature of the coffee is 100 degrees (for simplicity). We need to find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool it down to 35 degrees (100 - 65 = 35).

Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to find out how many ice cubes are needed: 65 / 13 = 5 ice cubes.

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Since 5 ice cubes are added, the coffee will be 5 x 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Now, we need to add the weakening effect of the cream. The cream makes the coffee 15 milliliters weaker.

So, the total weakening effect is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: 75"

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, that means they got 7 new records in total. Since they traded 2 old records for 1 new one, they must have traded a total of 7 x 2 = 14 old records to get 7 new ones.

So, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to find out how many junior and senior programmers there are, and then multiply the number of each by their respective salaries.

First, let's find out how many junior programmers there are. The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. 

2/5 * 100 = 40

So, there are 40 junior programmers. Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

Now, let's find out the salary of senior programmers. They are paid $400 more than junior programmers, who are paid $2000 per month. 

Senior programmer salary = Junior programmer salary + $400
Senior programmer salary = $2000 + $400
Senior programmer salary = $2400

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.

Total amount = (Number of junior programmers * Junior programmer salary) + (Number of senior programmers * Senior programmer salary)
Total amount = (40 * $2000) + (60 * $2400)
Total amount = $80000 + $144000
Total amount = $184000

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is x.

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people is x + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the number of people left is (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.

Then, 8 more people got in, so the total number of people is (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6.

We are told that at the third stop, there were a total of 20 people. So, we can set up the equation x + 6 = 20.

To solve for x, we need to subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: x = 20 - 6.

x = 14.

"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to know how many percentage points it needs to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs to charge 100% - 60% = 40% more.

Since the phone charges 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we need to find out how many 3-minute intervals are in 40%. 

To do this, we divide 40 by 1 (since it charges 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes). 

40 / 1 = 40

So, it will take 40 intervals of 3 minutes each to charge 40%. 

To find the total time, we multiply the number of intervals by the time per interval: 

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

120 / 60 = 2 hours

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final answer is: 2"
"Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so she now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops. Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so she has 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops left.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we need to find out how many rewards the customer got from their last shopping trip. They spent $80 and get $1 off for every $20 they spend. So, we divide $80 by $20 to get 4. This means they got 4 rewards.

2. Now, we know they used their rewards on this shopping trip. They spent $43 and got 4 rewards, so we subtract the rewards from the price: $43 - $4 = $39.

3. The customer also used a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Twice the amount of rewards is 2 x $4 = $8. So, we subtract $8 from the price: $39 - $8 = $31.

"To find out which job pays more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

Job A: 
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per year: 2000
- Annual income: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B: 
- Annual income: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income before tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- State tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we need to find out which job pays more and how much more. 
Job A pays $24,000 and Job B pays $32,400. Job B pays more.

To find out how much more, we subtract the lower net income from the higher net income:

Half of 88 is 88 / 2 = 44.

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the total cost of each offer, we need to add the advance payment and the total of the monthly installments.

Furniture United's offer: 
Advance payment: $1,350
Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Cozy Homes' offer: 
Advance payment: $1,100
Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, we need to find the cost difference between the two offers:
Cost difference: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

The final answer is: $100"
"To find out how many guns each person would have if they were to share equally, we need to add up all the guns and then divide by the number of people.

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. 

8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24

There are 4 people. 

24 / 4 = 6

So each person would have 6 guns."
"To find out how much sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the total amount of sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge separately, and then add them together.

For the suckers, Mason needs 30 ounces per batch. He needs 8 batches, so we multiply 30 ounces by 8:
30 ounces/batch * 8 batches = 240 ounces

For the fudge, Mason needs 70 ounces per batch. He needs 1 batch, so we multiply 70 ounces by 1:
70 ounces/batch * 1 batch = 70 ounces

Now, we add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge together:
240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the shares after the first year and then after the second year.

First, we find the price of the shares after the first year. The price increases by 50%, so we multiply the original price by 1.5 (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1.5).

Original price = $8
Price after 1 year = $8 * 1.5 = $12

Now, we find the price of the shares after the second year. The price decreases by 25%, so we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%, or 0.75).

Price after 2 years = $12 * 0.75 = $9

Since Maria has 8 shares, we multiply the price after the second year by 8 to find the final value of all her shares.

Final value = $9 * 8 = $72

The final answer is: $72"
"Let's break it down step by step.

Luke ate 2 hot dogs. 
Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate 2 x 3 = 6 hot dogs.
John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

Now, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke. 
John ate 3 hot dogs and Luke ate 2 hot dogs. 
So, John ate 3 - 2 = 1 more hot dog than Luke.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's say the number of students in the two equal groups is x. 

Since the last group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is 200. 

So, we can write the equation: x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 2x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3: x = 70

Since the last group has x - 10 students, the number of students in the last group is 70 - 10 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's say the number of cows is x. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is 2x.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can write an equation:

x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms:

3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 20

So, there are 20 cows and 2x = 40 chickens.

Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. 

The total number of legs of the cows is 20 x 4 = 80.
The total number of legs of the chickens is 40 x 2 = 80.

The total number of legs of all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: 160"
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. So, he has 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7 balls. 

Then, he drops 3 balls, but 2 are caught. So, he loses 1 ball. 

So, Josh has 7 - 1 = 6 balls left.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. A pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle.
2. A pink frog weighs the same as a green toad.
3. A pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
4. A pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake.
5. A pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird.

Since a pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals:

- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 50 + 10 = 60 pounds
- Red bird: 50 - 20 = 30 pounds

Now, we need to find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal. 

The total weight of the animals is: 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 190 pounds
Adding the weight of the container: 190 + 20 = 210 pounds

The final answer is: 210"
"Laurel got 24 outfits from her friend. 
Then she got twice that amount, so 2 x 24 = 48 outfits.

So now she has 72 + 15 = 87 outfits. 

The final answer is 87."
"To find out how many meters Tyson will run in a day according to his coach, we need to multiply 5000 by 1/5. 

5000 * 1/5 = 1000

So, Tyson will run 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters every day.

Since there are 30 days in June, we need to multiply 6000 by 30 to find the total distance covered in June.

6000 * 30 = 180,000

The final answer is: 180,000"
"Let's break it down step by step.

Juice Box A is 4 dollars.
Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it's 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.
Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it's 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, we need to find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B. To do that, we need to subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C. 
11 (price of Juice Box C) - 9 (price of Juice Box B) = 2

"To find the total number of legs, we need to multiply the number of tables with 4 legs by 4 and the number of tables with 3 legs by 3, then add the two results together.

First, we multiply 40 tables with 4 legs by 4: 
40 * 4 = 160

Then, we multiply 50 tables with 3 legs by 3: 
50 * 3 = 150

Now, we add the two results together: 
160 + 150 = 310

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to first find out how many cookies are eaten by her son and her husband. 

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so he eats 4 x 5 = 20 cookies. 

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 x 7 = 7 cookies.

In total, her son and husband eat 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

There are 36 cookies in a bag, and 27 cookies are eaten by her son and husband. So, Jenny eats 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts, we need to first find the discount amount. 

The original price of 2 shirts is 2 x $30 = $60. 

The discount is 40% of $60. To find 40% of $60, we multiply $60 by 0.4 (since 40% is the same as 40/100 or 0.4). 

$60 x 0.4 = $24. 

So the discount is $24. 

Now, we need to subtract the discount from the original price to find out how much Davos paid. 

$60 - $24 = $36.

So Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the percentage more they are making per day now, we need to first find out how much they used to make per day and how much they make now.

They used to sell 10 tractors a day and made $100 per tractor. So, they used to make 10 x $100 = $1000 per day.

Now, they sell 5 silos a day and make $220 per silo. So, they make 5 x $220 = $1100 per day.

To find the percentage more they are making per day now, we need to find the difference between what they make now and what they used to make, and then divide that by what they used to make.

The difference is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

Now, we divide the difference by what they used to make: $100 / $1000 = 0.1.

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.1 x 100 = 10%.

So, they are making 10% more per day now. 

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to first find out how much she spends per month. 

Food costs $25 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply 25 by 4 to get the monthly cost of food. 
25 * 4 = 100

Treats cost $20 per month. 

Medicine costs $100 per month.

Now, we add the monthly costs of food, treats, and medicine to get the total monthly cost. 
100 + 20 + 100 = 220

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 to get the yearly cost. 
220 * 12 = 2640

The final answer is: 2640"
"To find the total hours, we need to add up the hours of each activity.

- Monday's yoga class is 1 hour.
- Tuesday's cooking class is 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so it's 1 * 3 = 3 hours.
- Wednesday's cheese-tasting event is 0.5 hours (half an hour).
- Thursday's museum tour is half as long as the cooking class, so it's 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.
- Friday's errands are 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours: 
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5

"April needs 30 plant pots for the daisies. She needs twice as many for the roses, so she needs 2 x 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses. 

In total, April needs 30 + 60 = 90 plant pots. 

April already had 100 plant pots. To find out how many she has left over, we need to subtract the number of plant pots she needs from the number she already has. 

100 - 90 = 10

So, April has 10 plant pots left over."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Andrea had $36 in the beginning. She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4. 

First, let's add the money she spent: $11 + $4 = $15. 

Now, we need to subtract the money she spent from the money she had in the beginning: $36 - $15 = $21.

So, Andrea saved $21.

"To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to first find out the total time he spent on all activities. 

John spent 6 hours boating. He spent half that time swimming, so he spent 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming. 

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

We know that watching shows was 30% of the total time, and sightseeing was 40% of the total time. Since watching shows was 30%, the total time spent on all activities is 100% / 30% = 10 / 3 = 3.33 times the time spent watching shows. 

So, the total time spent on all activities is 3.33 * 6 = 20 hours.

Now, we know that sightseeing was 40% of the total time, so the time spent sightseeing is 40% of 20 hours, which is 0.4 * 20 = 8 hours.

"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate how much money she has in total and subtract that from the cost of the phone.

First, let's calculate how much money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so she earns 10 * 20 = $200.

Next, let's calculate how much money Annabelle earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so she earns 5 * 15 = $75.

Now, let's add the money Annabelle already has in her savings to the money she earned from both jobs. She already has $80, and she earned $200 + $75 = $275. So, in total, she has $80 + $275 = $355.

Finally, let's subtract the total amount of money Annabelle has from the cost of the phone to find out how much she still needs to save. The phone costs $400, and she has $355, so she still needs to save $400 - $355 = $45.

The final answer is: $45"
"Let's break it down step by step.

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. 
The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it's 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

Now, we need to find the combined height of the two trees. 
The shortest tree is 6 feet tall, and the second tree is 11 feet tall, so the combined height is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined, so it's 2 x 17 = 34 feet tall.

The tallest tree is 34 feet tall."
"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to first calculate how much money he spent. 

Dean bought 6 toy cars for $2 each, so 6 x 2 = 12 dollars. 
Dean bought 5 teddy bears for $1 each, so 5 x 1 = 5 dollars. 
The total amount Dean spent is 12 + 5 = 17 dollars. 

Dean's mother gave him $28 initially. After spending $17, he has 28 - 17 = 11 dollars left. 
Then his mother gave him an extra $10, so he now has 11 + 10 = 21 dollars.

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf is $5 per round, and she wants to play one round, so that's $5. 
The cost of arcade tokens is $5. 
The cost of go-karts is $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice, so that's 2 x $10 = $20.

The total cost of the activities is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

Morgan has a budget of $90, and she wants to know how many friends she can invite. Let's call the number of friends she can invite ""x"". The cost of the activities plus the cost of the friends will be $30 + $5x (since each friend will cost $5). 

We want to find out how many friends she can invite, so we set up the equation: $30 + $5x = $90.

To solve for x, we need to subtract $30 from both sides of the equation: $5x = $90 - $30.
$5x = $60.

Now, we need to divide both sides of the equation by $5 to find x: x = $60 / $5.
x = 12.

So, Morgan can invite 12 friends."

"Let's break this down step by step.

Billy has $10 to spend on candy. He buys candy that costs $1.5 a pound. 

Let's say he buys x pounds of candy. The cost of the candy will be 1.5x dollars.

Since he has $10, the cost of the candy must be less than or equal to $10. So, 1.5x ≤ 10.

To find the maximum amount of candy he can buy, we can divide both sides by 1.5: x ≤ 10 / 1.5
x ≤ 6.67

Since you can't buy a fraction of a pound of candy, Billy can buy a maximum of 6 pounds of candy.

Now, let's find out how much change he gets after buying the candy. The cost of the candy is 1.5x, and he has $10, so the change he gets is 10 - 1.5x.

He takes half of this change and spends it on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs for $0.05 each, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Half of the change is 0.5 * (10 - 1.5x) = 5 - 0.75x.

Since he spent this amount on gumballs, we can set up the equation: 5 - 0.75x = 2.

Now, let's solve for x. Add 0.75x to both sides: 5 = 2 + 0.75x
Subtract 2 from both sides: 3 = 0.75x
Divide both sides by 0.75: x = 4

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy."
"Let's break it down step by step.

Since Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, we can write an equation: 

Carver's age = 2 * son's age - 5 
45 = 2x - 5 

Now, we need to solve for x. 

First, we add 5 to both sides of the equation: 
45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5 
50 = 2x 

Next, we divide both sides by 2: 
50 / 2 = 2x / 2 
25 = x 

So, the son is 25 years old.

"To find the distance from the third city to the first city, we need to add the distances from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city, then subtract 50 miles. 

Distance from first city to second city: 75 miles
Distance from second city to third city: 100 miles
Combined distance: 75 + 100 = 175 miles
Distance from third city to first city: 175 - 50 = 125 miles

Now, we need to find the total distance the train travels in one day. 

Distance from first city to second city: 75 miles
Distance from second city to third city: 100 miles
Distance from third city to first city: 125 miles
Total distance in one day: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles

The train travels 3 times a day, so the total distance it travels in a day is: 
300 miles * 3 = 900 miles

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it travels in a day by the distance it needs to travel before service.

Days between services: 18,000 miles / 900 miles per day = 20 days

10 / 2 = 5

So, a collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

For 4 chihuahua beds: 4 x 2 = 8 pounds
For 3 collie beds: 3 x 5 = 15 pounds

Now, we add the amount of stuffing needed for both types of beds: 
8 + 15 = 23

"To find the total distance John drove to his friend's house, we need to add the detour to the original distance. 

Distance to friend's house = 200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles

Time taken to drive to friend's house = Distance / Speed
Time taken to drive to friend's house = 210 miles / 70 mph
Time taken to drive to friend's house = 3 hours

Now, let's find the time taken to drive back home. 

Distance back home = 240 miles
Speed back home = 80 mph
Time taken to drive back home = Distance / Speed
Time taken to drive back home = 240 miles / 80 mph
Time taken to drive back home = 3 hours

"To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at school on Friday, we need to first find out how many fourth-graders were at school on Friday. 

There were 96 fourth-graders in total. 5 girls and 4 boys were absent, so 5 + 4 = 9 students were absent. 

So, 96 - 9 = 87 students were at school on Friday. 

Since 43 of the 96 students were girls, and 5 girls were absent, 43 - 5 = 38 girls were at school on Friday. 

To find out how many boys were at school on Friday, we need to subtract the number of girls from the total number of students at school. 

87 (total students at school) - 38 (girls at school) = 49 boys at school.

"Let's break down the information given:

- 3 customers were kicked out for not wearing masks.
- A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
  So, 4 * 3 = 12, then 12 - 5 = 7 were kicked out for shoplifting.
- Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
  So, 3 * 7 = 21 were kicked out for physical violence.

Now, let's add up the numbers of people kicked out for each reason:
3 (not wearing masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) = 31

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

First, let's find the cost of the picture frames. There are 44 seniors, and each picture frame costs $20. So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 x $20 = $880.

Next, we need to find the cost of etching the logo on each picture frame. The etching costs 20% of the cost of the picture frame, which is 20% of $20. To find 20% of $20, we multiply $20 by 0.2, which is $4. So, the cost of etching each picture frame is $4. Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost of etching is 44 x $4 = $176.

Now, let's find the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 x $5 = $10.

Next, we need to find the number of officers. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so 1/4 of 44 is 11. The cost of the cords for the officers is $12 each, and there are 11 officers. So, the total cost of the cords is 11 x $12 = $132.

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords. The total cost is $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"

20% of $400 is 0.2 x 400 = $80. 

So, the cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper is $400 - $80 = $320.

The total cost is the cost of materials, which is $320."

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, so they sold 2 x 14 = 28 pairs of shoes.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they sold on Saturday, so they sold 28 / 2 = 14 pairs of shoes.

In total, they sold 14 + 28 + 14 = 56 pairs of shoes.

However, 6 people returned their pairs because they didn't fit, so we need to subtract those from the total number of pairs sold.

56 - 6 = 50

So, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 50 pairs."

"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the value of the faulty pieces of equipment. 

The total value of the equipment is $400000. 40% of the total value is faulty. 

To find 40% of $400000, we multiply $400000 by 0.4 (since 40% is the same as 40/100 or 0.4).

$400000 * 0.4 = $160000

This is the value of the faulty pieces of equipment. To find the value of the functioning pieces of equipment, we need to subtract the value of the faulty pieces from the total value.

$400000 - $160000 = $240000

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240000.

"To find out how much milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from the half of the sheep that gives 1 kg of milk and the half that gives 2 kg of milk.

Half of the sheep is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

The first half gives 1 kg of milk each, so 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

The second half gives 2 kg of milk each, so 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

Now, we add the milk from both halves: 15 + 30 = 45 kg of milk.

The final answer is: 45"
"Mrs. Sherman started with a dozen bread rolls, which is 12 rolls. She fed 6 of them to her children, so she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left. 

She broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces, so she had 6 x 8 = 48 pieces of rolls. 

The answer is 48."
"To find out how many pupils like the color yellow, we need to first find out how many pupils like blue, then how many like green, and then subtract those from the total number of pupils.

Half of the class likes blue. Half of 40 is 40 / 2 = 20. So, 20 pupils like blue.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20. One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5. So, 5 pupils like green.

Now, we need to find out how many pupils like yellow. The remaining pupils are 20 - 5 = 15. So, 15 pupils like yellow.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples picked and got $56. Since she sells each apple for $4, we can find out how many apples she picked on Monday by dividing the money she got by the price per apple: $56 ÷ $4 = 14 apples.

2. On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.

3. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 x 12 = 24 apples.

4. To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we add the apples picked each day: 14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many socks Lindsay has washed, we need to know that a pair of socks has 2 socks. 

She washed 10 pairs of socks, so that's 10 x 2 = 20 socks. 
She also washed 15 loose socks. 
So, in total, she washed 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks that need washing, we need to subtract the number of socks she washed from the total number of socks. 
50 - 35 = 15

So, Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to add the cookies she bought and the cookies Janet gave her, then subtract the cookies her brother ate.

First, let's add the cookies Rachel bought and Janet gave her: 
23 (cookies Rachel bought) + 42 (cookies Janet gave her) = 65 cookies

Now, let's subtract the cookies her brother ate:
65 (total cookies) - 44 (cookies eaten) = 21 cookies

So, there are 21 cookies left for Rachel."
"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest she has to pay and then divide it by the number of months.

The formula to calculate simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Principal = $3,650
Rate = 10% or 0.10
Time = 5 months

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we need to add the interest to the principal to find the total amount Karan has to pay:
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5:
Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
Monthly Payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly Payment = $1,095

The final answer is: $1,095"
"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours, so Cho hiked 14 x 8 = 112 kilometers.

To find out how far Chloe hiked, we need to multiply Chloe's speed by the time. Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours, so Chloe hiked 9 x 5 = 45 kilometers.

Now, we need to find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked than Chloe. To do this, we need to subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked. 112 - 45 = 67.

The final answer is: 67"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. 

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 

Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add up the total number of silver pesos they have together: 50 (Axel's silver pesos) + 100 (Anna's silver pesos) = 150 silver pesos.

Next, let's add up the total number of gold pesos they have together: 80 (Axel's gold pesos) + 120 (Anna's gold pesos) = 200 gold pesos.

To find the total number of pesos they have together, we add the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos: 150 (silver pesos) + 200 (gold pesos) = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"To find out how much profit Millie will make per hour, we need to know how much money she makes per hour and how much she spends per hour.

First, let's find out how much money she makes per hour. She sells 4 cups of lemonade per hour and each cup costs $1, so she makes 4 x $1 = $4 per hour.

Next, let's find out how much she spends per hour. She spends $18 to buy supplies for 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups, so she has 3 x 12 = 36 cups of lemonade. She sells all of the lemonade, so she sells 36 cups. She makes $4 per hour, and she sells 4 cups per hour, so she sells all of the lemonade in 36 / 4 = 9 hours. She spends $18 to make 36 cups of lemonade, so she spends $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

Now, let's find out how much profit she makes per hour. She makes $4 per hour and she spends $2 per hour, so she makes a profit of $4 - $2 = $2 per hour.

"First, we need to find out how many girls are in the choir. Since 50% of the choir are girls, we can find this by multiplying 52 by 0.5. 

52 * 0.5 = 26

So, there are 26 girls in the choir. 

Now, half of the girls can't make it to the show, so we need to find half of 26. 

26 / 2 = 13

So, 13 girls can't make it to the show. 

Now, we need to find out how many girls are performing. We subtract the number of girls who can't make it from the total number of girls.

26 - 13 = 13

Now, we add the 3 teachers who are singing with the girls.

"To find out how much money David saves, we need to calculate how much Dasha would have spent if she bought a ride bracelet and then subtract that from the cost of the ride bracelet David bought.

Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so each ride costs 2 x $2 = $4.

If Dasha bought a ride bracelet, she would have spent $30.

Since they rode all 9 rides, Dasha would have spent $30 on a ride bracelet, but she would have gotten 9 rides out of it.  Since each ride costs $4, she would have spent $4 x 9 = $36 on tickets if she didn't buy a ride bracelet.

The cost of the ride bracelet David bought is $30, and the cost of the tickets Dasha would have bought is $36.  So, David saves $36 - $30 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"

"To find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have, we need to add the parts of the ratio together. 5 + 6 = 11. 

Now, we need to divide the total number of popsicles (165) by the sum of the parts of the ratio (11) to find out how many popsicles each part represents. 165 / 11 = 15.

Since Betty has 5 parts, we multiply 5 by 15 to find out how many popsicles she has. 5 x 15 = 75.

Since Sam has 6 parts, we multiply 6 by 15 to find out how many popsicles he has. 6 x 15 = 90.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has. 90 - 75 = 15.

"To find out how much Tim saves, we need to first find out how much he pays for the streaming services. 

Netflix costs $10 a month. 

Hulu and Disney Plus cost $10 each, but he gets a 20% discount for bundling. 20% of $20 (10 + 10) is 0.2 x 20 = $4. 

So, the total cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the discount is $20 - $4 = $16. 

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26. 

He saves $60 (cable package) - $26 (streaming services) = $34.

"To find the total time Carol spent, we need to add up the time she spent writing, recording, and editing the song.

She spent 4 hours writing the song. 
She spent half of that time recording the song, which is 4 / 2 = 2 hours.
She spent 90 minutes editing the song. To convert this to hours, we need to divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours.

Now, let's add up the total time: 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours.

To find the percentage of time she spent editing, we need to divide the time she spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100. 

Time spent editing / Total time = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

"To find out how many books Wendy needs, we first need to find out how many books are already in the shelving system. 

There are 6 rows and 6 columns, so we multiply the number of rows by the number of columns to find the total number of spaces. 

6 rows * 6 columns = 36 spaces

Since each space can hold one book, there are 36 books already in the shelving system.

Now, Wendy wants to add 20 more than double the number of books. To find double the number of books, we multiply the number of books by 2.

36 books * 2 = 72 books

"To find out how many slices Jenny gave to Bill and Mark, we need to add the fractions 1/3 and 1/4. 

First, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12. 

Now, we convert 1/3 to have a denominator of 12: 1/3 = 4/12. 

We convert 1/4 to have a denominator of 12: 1/4 = 3/12.

Now we can add the fractions: 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12. 

Jenny gave 7/12 of the pizza to Bill and Mark. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we can multiply 7/12 by 12 to find out how many slices they got: 7/12 * 12 = 7 slices.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so we need to subtract 2 from the total number of slices: 12 - 7 - 2 = 3.

"To find the total number of bugs, we need to find the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Nancy saw 90 spiders. 
She saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders. 
1/3 of 90 is 90 / 3 = 30 millipedes.

She saw a number of stink bugs equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. 
Twice the number of millipedes is 2 * 30 = 60. 
60 - 12 = 48 stink bugs.

Now, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs. 
90 (spiders) + 30 (millipedes) + 48 (stink bugs) = 168

"To find out how many bags of flour Mark needs, we need to multiply the amount of flour in the recipe by 4 since it's a quadruple batch. 

3 cups of flour * 4 = 12 cups of flour

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we need to divide the total amount of flour needed by 2 to find out how many bags Mark needs to buy.

12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

To find out how many bottles of milk Mark needs, we multiply the amount of milk in the recipe by 4.

1 cup of milk * 4 = 4 cups of milk

Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we need to divide the total amount of milk needed by 2 to find out how many bottles Mark needs to buy.

4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

Now, we need to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy. We subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour.

6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

"To find out how much energy Mel uses in one day, we need to multiply the power of the air conditioner (in watts) by the number of hours it's used. 

900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use it for 3 hours a day. 

3 hours * 900 watts = 2700 watt-hours or 2.7 kWh per day.

To find out how much energy he saves in one day, we need to subtract the new energy usage from the old energy usage.

7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh per day.

To find out how much energy he saves in 30 days, we need to multiply the daily energy saved by 30.

4.5 kWh * 30 = 135 kWh.

"To find the average number of stripes, we need to find the total number of stripes and divide it by the number of zebras.

First, let's find the total number of stripes on the two zebras with 17 stripes each. 
2 zebras * 17 stripes = 34 stripes

Then, we add the stripes of the zebra with 36 stripes.
34 stripes + 36 stripes = 70 stripes

Next, we find the number of stripes on the zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes. 
Half of 36 is 18.
So, the zebra has 18 stripes.

Now, we add the stripes of this zebra to the total.
70 stripes + 18 stripes = 88 stripes

There are 4 zebras in total. 
Now, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras to find the average.
88 stripes / 4 zebras = 22 stripes

"To find out how much money Tyson would spend, we need to figure out how many sandwiches he needs to make and how much meat and cheese he needs for those sandwiches.

Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people in total, we need to divide 20 by 4 to find out how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make. 

20 / 4 = 5

So, Tyson needs to make 5 sandwiches. 

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so Tyson needs 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of meat will cost 5 x $7.00 = $35.00.

The cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of cheese will cost 5 x $3.00 = $15.00.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he has 2 x 40 = 80 corns.

2. Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store. So now he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.

3. He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he has 100 cannolis, he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

4. Now, Allan has 80 (initial corns) + 60 (new corns) = 140 corns.

5. The total number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 140 (corns) + 100 (cannolis) = 240.

"To find out how many minutes it will take Toby to read the book, we need to multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page and then divide by the number of words Toby can read per minute.

Number of words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words
Time to read the book = 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so Toby will be at the airport in 30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes.

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, so we need to subtract the time it will take him to get to the airport from the time he has to be there to find out how many minutes early he will be.

Minutes early = 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes"
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks (since there are 4 weeks in May). So, the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The company paid each employee $15 per hour, so the total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. Since there are 40 employees, the total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. So, the company had 40 - 10 = 30 employees in June. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks in June, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The company paid each employee $15 per hour, so the total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. Since there are 30 employees, the total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that the second pound is half off, so it costs $1.50. So, the total cost of 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. Sally bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework.

The first package of fireworks costs $400. The second package costs twice that much, so it's 2 x $400 = $800.

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks. To find 20% of $1200, we multiply $1200 by 0.2, which is $240. So the discount is $240.

The cost of the fireworks after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150.

The total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

"To find the number of candles that smell like wet dog, we need to find 5% of 50000. 

5% of 50000 = 0.05 * 50000 = 2500 candles that smell like wet dog.

Since the candles that smell like wet dog are the more dangerous ones, we can assume that the 99% guarantee applies to the remaining candles. This means 1% of the candles are the more dangerous ones. 

1% of 50000 = 0.01 * 50000 = 500 candles that are more dangerous.

Since 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog, we need to find 5% of 500.

5% of 500 = 0.05 * 500 = 25 candles that both smell like wet dog and explode.

70% of $20 is 0.7 x $20 = $14.

Now, we need to find the total cost of 4 blouses at the discounted price. 

The total cost is 4 x $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- Joanne gathers some apples from the average trees, but we don't know how many yet.
- Her sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as 'x'. 

The total number of apples Joanne gathers is 30 (from the tallest trees) + 15 (from the shortest trees) + x (from the average trees) = 45 + x.

The total number of apples her sister gathers is 60 (from the tallest trees) + 45 (from the shortest trees) = 105.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can write the equation: (45 + x) + 105 = 500.

Now, let's solve for x:
(45 + x) + 105 = 500
Combine like terms: 150 + x = 500
Subtract 150 from both sides: x = 350

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's say the number of camels is C and the number of dromedaries is D. 

We know that the total number of heads is 180, so C + D = 180.

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304. Since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump, the total number of bumps is 2C + D = 304.

Now we have two equations:

C + D = 180
2C + D = 304

We can subtract the first equation from the second equation to get:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know C, we can find D by substituting C into one of the original equations:

D = 180 - C
D = 180 - 124
D = 56

So, there are 56 dromedaries. 

56"
"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

First, let's find the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. 
Distance = 200 kilometers/day * 4 days = 800 kilometers.

Next, let's find the distance Tom traveled over the next two days. 
He traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 
Distance = 30% * 800 kilometers = 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, the total distance Tom traveled in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the 7th day, he didn't travel at all, so we don't need to add anything to the total.

Now, let's find the distance Tom traveled during the second week. 
Distance = 300 kilometers/day * 7 days = 2100 kilometers.

Finally, let's add up the distances to find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip.
Total distance = 1040 kilometers + 0 kilometers (7th day) + 2100 kilometers = 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is: 3140"

1. Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. So, Zack's locker is 4 times bigger than Peter's locker. 
   Zack's locker = 4 * 5 = 20 cubic inches
3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. So, Timothy's locker is 2 times bigger than Zack's locker.
   Timothy's locker = 2 * 20 = 40 cubic inches

"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb, we need to find the difference between Stanley's elevation and Oliver's elevation. 

Stanley's elevation is 10,000 feet. 
Oliver's elevation is 3,000 feet.

The difference between their elevations is 10,000 - 3,000 = 7,000 feet.

So, Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital. 

The first bank gave him $4000. 

The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 x $4000 = $8000.

So, the total amount of money Mr. Josue got from the banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Now, let's add the money he got from the banks to his initial capital: $5000 + $12000 = $16000.

The final answer is: $16000"
"First, 4 boats came and took 5 cats each. So, 4 x 5 = 20 cats left the rock. 

Now, there are 50 - 20 = 30 cats left on the rock.

Then, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. 3/5 of 30 is 18. 

So, 18 cats left the rock. 

Now, there are 30 - 18 = 12 cats left on the rock.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how much 2 years of the service cost Bill, we need to break it down into parts. 

First, we need to find out how many months are in 2 years. There are 12 months in a year, so 2 years have 2 x 12 = 24 months.

The first 6 months were $8 a month, so that's 6 x $8 = $48.

Then, the next 8 months were $12 a month, so that's 8 x $12 = $96.

After that, the price went up to $14 a month. Since there are 24 months in 2 years and we already counted 6 + 8 = 14 months, we have 24 - 14 = 10 months left. So, 10 x $14 = $140.

Now, we add up the costs: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The final answer is: $284"
"Let's break it down step by step.

1. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. 
   So, if the tattered jeans cost $28, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

2. Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. 
   Let's say the savings from the jogger jeans is x. Then, the savings from the tattered jeans is 2x (since the rest of the savings is from the tattered jeans).

   We know that x + 2x = $6 (total savings). 
   3x = $6
   x = $6 / 3
   x = $2

   So, the savings from the jogger jeans is $2 and the savings from the tattered jeans is 2x = 2 * $2 = $4.

3. The savings from the jogger jeans is $2, and the jogger jeans cost $22. 
   So, the original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $24.

4. The original price of the jogger jeans is $24 and the original price of the tattered jeans is $28. 
   The difference is $24 - $28 = -$4. But since we can't have a negative price difference, we need to find the difference in the other direction. 
   The difference is actually $28 - $24 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"

Next, let's find the total capacity of the minibusses: 
6 minibusses * 30 employees/minibus = 180 employees

Then, let's find the total capacity of the minivans: 
10 minivans * 15 employees/minivan = 150 employees

Now, let's add the capacities of all the vehicles together:

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Lillian made 3 bird feeders and bought 3 bird feeders. So, in total, she has 3 + 3 = 6 bird feeders.

The store-bought bird feeders attract 20 birds each. The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Since there are 3 store-bought bird feeders, they attract 3 x 20 = 60 birds. And since there are 3 bird feeders Lillian made herself, they attract 3 x 30 = 90 birds.

In total, Lillian can expect to see 60 + 90 = 150 birds in her garden each day.

"To find out how much Aleksandra paid, we need to calculate the cost of each item. 

The bagel costs $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.25 (which is 25% as a decimal). 
$4 x 0.25 = $1. 
So the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5. 
The cake costs half of the price of the bagel. Half of $4 is $4 / 2 = $2. 

Now, we add up the cost of all the items: 
$4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Kenny has $50 in spending cash and he needs $100 to go to the amusement park. So, he needs $100 - $50 = $50 more to buy the ticket.

He plans to sell his cards for $1.5 each. To find out how many cards he needs to sell, we can divide the amount he needs ($50) by the price of each card ($1.5).

$50 ÷ $1.5 = 33.33

Since Kenny can't sell a fraction of a card, we'll round down to 33 cards. This is the number of cards he needs to sell to get the remaining $50.

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sells is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's call the total number of cards he started with ""x"".

2/3 of x = 33

To find x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2.

x = 33 × (3/2)
x = 49.5

Since Kenny can't have a fraction of a card, we'll round up to 50 cards."
"The caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the guests to have 2 hotdogs. Since there are 36 guests, half of them is 36 / 2 = 18. So, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 18 guests to have 2 hotdogs each. 

18 guests having 2 hotdogs will be 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs. 

Now, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. So, 40 guests will have 2 hotdogs each, which is 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs. 

Since the caterer only prepared 36 hotdogs, he will run out of hotdogs. The number of guests who got a second hotdog is 40, and the number of hotdogs prepared is 36. So, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 36.

However, the question asks for the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog, but it is actually asking for the number of guests who got a second hotdog. The number of guests who got a second hotdog is 40 - 36 = 4."
"To find out how many letters are in Indras' sister's name, we need to first find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters in her name. Half of 6 is 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we need to add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name to find the total number of letters. 

6 (Indras' name) + 7 (sister's name) = 13

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to first find the total cost of the items before the discount. 

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00. 
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00. 
The cost of the 5 separate utensils is 5 x $5.00 = $25.00. 

So, the total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Now, we need to find 20% of $165.00 to calculate the discount. 
20% of $165.00 is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost. 
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

"To find out how much gas Josey needed, we need to find out how much gas is in one container and then multiply it by 1/4.

First, we need to divide 15 gallons by 5 containers. 

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we need to convert gallons to pints. 

3 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints per container

Now, we need to find 1/4 of a container. 

1/4 * 24 pints = 6 pints

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"Let's break this down step by step.

George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, which means he spent 99% of his money. 

Since 1% of his money is left, 99% of his money is spent. 99% of $5 is 0.99 * 5 = $4.95.

He spent $4.95 on chips and candy bars. 

He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so he spent 3 * 0.40 = $1.20 on chips.

Now, let's subtract the money he spent on chips from the total money he spent: $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75.

He spent $3.75 on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide $3.75 by 0.75 to find out how many candy bars he bought: $3.75 / 0.75 = 5.

First, we know that it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater. Since Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, Bernadette's drive will take 4 x 4 = 16 minutes.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 4 + 5 = 9 minutes before Wayne.

So Bernadette should leave 9 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to know the length and width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. 

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so 3 yards is equal to 3 x 3 = 9 feet.

Now we need to find the width of the room. The area of a rectangle is equal to the length times the width. So, we can divide the area by the length to find the width. 

360 / 9 = 40 feet. 

Now that we know the length and width, we can find the perimeter. The perimeter of a rectangle is equal to 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. 

Perimeter = 2(length + width)
Perimeter = 2(9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 x 49
Perimeter = 98

"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to multiply the number of packs of beads by the number of beads in each pack.

Elizabeth has 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since the color of the beads doesn't matter, we can just add the packs together. So Elizabeth has 1 + 2 = 3 packs of beads. Since each pack has 20 beads, Elizabeth has 3 x 20 = 60 beads.

Margareth has 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Again, we can just add the packs together. So Margareth has 3 + 4 = 7 packs of beads. Since each pack has 20 beads, Margareth has 7 x 20 = 140 beads.

Now we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth. To do this, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has. 140 - 60 = 80.

"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature after Marcus bakes and then after he opens the window.

First, let's calculate the temperature after Marcus bakes. He bakes for 3 hours, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase is 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.

The initial temperature is 40 degrees, and the temperature increases by 15 degrees, so the temperature after baking is 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature after Marcus opens the window. He opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. So, the total temperature decrease is (30 minutes / 10 minutes) * 2 degrees = 6 degrees.

The temperature after baking is 55 degrees, and the temperature decreases by 6 degrees, so the final temperature is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we need to first find out how long it took James to do the swim and bike ride. 

The swim took Jon 40 minutes. James finished the swim 10% faster, so we need to find 10% of 40 and subtract it from 40. 10% of 40 is 4, so James finished the swim in 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

The bike ride took Jon 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. James took 5 minutes longer, so James took 80 + 5 = 85 minutes for the bike ride.

Now we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. This means that the total time for James was 10 minutes more than Jon's total time. Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes. So James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now we can find out how long it took James to do the run by subtracting the time for the swim and bike ride from James' total time. 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

Movie C is 1.25 hours. We need to convert this to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we multiply 1.25 by 60.

1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so we add 5 to the length of Movie C.

75 + 5 = 80 minutes

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so we divide the length of Movie B by 4.

80 / 4 = 20 minutes

"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to find out how many miles it runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes, we need to convert the time to hours. 

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours.

The horse runs at 32MPH, so in 0.5 hours, it will run 32 * 0.5 = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so 8 bails will cost 8 * 3 = $24.

Michael has 6 five-dollar bills, which is 6 * 5 = $30.

To find out how much change he has after buying the hay, we need to subtract the cost of the hay from the amount of money he has.

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. 

To find the cost per sneaker, we divide the total cost by the number of sneakers:
$576 ÷ 48 = $12 per sneaker

The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each on Monday. 
The revenue from Monday's sale is:
17 x $20 = $340

The salesman sold the rest of the sneakers (48 - 17 = 31) for $25 each throughout the rest of the week.
The revenue from the rest of the week's sale is:
31 x $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from Monday's sale and the rest of the week's sale:

If you bought the super ticket, it would cost $20. If you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2, then the total cost would be $20 - $2 = $18.

You bought a movie ticket for $12, so the remaining cost would be $18 - $12 = $6. This $6 is the cost of one popcorn and a soda.

Since the soda costs $3, the cost of the popcorn would be $6 - $3 = $3.

The regular price of popcorn is $3."
"Let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. To find the cost of filling one balloon, we need to divide the total cost by the number of balloons.

Cost per balloon = Total cost / Number of balloons
Cost per balloon = $900 / 20
Cost per balloon = $45

Now, we know that the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:

New cost per balloon = Old cost per balloon + Increase in cost
New cost per balloon = $45 + $20
New cost per balloon = $65

Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. To do this, we multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

Total cost = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
Total cost = $65 * 170
Total cost = $11,050

"To find the average speed, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's find the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 x 2
Distance = 120 miles

Then, let's find the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 x 1
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 + 30
Total Distance = 150 miles

Next, let's find the total time taken:
Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour
Total Time = 3 hours

Now, we can find the average speed:

"Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. 

First, let's find out how many sapphires she has left. 
8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

Now, let's find out how much money her sapphires are worth. 
5 sapphires * $800 = $4000

Now, let's find out how much money her rubies are worth. 
2 rubies * $1200 = $2400

Now, let's add the value of her sapphires and rubies together. 
$4000 + $2400 = $6400

"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to add the number of apples they eat each day and multiply it by 30.

Marin eats 4 apples a day and Nancy eats 4 apples a day. 

4 (Marin's apples per day) + 4 (Nancy's apples per day) = 8 apples per day

Now, we multiply 8 apples per day by 30 days.

8 apples per day * 30 days = 240 apples

The final answer is: 240"
"To find out how much potting soil Bob needs, we need to find the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds. 

The volume of one raised bed is its length times its width times its height. 

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 8 * 2 * 2
Volume = 32 cubic feet

Since there are 10 raised beds, we multiply the volume of one bed by 10.

Total volume = 32 * 10
Total volume = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so we need to divide the total volume by 2 to find out how many bags Bob needs.

Number of bags = Total volume / 2
Number of bags = 320 / 2
Number of bags = 160

Each bag costs $12, so we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag to find the total cost.

Total cost = Number of bags * cost per bag
Total cost = 160 * 12
Total cost = 1920

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the number of green cards, we need to calculate 60% of the red cards and add it to the number of red cards. 

60% of 15 is 0.6 x 15 = 9. 
So, the number of green cards is 15 + 9 = 24.

The number of yellow cards is the sum of red and green cards, which is 15 + 24 = 39.

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards: 15 + 24 + 39 = 78.

The final answer is: 78"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Katelyn saw 50 fairies initially.
2. Then, half as many fairies as Katelyn saw came from the east. Half of 50 is 25, so 25 more fairies joined the group.
   Total fairies now = 50 + 25 = 75
3. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away.
   Remaining fairies = 75 - 30 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to find the total number of puppies and the number of puppies with spots. 

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots. Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots. 

First, we add the number of puppies from both dogs: 8 + 12 = 20 puppies in total.

Then, we add the number of puppies with spots from both dogs: 3 + 4 = 7 puppies with spots.

Now, we need to find the percentage of puppies with spots. To do this, we divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.

(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

So, 35% of all the puppies have spots.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we need to calculate the total weight of all the feed and divide it by the weight his truck can carry.

First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound per box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds per bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds per bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds per sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:
2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds

Since the farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight by the weight his truck can carry:
3400 / 2250 = 1.511 (round up to 2 because you can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns in a week, we need to calculate the total amount she earns from recycling aluminum cans and plastic bottles.

For aluminum cans: 
Grayson drinks 3 cans a week. Each can is worth 2 cents. 
So, 3 cans * 2 cents = 6 cents per week from aluminum cans.

For plastic bottles: 
Grayson drinks 5 bottles a week. Each bottle is worth 3 cents. 
So, 5 bottles * 3 cents = 15 cents per week from plastic bottles.

Now, let's add the amount she earns from both aluminum cans and plastic bottles: 
6 cents (aluminum cans) + 15 cents (plastic bottles) = 21 cents per week.

Since we want to know how much she earns in a four-week month, we multiply the weekly earnings by 4:
21 cents * 4 = 84 cents.

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's break it down step by step.

Frederick has 10 plants. 
Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. 
60% of 10 is 0.6 x 10 = 6.

"To find out how much Ali has now, we need to know how much Leila gave him. Leila gave him half of her $100, so we need to divide 100 by 2 to find out how much she gave him.

100 / 2 = 50

So Leila gave Ali $50. Now we need to add this to the $21 Ali already had.

21 + 50 = 71

Ali now has $71."
"To find the tip, we need to find 1/5 of the cost of the pizza. 

1/5 of $15 is calculated by multiplying 15 by 1/5.

"To find out how many cards Miss Maria has in total, we need to calculate the number of basketball cards and baseball cards separately and then add them together.

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck. So, the total number of basketball cards is 6 x 25 = 150.

She has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box. So, the total number of baseball cards is 5 x 40 = 200.

Now, we add the total number of basketball cards and baseball cards together: 150 + 200 = 350.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the remaining cards are 350 - 50 = 300.

If her students got 10 cards each, we need to divide the remaining cards by 10 to find out how many students she has: 300 ÷ 10 = 30.

"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to subtract the discount from the total cost of the apples. 

First, let's find the total cost of the apples Becky bought. 
20 apples * 45 cents = 20 * 0.45 = $9
Then, we subtract the discount from the total cost. 
$9 - $1 = $8

Now, let's find the total cost of the apples Kelly bought. 
20 apples * 50 cents = 20 * 0.5 = $10
Then, we find 10 percent of the total cost and subtract it from the total cost. 
10% of $10 = 0.1 * $10 = $1
$10 - $1 = $9

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky. 
$9 - $8 = $1

"To find the total number of pieces of laundry, we need to calculate the number of each item in one room and then multiply it by the number of rooms.

Each room has:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- Twice as many pillow cases as sheets: 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases
- Twice as many towels as pillow cases: 2 * 4 = 8 towels

So, in one room, there are 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15 pieces of laundry.

Now, we multiply the number of pieces of laundry in one room by the number of rooms: 15 * 80 = 1200

The final answer is: 1200"
"Let's break it down step by step:

Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, he gets 5 x 2 = 10 shoes.

Now, he has 200 + 10 = 210 shoes.

On Wednesday, he gets 15 new pairs of shoes. Again, each pair has 2 shoes, so he gets 15 x 2 = 30 shoes.

Now, he has 210 + 30 = 240 shoes.

On Friday, he gets 30 new pairs of shoes. Each pair has 2 shoes, so he gets 30 x 2 = 60 shoes.

Now, he has 240 + 60 = 300 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.

Now, he has 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

So, on Sunday, Fireman Frank will have 120 shoes.

The final answer is: 120"

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is x. 

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, so he can have x/2 cookies. 

He also gets 2 extra cookies for cleaning his room. 

So, the total number of cookies he can have is x/2 + 2. 

We know that Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total. 

So, we can set up the equation: x/2 + 2 = 5 

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. 

First, we subtract 2 from both sides: x/2 = 5 - 2 
x/2 = 3 

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: x = 3 * 2 
x = 6

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to multiply the number of remoras by their length. 

2 remoras * 6 inches = 12 inches

Now, we need to convert the shark's length to inches because the remoras' length is in inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches
10 feet = 10 * 12 = 120 inches

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. 

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / shark's length) * 100
= (12 / 120) * 100
= 0.1 * 100

To find the total number of books, we divide the total money spent by the cost of each book: 

$300 ÷ $15 = 20 books

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we need to divide the total number of books by 4:

20 books ÷ 4 kids = 5 books per kid

So each child got 5 books."
"To find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we need to know how many kids are allergic to at least one thing. We can do this by adding the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts, then subtracting the number of kids allergic to both because they were counted twice.

Number of kids allergic to dairy: 9
Number of kids allergic to peanuts: 6
Number of kids allergic to both: 3

Total number of kids allergic to at least one thing: 9 + 6 - 3 = 12

Now, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one thing from the total number of kids in the class to find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything.

Total number of kids in the class: 32

"To find out how much each individual razor will cost after the discount, we need to first find out how much Heather will pay for 2 packs of razors.

Since the razors are buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Heather also has a $2.00 coupon, so she will get a discount of $2.00.

So, the total amount Heather will pay for 2 packs of razors is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, 2 packs will have 2 x 4 = 8 razors.

To find out the cost of each individual razor, we need to divide the total amount Heather will pay by the number of razors.

"Let's break down the costs for each venue.

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200, plus $5 for each guest. If there are x guests, the total cost is $200 + $5x.

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per guest. If there are x guests, the total cost is $25x.

Since we want the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation:

$200 + $5x = $25x

To solve for x, we need to get all the x terms on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting $5x from both sides:

$200 = $20x

Now, we can divide both sides by $20 to solve for x:

x = $200 / $20
x = 10

So, Mark needs 10 guests for the two venues to be equal in cost.

Let's say David found x insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found x + 7 insects. 

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found. So, Bodhi found 2x insects (since David found half of Bodhi's insects).

We know that together they collected 43 insects. So, the total number of insects they found is the sum of what Lily, David, and Bodhi found. 

x + (x + 7) + 2x = 43

Combine like terms: 
4x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides: 
4x = 36

Divide both sides by 4: 
x = 9

Since Lily found x + 7 insects, and x is 9, Lily found 9 + 7 = 16 insects.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many yards of yarn they used altogether, we need to find out how many yards Mariah's grandma used and add it to the yards Mariah used.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we multiply 364 by 1/4.

364 * 1/4 = 364 / 4 = 91 yards

Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn. We multiply 364 by 1/2.

364 * 1/2 = 364 / 2 = 182 yards

Now, we add the yards Mariah used to the yards her grandma used.

91 + 182 = 273 yards

So, they used 273 yards of yarn altogether."
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to add the gifts for her 2 friends who want 5 gifts and the gifts for her 3 friends who want 2 gifts.

For the 2 friends who want 5 gifts: 2 friends * 5 gifts = 10 gifts
For the 3 friends who want 2 gifts: 3 friends * 2 gifts = 6 gifts

Now, we add the gifts for both groups: 10 gifts + 6 gifts = 16 gifts

Cherrie also bought 10 more random gifts. So, we add those to the total: 16 gifts + 10 gifts = 26 gifts

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the length of the couch, we need to find the width of the rug first. 

The chair is 3 feet wide. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so the rug is 3 + 5 = 8 feet wide.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 x 8 = 16 feet. 2 feet longer than that is 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

The couch is 18 feet long."
"Let's break down the information given. 

Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total. 
- 2 packs are strawberry gum.
- 1 pack is grape gum, which costs $2.
- 1 pack is green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum. 
  Since the grape gum costs $2, the green apple gum costs $2 / 2 = $1.

We know that Suzie paid $7 in total. 
So, the cost of the strawberry gum is $7 - $2 (grape gum) - $1 (green apple gum) = $4.

Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, we need to divide the total cost of the strawberry gum by 2 to find the cost of each pack. 
$4 / 2 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to figure out how many sticks he can get from each piece of wood and then decide which one is the cheapest.

A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and gives 200 sticks. 
A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and gives 400 sticks.

To find out how many sticks he can get for $24, we need to divide $24 by the cost of each piece of wood and multiply by the number of sticks it gives.

For a 2 x 4 piece of wood: $24 / $4 = 6, 6 * 200 = 1200 sticks
For a 2 x 8 piece of wood: $24 / $6 = 4, 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks

Since 1600 is more than 1200, the 2 x 8 piece of wood is the cheapest option. 

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find out how much it will cost Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs, we need to first find out how many snowshoes he needs. Since each dog has 4 legs, and he has 6 dogs, we multiply the number of dogs by the number of legs each dog has.

6 dogs * 4 legs = 24 legs

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the total number of snowshoes needed.

24 legs / 2 = 12 snowshoes

Now, we know that each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00. Since we need 12 snowshoes, we multiply the number of snowshoes by the cost of each pair.

12 snowshoes * $12.00 = $144.00

So, it will cost Mario $144.00 to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs.

$144.00"
"To find out how much Janet spends on bus trips in a week, we need to multiply the cost of one bus trip by the number of bus trips she takes in a week. 

Cost of one bus trip: $2.20
Number of bus trips in a week: 5

Cost of bus trips in a week = Cost of one bus trip * Number of bus trips in a week
Cost of bus trips in a week = $2.20 * 5
Cost of bus trips in a week = $11

Now, we need to find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass for $20. 

Amount saved = Cost of bus trips in a week - Cost of weekly bus pass
Amount saved = $11 - $20
Amount saved = -$9

Since we can't save a negative amount, it seems like Janet would actually spend more money by buying a weekly bus pass. However, the question asks for the amount she would save, so we will provide the answer as a negative number.

The final answer is: -$9"
"Let's break this down step by step.

The farm has 30 cows. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 x 30 = 60 cows.

The zoo has 20 sheep. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals on the farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals on the zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

Finally, let's add up the total number of animals on the farm and the zoo: 40 animals (farm) + 80 animals (zoo) = 120 animals.

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's say Sophia bought x onions and y potatoes. We know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, so Rose bought 4x onions and 4y potatoes. 

We are also given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. This means 4x = 12 and 4y = 4. 

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation 4x = 12 by 4. This gives us x = 3. 

To find the value of y, we can divide both sides of the equation 4y = 4 by 4. This gives us y = 1.

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. 

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 3 + 1 = 4."
"To find out how many days Andy has to lose the weight, we need to count the days from December 31st to July 19th. 

December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days (since it's not a leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 19 days. 

31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 201 days

Now, we need to find out how many calories Andy needs to burn in total to lose 30 pounds. Since he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 calories to lose 30 pounds.

30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories

Now, we need to divide the total calories by the number of days to find out how many calories he needs to burn each day.

105,000 / 201 = 521 calories

So, Andy needs to have a calorie deficit of 521 calories each day to reach his goal."
"Gerald works 7 days a week. He earns $30 every day. So, he earns 7 x 30 = 210 dollars in a week. He spent 100 dollars. To find out how much he has left, we need to subtract the money he spent from the money he earned. 

210 - 100 = 110

So, Gerald has 110 dollars left."
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs, we need to know how many kilometers she will run. 

Since each lap is 0.25 km and she has to run 8 laps, we multiply 0.25 by 8.

0.25 km * 8 = 2 km

Now we know Hannah will run 2 kilometers. 

Since Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer, we multiply 60 by 2.

60 ml * 2 = 120 ml

So Hannah will need 120 milliliters of water."
"To find out how much money Julie spent on clothes, we need to calculate 20% of $500. 

20% of $500 is 0.2 x 500 = $100. 

So, Julie spent $100 on clothes. Now, we need to find out how much money she had left after buying clothes. 

$500 - $100 = $400.

Now, we need to find out how much money Julie spent on CDs. We need to calculate 25% of the remaining money, which is $400.

25% of $400 is 0.25 x 400 = $100.

So, Julie spent $100 on CDs. Now, we need to find out how much money she had left after buying CDs.

$400 - $100 = $300.

The final answer is: $300."
"Let's say the lot cost x dollars. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the house cost 3x dollars. 

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. So, we can write an equation: x + 3x = 120,000. 

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000. 

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000. 

Since the house cost 3x dollars, the house cost 3 * 30,000 = 90,000 dollars.

The house cost $90,000."
"To find the profit, we need to find out how much Tara spent on the canvas bags and how much she earned from selling them.

First, let's find out how much Tara spent on the canvas bags. She bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. So, she bought 8 * 5 = 40 canvas bags. The cost of 8 packs is 8 * $4 = $32.

Now, let's find out how much she earned from selling the canvas bags. She sold each bag for $8. So, she earned 40 * $8 = $320.

To find the profit, we need to subtract the cost from the earnings. Profit = Earnings - Cost = $320 - $32 = $288.

The final answer is: $288"
"To find out how many punches Joe threw, we need to know how many punches he threw per round and then multiply that by the number of rounds. 

First, we need to find out how many punches Joe throws in 3 minutes. Since he throws 25 punches per minute, we multiply 25 punches per minute by 3 minutes. 

25 punches/minute * 3 minutes = 75 punches

Since the fight lasts 5 rounds, we multiply the number of punches thrown in 3 minutes by 5.

75 punches * 5 rounds = 375 punches

The final answer is: 375"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. First, we need to find the total amount of money he has. 

4 $10 bills = 4 x $10 = $40
6 $20 bills = 6 x $20 = $120
Total money = $40 + $120 = $160

Ali gives his sister half of the total money. Half of $160 is $160 / 2 = $80. So, he gives his sister $80.

Now, Ali has $160 - $80 = $80 left.

He uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) x $80 = $48.

Now, we need to find out how much money Ali has left after buying dinner. He had $80 and spent $48 on dinner. So, he has $80 - $48 = $32 left.

The final answer is: $32"
"Let's break it down step by step.

Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house. We need to convert 2 hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so 2 hours is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes.

The problem says Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob to shingle a house. Double Rob's time is 2 x 120 = 240 minutes. 

Now, we add 40 minutes to double Rob's time to find Royce's time. 240 + 40 = 280 minutes.

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house."

"Let's break it down step by step:

- Chris starts with 100 math problems.
- On Monday, he completes 12 problems, so he has 100 - 12 = 88 problems left.
- On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 x 12 = 36 problems. So, he completes 36 problems on Tuesday, leaving him with 88 - 36 = 52 problems.
- On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems. So, he completes 13 problems on Wednesday, leaving him with 52 - 13 = 39 problems.

So, Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday.

"To find out how many quarts of strawberries each person can pick per hour, we need to know how many quarts Bobby, Kathy, and Ricky can pick per hour.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 5 * 2 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Now, we need to add up how many quarts of strawberries all of them can pick per hour. 
Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour, Bobby can pick 5 quarts per hour, Kathy can pick 10 quarts per hour, and Ricky can pick 8 quarts per hour.

"To find out how many rows of red tulips Jackson can plant, we need to divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row. 

36 (total red tulips) / 6 (tulips per row) = 6 rows of red tulips

To find out how many rows of blue tulips Jackson can plant, we need to divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

24 (total blue tulips) / 8 (tulips per row) = 3 rows of blue tulips

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips.

6 + 3 = 9

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins by the number of cups of raisins needed for each batch of cookies.

First, let's find out how many cups of raisins Heather will use for the granola and snack mix. Since she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, she will use 1/3 of the raisins for each.

Total raisins = 27 cups
Raisins for cookies = 3/4 cup per batch
Raisins for granola and snack mix = 1/3 of 27 cups = 9 cups

Now, let's find out how many cups of raisins are left for the cookies.
Raisins for cookies = Total raisins - Raisins for granola and snack mix
Raisins for cookies = 27 - 9
Raisins for cookies = 18 cups

Now, let's divide the raisins for cookies by the raisins needed per batch of cookies.
Number of batches = Raisins for cookies / Raisins per batch
Number of batches = 18 / (3/4)
To divide by a fraction, we multiply by the reciprocal of the fraction.
Number of batches = 18 * (4/3)
Number of batches = 72 / 3
Number of batches = 24

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to first find out how much she pays per week before and after adding the new device.

Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 7 days in a week, her weekly consumption is 12 * 7 = 84 kilowatts per hour.

The cost of 1 kilowatt per hour is $1.50. So, Ada's weekly bill before adding the new device is 84 * $1.50 = $126.

The new device will consume 2 kilowatts per hour a day. So, her new weekly consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour per day. Her new weekly consumption is 14 * 7 = 98 kilowatts per hour.

Her new weekly bill will be 98 * $1.50 = $147.

The difference in her weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21.

"If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, that means one person can paint a whole house in 10 days (since it takes twice as long to paint a whole house).

If one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, that means one person can paint a whole house in 10 x 24 = 240 hours (since there are 24 hours in a day).

If 5 people can paint a whole house in the same amount of time it takes one person, then it would still take 240 hours for 5 people to paint a whole house.

The answer is 240."
"Let's break it down step by step.

We know Ophelia has 20 sofas. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can say Jenna has x chairs and x - 2 sofas.

We also know Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Since Ophelia has 20 chairs, Jenna has 3 * 20 = 60 chairs.

Now we know Jenna has 60 chairs and x - 2 sofas. But we also know Jenna has 60 chairs, so we can say x = 60.

Now we can find the number of sofas Jenna has: x - 2 = 60 - 2 = 58.

So, Ophelia has 20 sofas and Jenna has 58 sofas. 

To find the total number of sofas, we add the number of sofas Ophelia and Jenna have: 20 + 58 = 78.

To find the total number of chairs, we add the number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have: 20 + 60 = 80.

The total number of sofas is 78."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set for some amount of money. In total, he paid $48. 

To find out how much the headphone set cost, we need to subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount he paid. 

$48 (total) - $4 (CD) = $44 (headphone set)

Now, we know the headphone set costs $44. If Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have had $44 more to spend on CDs. 

Since each CD costs $4, we can divide $44 by $4 to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought. 

$44 ÷ $4 = 11

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

The final answer is: 11"

6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

He worked out 5 hours for 2 weeks.
2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

He worked out 6 hours for 1 week.
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

"Let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 people get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus. So, 5 x 8 = 40 people get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is 40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80.

At the second stop, 21 people get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is 80 - 21 = 59.

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. This means 3 times 21 is 63, so 21 - 63 = -42 people get in. But you can't have a negative number of people getting in, so this means 0 people get in.

Now, the total number of people on the bus is 59 (left) + 0 (got in) = 59.

"Let's break this down step by step.

Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his age in 5 years will be 27. To find his current age, we need to subtract 5 from 27. 

Current age of Jame = 27 - 5 = 22

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. Let's first find Jame's age in 8 years. 

Jame's age in 8 years = 22 + 8 = 30

Now, we know that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can write an equation for this:

Cousin's age in 8 years = 2 * Jame's age in 8 years - 5
Cousin's age in 8 years = 2 * 30 - 5
Cousin's age in 8 years = 60 - 5
Cousin's age in 8 years = 55

Now, we know that Jame's cousin's age in 8 years is 55. To find the cousin's current age, we need to subtract 8 from 55.

Cousin's current age = 55 - 8
Cousin's current age = 47

Now, we know Jame's current age (22) and his cousin's current age (47). To find the difference in their ages, we subtract Jame's age from his cousin's age.

Difference in their ages = Cousin's current age - Jame's current age
Difference in their ages = 47 - 22
Difference in their ages = 25

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400. 

We also know the computer cost $1,100. 

Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.

To find the cost of the 2 monitors, we subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

Since there are 2 monitors, we divide the cost of the 2 monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor: $600 / 2 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that there are 20 kids in total, and they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. So, there are 10 girls and 10 boys.

The boys brought back 60 shells each, so the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 x 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 x 60 shells.

First, we multiply 4 and 60: 4 x 60 = 240.

Then, we add 600 and 240: 600 + 240 = 840.

So, the girls brought 840 shells in total. Since there are 10 girls, we need to divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by 10 to find out how many shells each girl brought.

840 ÷ 10 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's break it down step by step.

1. Nick had twice as many candies as George. 
2. Let's say George had x candies. Then Nick had 2x candies.
3. George ate 5 candies, so now George has x - 5 candies.
4. We know that George has 3 candies left, so x - 5 = 3.
5. To find out how many candies George had initially, we need to solve the equation x - 5 = 3.
6. Add 5 to both sides of the equation: x = 3 + 5
7. x = 8
8. Now we know that George had 8 candies initially.
9. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2x candies, which is 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

To find the thickness of the fourth book, we need to multiply the thickness of the first book by 2.

Thickness of the first book = 31 mm
Thickness of the fourth book = 31 mm * 2 = 62 mm

Now, we need to add the thickness of all four books to find the total thickness.

Thickness of the first book = 31 mm
Thickness of the second book = 50 mm

1. The eldest boy gets $18 shared among 3 boys, so he gets $18 / 3 = $6.

2. He added $5 to his share, so now he has $6 + $5 = $11.

3. He added another $10 the following day, so now he has $11 + $10 = $21.

4. He spent $8 from his total, so now he has $21 - $8 = $13.

5. He tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8, so now he has $13 * 3 = $39.

The final answer is: $39"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much Elvis saves in the first half of the month. Let's call the amount he saves in the first half ""x"". 

Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he will save 2x in the second half. 

The total amount he wants to save in the month is $1125. 

So, the equation will be: x + 2x = 1125

Combine like terms: 3x = 1125

Divide both sides by 3: x = 375

Now we know that Elvis saves $375 in the first half of the month. 

Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he will save 2 * 375 = 750 in the second half.

The final answer is: $750"
"To find out how much change Verna received, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought and subtract that from the $20 she gave.

First, let's calculate the cost of each type of fruit:

- 3 apples at $1.50 each: 3 x $1.50 = $4.50
- 5 oranges at $0.80 each: 5 x $0.80 = $4.00
- 6 peaches at $0.75 each: 6 x $0.75 = $4.50

Now, let's add up the cost of all the fruits: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Since Verna gave $20, we subtract the total cost from $20 to find the change: $20 - $13.00 = $7.00

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we need to find out how much money each of them gets and then subtract Jenny's money from Jairus's money.

Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, and he finished 20 tasks. So, Jairus gets 0.8 x 20 = $16.

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, and she finished 20 tasks. So, Jenny gets 0.5 x 20 = $10.

Now, we need to subtract Jenny's money from Jairus's money to find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny. 

Jairus's money - Jenny's money = $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars. 

We know that the total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation: x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms: 5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5: x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4x dollars, we multiply x by 4: 4x = 4 * 20 = 80

So, Jeff gets 80 dollars."
"To find out how many miles Jeff walks, we need to find out how many miles he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, he walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home, so he walks 3 + 3 = 6 miles each day.

He works 5 times a week, so we multiply 6 miles by 5 days: 6 * 5 = 30 miles.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice: 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters
2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once: 26 / 2 = 13 letters
3. So, the total number of letters written so far is 52 + 13 = 65 letters
4. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written: 65 letters * 2 = 130 letters

Now, we add the letters from the last step to the total: 65 + 130 = 195

The final answer is: 195"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
2. In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so there are 3 x 3 = 9 new families called.
   Total families called so far: 3 + 9 = 12
3. In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so there are 9 x 3 = 27 new families called.
   Total families called so far: 12 + 27 = 39
4. In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so there are 27 x 3 = 81 new families called.
   Total families called so far: 39 + 81 = 120

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to know how much weight he lost in total and then add that to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months. So, the total weight he lost is 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weight he lost to his final weight to find his initial weight. Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to figure out how many toys he needs in total and then subtract 2 from that number.

First, we need to find out how many toys Jonathan needs in total. Since James's play set has 80 toys and Jonathan needs a play set five times larger, we multiply 80 by 5.

80 * 5 = 400

So, Jonathan needs a total of 400 toys. Since he needs 2 more toys than he already has, we can say that the number of toys he currently has is 2 less than 400.

Let's call the number of toys Jonathan currently has ""x"". Then, x + 2 = 400.

To find x, we need to subtract 2 from both sides of the equation.

x + 2 - 2 = 400 - 2
x = 398

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the discount.

Cost of 1 calculator: $12
Cost of 1 geometry set: $10
Total cost before discount: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

Now, we need to apply the 10% discount. 
10% of $30 is 0.1 x $30 = $3
So, the discount is $3
Total cost after discount: $30 - $3 = $27

"To find out how much Antonella earned, we need to calculate her commission for the first $1000 and the additional commission for the sales over $1000.

For the first $1000, she earns a 30% commission. 
30% of $1000 is 0.3 x 1000 = $300.

For the sales over $1000, she earns an additional 10% commission. 
The sales over $1000 are $2500 - $1000 = $1500.
10% of $1500 is 0.1 x 1500 = $150.

Now, we add the commission for the first $1000 and the additional commission for the sales over $1000.
$300 + $150 = $450.

So, Antonella earned $450."

He wants 2 bottles for each of his 70 guests, so he needs 70 x 2 = 140 bottles. 

To find out how many more bottles he needs, we need to subtract the bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92.

The final answer is: 92"
"Let's break this down step by step.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long. Twice as long as 16 minutes is 2 x 16 = 32 minutes. 2 minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

So, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes when the water is warm.

To find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3. 16 x 3 = 48 minutes.

To find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a warm day, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3. 34 x 3 = 102 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day. We subtract the time it takes on a cold day from the time it takes on a hot day. 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. If the daily recommended cups of coffee is x, then Octavia drinks x/2 cups.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks. So, Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups of coffee.

Juan's doctor asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we need to subtract the recommended amount from the amount he currently drinks. 

So, the amount Juan must reduce is 5x - 4.

But we don't know the value of x. However, we can find the difference in terms of x. 

The difference is 5x - 4.

But we can also find the difference in terms of the number of cups Octavia drinks. Since Octavia drinks x/2 cups, we can say that the difference is 10 * (x/2) - 4 = 5x - 4.

However, we are not given the value of x. But we are given that Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. If we assume the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4, then Octavia drinks 4/2 = 2 cups.

So, x = 4.

Now we can find the difference. The difference is 5x - 4 = 5 * 4 - 4 = 20 - 4 = 16.

Initial angle of the pyramid = 32 degrees
Angle the sun moves per hour = 5 degrees
Number of hours the sun moves = 10 hours

Angle the sun moves in 10 hours = 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees
Final angle of the sun from the ground = Initial angle of the pyramid + Angle the sun moves in 10 hours

"To find out how many packs of candles James needs, we need to know how many candles he needs in total. Since one son is 12 and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old. 

For a 12-year-old, James will need 12 candles, and for an 8-year-old, he will need 8 candles. So, in total, he needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs. We can do this by dividing the total number of candles by the number of candles in a pack: 20 / 5 = 4. 

So, James needs 4 packs of candles. To find out how much he spends, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 4 * 3 = 12.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to multiply the number of minutes she read each night by the number of nights in a week. There are 7 nights in a week. 

15 minutes * 7 nights = 105 minutes

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we need to find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. 

105 minutes / 1.5 minutes = 70 intervals

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of pages she can read in each interval. 

70 intervals * 2 pages = 140 pages

In the second week, Judy read 100 pages.

"Let's break this down step by step.

Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. There are 7 days in a week. 

To find out how much he can spend each day, we need to divide the total amount of money he has ($70) by the number of days (7). 

$70 ÷ 7 = $10

So, Peter can spend $10 each day.

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. He spent 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday) buying these action figures. 

4 days * $10 per day = $40

Since each wooden action figure costs $5, we can find out how many he bought by dividing the total amount he spent ($40) by the cost of each action figure ($5).

$40 ÷ $5 = 8

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He has $30 left ($70 - $40 = $30). 

We can find out how many plastic action figures he can buy by dividing the remaining amount ($30) by the cost of each action figure ($2).

$30 ÷ $2 = 15

To find the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week, we add the number of wooden action figures (8) and the number of plastic action figures (15).

Ford grows 40 roses every week. There are 4 weeks in a month. So, Ford grows 40 * 4 = 160 roses in a month.

The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week, so in a month, they order 20 * 4 = 80 roses. 
The second flower shop orders 15 roses per week, so in a month, they order 15 * 4 = 60 roses. 
The third flower shop orders 30 roses per week, so in a month, they order 30 * 4 = 120 roses.

Now, we add up the roses ordered by all the flower shops: 80 + 60 + 120 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 160 roses in a month, but the flower shops order 260 roses. So, Ford lacks 260 - 160 = 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. So, the cost of bread for 1 sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30. 

The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00. So, the cost of cheese and condiments for 1 sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00.

The total cost for 1 sandwich is $0.30 (bread) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $3.30.

The revenue from selling 1 sandwich is $7.00.

The net profit for 1 sandwich is $7.00 (revenue) - $3.30 (cost) = $3.70.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. We need to convert the hours to minutes. 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 1 hour and 30 minutes is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We need to convert the hours to minutes. 2 hours is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes. So, 2 hours and 5 minutes is 120 + 5 = 125 minutes.

Now, we add the time of the first movie and the time of the second movie: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

The final answer is: 215"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price.

Herb's house price is $76,000. 
30% of $76,000 is 0.3 x $76,000 = $22,800.

Now, subtract $22,800 from $76,000 to find the price of Juan's house.
$76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

Now, we need to find the combined value of the two houses. 
Add Herb's house price and Juan's house price.
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200.

The final answer is: $129,200."
"Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 x 12 = 24 dishes. 

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 + 20 = 60 dishes. 

To find the total number of cups Judy brought, we add 12 + 24 = 36 cups. To find the total number of dishes Judy brought, we add 24 + 60 = 84 dishes. 

The total number of utensils brought by the two is 36 + 84 + 40 + 60 = 220. 

The final answer is: 220"
"To find out how many pairs of contacts Pete will need, we need to multiply the number of days he needs contacts by the number of pairs he uses per day. 

Pete needs contacts for 45 days and uses 1 pair per day, so he needs 45 pairs of contacts. 

Since he buys 2 boxes, he will have 2 * 90 = 180 pairs of contacts. 

He will have 180 - 45 = 135 extra pairs of contacts.

Since he only needs 45 pairs, we can ignore the extra pairs for now.

Each box is $100.00 and there is a 10% discount. 

10% of $100 is 0.1 * 100 = $10. 

So the discount is $10. 

The price of each box after the discount is $100 - $10 = $90.

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is 2 * $90 = $180.

To find the cost per pair, we need to divide the total cost by the number of pairs he needs. 

The cost per pair is $180 / 45 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To find out how much money Jill earned, we need to calculate her total hours worked. Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so she worked a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 x 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 x 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Jill earned $10 per hour, so she earned 3 x $10 = $30. John earned $10 per hour, so he earned 7 x $10 = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings. $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many calories Hannah burns in total, we need to add the calories she burns from aerobics and running. 

She burns 500 calories/hour for 2 hours of aerobics, so she burns 500 * 2 = 1000 calories from aerobics. 
She burns 600 calories/hour for 1 hour of running, so she burns 600 * 1 = 600 calories from running. 

Total calories burned = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink 100 ml of water. 

Total calories burned / 200 = 1600 / 200 = 8.

So, Hannah needs to drink 8 * 100 ml of water. 

8 * 100 = 800 ml."
"Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B. 

Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is B - 0.01B = 0.99B.

Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of green jelly beans is B + 0.01B = 1.01B.

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation: B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500.

Combine like terms: 3.00B = 4500.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 1500.

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans: 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1495.

And the number of green jelly beans: 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515.

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract: 1515 - 1495 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the average, we need to add up all the measurements and divide by 3. 

First, let's add up the measurements: 47 + 52 + (52 + 5) = 47 + 52 + 57 = 156

Now, let's divide the sum by 3: 156 / 3 = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. 
If he eats donuts every day for breakfast, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week.

To find the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks, we need to find out how much weight he'll lose or gain in 5 weeks with each option and then subtract the two amounts.

For Cheerios: 1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds
For donuts: 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

Now, let's find the difference: 
8.75 pounds (donuts) - 6.25 pounds (Cheerios) = 2.5 pounds

The final answer is: 2.5"
"To find out how many seats Alex will need, we need to calculate the total number of people coming to the event.

First, let's start with the people invited via email. Each of the 100 people invited will bring 2 friends, so that's 100 x 2 = 200 people. 

Then, Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them will bring their spouses, so that's 10 + 8 = 18 people.

Now, we add the people invited via email (200) and the people invited by phone (18) to get the total number of people coming to the event. 200 + 18 = 218.

So, Alex will need 218 seats."
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to find the weight of the Papillon first. 

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 x 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 x 5 = 220 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 220 pounds."
"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost on both websites and then subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay.

On Amazon, the total cost is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13 and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, so shipping costs $4 x 2 = $8. The total cost on eBay is $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping) = $21.

Now, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 (eBay) - $20 (Amazon) = $1.

The boots work out to be $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet. 

The beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles every day. 

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

Since 32 feet is taller than 20 feet, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how much protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find out how much protein is in 200 grams of mushrooms. 

We can do this by dividing 200 grams by 100 grams to find out how many cups of mushrooms John eats per day. 200 / 100 = 2 cups. 

Since 1 cup has 3 grams of protein, 2 cups will have 2 x 3 = 6 grams of protein. 

Now, we need to find out how much protein John gets per week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily protein by 7. 6 grams/day x 7 days = 42 grams. 

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break it down step by step.

Let Jerry's current age be x.

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can write an equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

To solve for x, we need to simplify the equation:

x = 2x - 10

Now, let's move the 2x to the left side of the equation:

x - 2x = -10

Combine like terms:

-x = -10

Multiply both sides by -1 to get rid of the negative sign:

x = 10

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown. 

The base price of one implant is $2000. Since George needs 2 implants, the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000. 

For one of the implants, George wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600. So, the amount he still needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour at work, to find out how many hours he needs to work to pay for the dental work, we need to divide the amount he still needs to pay ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15).

$3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's say the smallest angle is x. 

One angle is twice the smallest angle, so it's 2x. 
One angle is three times the smallest angle, so it's 3x.

The three angles add up to 180 degrees, so we can write an equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms: 6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30

Now we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees. 
One angle is twice the smallest angle, so it's 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees. 
One angle is three times the smallest angle, so it's 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. 

First, let's find the total value of the quarters: 8 quarters * 25 cents = 200 cents. 

Next, let's find the total value of the dimes: 6 dimes * 10 cents = 60 cents.

Then, let's find the total value of the nickels: 14 nickels * 5 cents = 70 cents.

Lastly, let's find the total value of the pennies: 15 pennies * 1 cent = 15 cents.

Now, let's add up the total value of all the coins: 200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert 345 cents to dollars by dividing by 100: 345 cents / 100 = 3.45 dollars.

Since each gumball costs a nickel (5 cents), we can find out how many gumballs Colby can buy by dividing the total amount of money he has by the cost of one gumball: 3.45 dollars * 100 cents/dollar / 5 cents/gumball = 69 gumballs.

The final answer is: 69"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to know how many legs each pet has. 

Dogs have 4 legs each, cats have 4 legs each, and birds have 2 legs each.

There are 5 dogs, so the total number of dog legs is 5 x 4 = 20.

There are 2 cats, so the total number of cat legs is 2 x 4 = 8.

There are 10 birds, so the total number of bird legs is 10 x 2 = 20.

Now, we add up all the legs: 20 (dog legs) + 8 (cat legs) + 20 (bird legs) = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the new weight Jamaal uses, we need to first find the weight after he increases the 8-pound weight by 50%. 

50% of 8 pounds is 8 x 0.5 = 4 pounds. 

So, the new weight is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds. 

Since he uses a weight two pounds lighter than that, we need to subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds. 

12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games for Christmas, so he gets 10 games in the first year. He also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so he buys 12 games. In total, he has 10 + 12 = 22 games at the end of the first year.

In the second year, Steve gets 5 games for Christmas, and he buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so he buys 24 games. In total, he has 22 + 5 + 24 = 51 games at the end of the second year.

In the third year, Steve gets 5 games for Christmas, and he buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so he buys 48 games. In total, he has 51 + 5 + 48 = 104 games at the end of the third year.

"To find out how many hours it would take to travel 2000 miles, we need to know the plane's speed. 

Speed is calculated by dividing the distance by the time. 

Distance = 1200 miles
Time = 3 hours

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Speed = 400 miles per hour

Now that we know the speed, we can find out how many hours it would take to travel 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it would take 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

"To find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to first find out how many pounds Ruiz makes in an hour. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how many pounds he makes in an hour, we divide 120 by 2. 

120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour for Ruiz.

Now, we know Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour. To find out how many pounds Marissa makes in an hour, we multiply 60 by 3/4.

60 * 3/4 = 45 pounds per hour for Marissa.

Now, we know how many pounds each person makes in an hour. We need to find out how many pounds they make in 12 hours. 

Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.

Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together. We add the pounds made by Ruiz and Marissa.

720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

He originally had $100, so he has $100 - $8 = $92 left.

On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as Monday, which is 2 x $8 = $16. 
So, he has $92 - $16 = $76 left.

On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as Tuesday, which is 4 x $16 = $64. 
So, he has $76 - $64 = $12 left.

"To find out how many times the tires rotate in a month, we need to multiply the number of miles driven in a month by the number of rotations per mile. 

Number of rotations per mile = 725
Number of miles driven in a month = 400

Total rotations in a month = 725 * 400 = 290,000

Now, we need to find out how many months the tire can last. 

Total rotations allowed = 10,440,000
Total rotations in a month = 290,000

Number of months the tire can last = Total rotations allowed / Total rotations in a month
= 10,440,000 / 290,000

"To find out how much each pump costs, we need to divide the total cost of the shampoo by the number of washings it can give and then multiply by the number of pumps used per wash.

First, we need to convert the cost to cents because the answer is asked in cents. $24.00 is equal to 2400 cents.

The shampoo can give 120 washings and Jackie uses 1 pump per wash. 

Now, we divide the total cost in cents by the number of washings: 2400 / 120 = 20 cents per wash.

Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the cost of each pump is 20 cents."
"To find out how much Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to first calculate the total cost of the outfit before the discount. 

The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35. 

Total cost before discount = $25 + $35 = $60

There is a 30% discount on the total cost. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 30% (or 0.3).

Discount amount = $60 * 0.3 = $18

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost.

Final cost = Total cost - Discount amount
Final cost = $60 - $18
Final cost = $42

Joe started with $50, so to find out how much he will have left, we subtract the final cost from the initial amount.

Amount left = Initial amount - Final cost
Amount left = $50 - $42
Amount left = $8

"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we need to first find out how many croissants he will make in a week. 

He wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day. 1 dozen is 12, so 4 dozen is 4 x 12 = 48 croissants a day. 

Since there are 7 days in a week, he will make 48 x 7 = 336 croissants in a week.

It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. 1 dozen is 12, so it takes 1/4 x 12 = 3 pounds of butter to make 12 croissants.

To find out how many pounds of butter he will need to make 336 croissants, we need to divide 336 by 12 (since 12 croissants take 3 pounds of butter). 336 / 12 = 28.

Now we need to multiply 28 by 3 (since 12 croissants take 3 pounds of butter). 28 x 3 = 84.

So, Juan will need 84 pounds of butter to make 336 croissants.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how much it costs to repave Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of his street. 

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Cost to repave Lewis' street = Cost per meter * Length of Lewis' street
Cost to repave Lewis' street = $194 * 490
Cost to repave Lewis' street = $95,060

Now, we need to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street. 

Length of Monica's street: 150 meters
Cost to repave Monica's street = Cost per meter * Length of Monica's street
Cost to repave Monica's street = $194 * 150
Cost to repave Monica's street = $29,100

Now, we subtract the cost to repave Monica's street from the cost to repave Lewis' street to find the difference.

Difference = Cost to repave Lewis' street - Cost to repave Monica's street
Difference = $95,060 - $29,100

"To find the total cost of John's research, we need to calculate the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 45 months.

The initial funding for the first 5 months is $100,000.

For the remaining 45 months, the funding is 50% more than the initial funding. 50% of $100,000 is $50,000. So, the funding for the remaining 45 months is $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000 per month.

To find the total cost for the remaining 45 months, we multiply the monthly funding by the number of months: $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

Now, we add the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 45 months: $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

The total cost of John's research is $6,850,000.

Since we can't have a negative number of street lights, it seems like there's an error in the problem. However, I will provide the answer as per the given information.

Total number of functioning street lights: -4"
"To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played, we need to add the number of times each DVD has been played so far and then subtract that from the total number of times each DVD can be played.

The first DVD has been played 356 times and can be played 1000 times in total. So, it can be played 1000 - 356 = 644 more times.

The second DVD has been played 135 times and can be played 1000 times in total. So, it can be played 1000 - 135 = 865 more times.

Now, we add the number of times each DVD can be played: 644 + 865 = 1509.

So, both DVDs can be played 1509 times before they break."
"To find the total cost of the physical therapy, we need to calculate the total number of hours John went to physical therapy and then multiply it by the cost per hour.

John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks. Each week, he went twice for 2 hours at a time. So, the total number of hours he went to physical therapy is:
6 weeks * 2 sessions per week * 2 hours per session = 24 hours

Now, we multiply the total number of hours by the cost per hour:
24 hours * $125 per hour = $3000

The final answer is: $3000"
"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim chews at school, we need to divide the total school hours by 2. 

8 hours / 2 = 4 pieces of gum

He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces. 

4 (at school) + 2 (on the way home and after dinner) = 6 pieces of gum

He has 20 pieces initially and gives half to his sister. Half of 20 is 10. 

20 - 10 = 10

So, Jim has 10 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

"To find out how much the baseball coach spent, we multiply the number of baseballs by the price of each baseball. 

9 baseballs * $3 = $27

To find out how much the basketball coach spent, we multiply the number of basketballs by the price of each basketball.

8 basketballs * $14 = $112

Now, we need to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach. We do this by subtracting the amount the baseball coach spent from the amount the basketball coach spent.

$112 - $27 = $85

The final answer is: $85"
"To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we need to find out how many flowers are in the garden and then multiply it by 4/5.

First, let's find out how many flowers are in the garden. There are 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row. 

10 rows * 20 flowers per row = 200 flowers

Now, we need to multiply 200 flowers by 4/5 to find out how many flowers have bloomed.

200 * 4/5 = 200 * 4 / 5 = 800 / 5 = 160

So, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s. 

1 Mb = 1000 kb
So, 1 kb = 1/1000 Mb

Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kb/s. To convert it to Mb/s, we multiply 20 by 1/1000.

20 kb/s * (1/1000) = 0.02 Mb/s

Now, we need to find out how many seconds are in an hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour.

60 minutes * 60 seconds = 3600 seconds in an hour

Now, we multiply Ashley's speed in Mb/s by the number of seconds in an hour to get her speed in Mb/h.

0.02 Mb/s * 3600 s = 72 Mb/h

The final answer is: 72"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

The tow truck pulled 10 cars for each of the first three days. So, the total number of cars it pulled in the first three days is 10 x 3 = 30.

The remaining days in the week are 7 - 3 = 4 days. On each of these days, it pulled 10 - 4 = 6 cars.

The total number of cars it pulled on the remaining 4 days is 6 x 4 = 24.

Now, we add the total number of cars it pulled in the first three days and the remaining 4 days. 
Total number of cars = 30 + 24 = 54.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to subtract his current height from the height required to ride it and then divide by the rate at which he grows.

Height required to ride the roller coaster: 4 feet = 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches)
Adam's current height: 40 inches
Growth rate: 2 inches per year

First, let's find out how much more Adam needs to grow: 
48 inches (required height) - 40 inches (current height) = 8 inches

Now, let's divide the amount he needs to grow by his growth rate:
8 inches / 2 inches per year = 4 years

So, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how much James sold the cars for. Since he sold 10 cars for $25,000 each, we multiply 10 by $25,000.

10 x $25,000 = $250,000

2. Next, we need to find out how much the company paid to acquire the cars. The company paid 30% of the price, so we need to find 30% of $250,000.

30% of $250,000 = 0.3 x $250,000 = $75,000

3. Now, we need to find out how much James made from selling the cars. We subtract the amount the company paid from the selling price.

$250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

4. Finally, we need to find out how much James made from his commission. He got a 10% commission on the profits, so we need to find 10% of $175,000.

10% of $175,000 = 0.1 x $175,000 = $17,500

So, James made $17,500."
"To find out how many riders can stay upright, we need to find 25% of 100. 

25% of 100 is 0.25 x 100 = 25.

Now, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find out how many women are riding, we need to find 60% of 25.

60% of 25 is 0.6 x 25 = 15.

Since there are 25 riders in total who can stay upright, and 15 of them are women, the number of men who can stay upright is 25 - 15 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The price of a diamond Jewell is $2000.
2. The price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond Jewell. 
   To find the price of a gold Jewell, we multiply the price of a diamond Jewell by 4/5.
   Price of gold Jewell = (4/5) * $2000 = $1600
3. The cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold.
   To find the price of a silver Jewell, we subtract $400 from the price of a gold Jewell.
   Price of silver Jewell = $1600 - $400 = $1200
4. To find the total price for all three jewels, we add the prices of a diamond, gold, and silver Jewell.
   Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"Let's break it down step by step.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. 
He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.
He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps together: 
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to find the time it takes for the distance between them to be zero.

First, we need to find the relative speed between Tom and Bob. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract their speeds: 55 mph (Bob's speed) - 70 mph (Tom's speed) = -15 mph. The negative sign means that Tom is actually getting closer to Bob.

However, we can ignore the negative sign because we are only interested in the rate at which Tom is closing the gap. So, the relative speed is 15 mph.

Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. The distance is 75 miles (the initial gap between them).

time = 75 miles / 15 mph
time = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"Let's break it down step by step.

We know Naomi caught 17 fish. Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so Darren caught 17 - 6 = 11 fish.

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss, we need to find out how much he can spend per class. If his parents won't sign him up again if the classes cost more than $10 per class, then the total cost of the classes should be less than or equal to $10 * 10 = $100.

Manny signed up for 10 classes for $60. This means that the cost per class is $60 / 10 = $6 per class.

Since his parents won't sign him up again if the classes cost more than $10 per class, Manny can miss classes as long as the cost per class is less than or equal to $10. 

So, if Manny misses x classes, the cost per class will be $60 / (10 - x). This should be less than or equal to $10.

$60 / (10 - x) <= $10

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (10 - x):

$60 <= $10 * (10 - x)

$60 <= $100 - $10x

$60 + $10x <= $100

$10x <= $40

x <= $40 / $10

x <= 4

So, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 4"
"If Jewel processes 50 customers a day, and Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, then Julie processes 2 x 50 = 100 customers a day.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total number of customers processed by Jewel in a week is 50 x 7 = 350.

The total number of customers processed by Julie in a week is 100 x 7 = 700.

The total weekly production for the two is 350 + 700 = 1050.

"To find out how much Clyde will pay, we need to first find the cost of one apple and one orange. 

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the cost of 1 apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30. 

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of 1 orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we need to find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges. 
The cost of 5 apples is 5 x $1.30 = $6.50.
The cost of 5 oranges is 5 x $1.10 = $5.50.

So, the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

"To find the time it takes to dig the hole, we need to find the volume of the hole first. The formula for volume is length x width x height. 

Length = 6 feet
Width = 4 feet
Height = 3 feet

Volume = length x width x height
Volume = 6 x 4 x 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3 seconds.

Time = Volume x 3 seconds
Time = 72 x 3
Time = 216 seconds

The final answer is: 216"
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add up the base price and the cost of the extra features.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so we need to divide $7,500 by 3 to find the cost of the leather seats. 
$7,500 / 3 = $2,500

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so we need to subtract $500 from the cost of the leather seats to find the cost of the running boards.
$2,500 - $500 = $2,000

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, we need to add up the base price and the cost of the extra features:
$30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To find out how much Tim will make in a year, we need to first find out his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's find out his new monthly salary. He gets a 5% raise on his $20000 a month salary. 

5% of $20000 is 0.05 x $20000 = $1000. 

So, his new monthly salary is $20000 + $1000 = $21000.

He also gets a bonus worth half a month's salary. Half of $21000 is $21000 / 2 = $10500.

So, his total monthly income is $21000 + $10500 = $31500.

Now, let's multiply his total monthly income by 12 to find out how much he will make in a year.

$31500 x 12 = $378000.

"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to find out how long it takes him to dig through the soil and the clay separately, and then add those times together.

First, let's find out how long it takes him to dig through the soil. He can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, and he has to dig 24 feet of soil. 

Time to dig through soil = Total feet of soil / Feet dug per hour
Time to dig through soil = 24 / 4
Time to dig through soil = 6 hours

Now, let's find out how long it takes him to dig through the clay. He can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil, so he can dig 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour through clay. He has to dig 8 feet of clay.

Time to dig through clay = Total feet of clay / Feet dug per hour
Time to dig through clay = 8 / 2
Time to dig through clay = 4 hours

"Let's break it down step by step.

In the first month, Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400, and it's half of the total amount she earned from selling green hats. 

Let's say the total sales from green hats in the first month is x. Then, the sales from red hats is half of x, which is x/2. We know that x/2 is $400. 

To find x, we can multiply both sides by 2: 
x = 2 * 400
x = 800

So, the total sales from green hats in the first month is $800.

Now, the total sales in the first month is the sum of sales from red and green hats:
Total sales in the first month = $400 + $800 = $1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. 
To find the sales in the second month, we can multiply the total sales in the first month by 3/4:
Sales in the second month = 3/4 * $1200
Sales in the second month = $900

The total amount she made in two months is the sum of sales in the first and second months:
Total amount = $1200 + $900 = $2100

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the plane, the cost of renting the hanger, and the cost of fuel.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The cost of renting the hanger is $5000 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost of renting the hanger for a year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The cost of fuel is twice as much as the cost of renting the hanger, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total cost of fuel for a year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, we add up the cost of the plane, the cost of renting the hanger, and the cost of fuel to find the total cost.

Total cost = cost of plane + cost of renting hanger + cost of fuel

"Let's say the number of sheep is S and the number of geese is G. 

We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. 

The total number of legs is 70, so we can write an equation: 4S + 2G = 70.

We also know that the total number of heads is 20, and each animal has one head. So, the total number of heads is the sum of the number of sheep and geese: S + G = 20.

Now we have two equations:

1) 4S + 2G = 70
2) S + G = 20

We can solve the second equation for G: G = 20 - S.

Now we can substitute G in the first equation: 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

Expanding the equation: 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

Combine like terms: 2S + 40 = 70.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 2S = 30.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how much the more expensive brand of coffee costs, we need to find 20% of the normal price and add it to the normal price. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 x 5 = $1. 
So the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he needs 7 pounds for a week. 
7 pounds of the more expensive brand will cost 7 x $6 = $42.

He also bought a donut for $2. 
So the total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To find out how much the apple pie cost, we need to subtract the total cost of the items Gus bought from the $20.00 he spent. 

First, let's add up the cost of the items Gus bought: 
2 bags of chips for $2.00 each is 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Adding the cost of the bucket of fried chicken, $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00
Adding the cost of the bottle of soda, $12.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the items Gus bought from the $20.00 he spent: 
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers he delivers to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers he delivers.

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
= 600 - (198 + 209)
= 600 - 407
= 193

The final answer is: 193"
"To find out how many recipes John learns, we need to find out how many hours of class time he has in total. 

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so that's 4 x 2 = 8 hours per week. 

Since the class is for 6 weeks, we multiply the hours per week by the number of weeks: 8 hours/week x 6 weeks = 48 hours.

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total hours by 1.5: 48 hours / 1.5 hours/recipe = 32 recipes.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of math teachers, we need to find the number of history teachers first. Since 60% of the teachers are history teachers, we can find 60% of 150.

60% of 150 = 0.6 x 150 = 90

So, there are 90 history teachers. To find the number of math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers.

Number of math teachers = Total number of teachers - Number of history teachers
= 150 - 90
= 60

Now, we know that each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours they sleep per day.

Total time math teachers sleep = Number of math teachers x Hours they sleep per day
= 60 x 6
= 360

The final answer is: 360"
"Let's break it down step by step.

Aurelia has $120.

Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia. 
3/4 * 120 = 90
So, Kassidy has $90.

Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. 
90 + 60 = 150
So, Rayna has $150.

Now, let's add their money together: 
120 + 90 + 150 = 360

If they share this money equally among them, we need to divide 360 by 3 (the number of people).
360 / 3 = 120

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the total time of the game, we need to add the time of the 4 quarters and the extra 5 minutes.

Each quarter is 12 minutes long, so 4 quarters will be 4 x 12 = 48 minutes.

Then we add the extra 5 minutes to the 48 minutes. 48 + 5 = 53 minutes.

So the entire game lasted 53 minutes."
"To find out how many employees are management, we need to find 20% of 50. 

20% of 50 is 0.2 x 50 = 10. 

So, 10 employees are management. 

Now, we need to find out how many of these 10 employees oversee the company. We are told that 30% of the management employees oversee the company. 

30% of 10 is 0.3 x 10 = 3.

So, 3 employees oversee the company.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many tablespoons of dry ingredients Svetlana would need, we need to find out how many tablespoons of flour, sugar, and salt she needs for 16 muffins. 

For flour, she needs 5 tablespoons per muffin, so for 16 muffins, she would need 5 x 16 = 80 tablespoons of flour.

For sugar, she needs 3 tablespoons per muffin, so for 16 muffins, she would need 3 x 16 = 48 tablespoons of sugar.

For salt, she needs 0.25 tablespoons per muffin, so for 16 muffins, she would need 0.25 x 16 = 4 tablespoons of salt.

Now, we need to add the total amount of flour, sugar, and salt to find the total amount of dry ingredients. 

80 (flour) + 48 (sugar) + 4 (salt) = 132

The final answer is: 132"
"To find out how much candy each of them will have, we need to add up all the candy they have and then divide it by the number of people.

Robert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy. 

First, we add up all the candy: 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds.

There are 3 people, so we divide the total candy by 3: 12 / 3 = 4.

So each of them will have 4 pounds of candy."
"To find out how much change Adam got, we need to first find out how much he paid for the candies. 

The cost of 7 candies of type A is 7 x $0.5 = $3.5. 
The cost of 10 candies of type B is 10 x $0.75 = $7.5. 
So, the total cost of the candies is $3.5 + $7.5 = $11. 

Since Adam paid the cashier $15, the change he got is $15 - $11 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"Let's break down the information given:

- First 8 days: Good
- Next 8 days: Bad
- Next 8 days: Neutral
- Next 3 days: Good, Neutral, Good

We know that Christina had 12 good days in total. We already know that the first 8 days and the last 3 days were good, which is 8 + 3 = 11 good days. 

Since Christina had 12 good days in total, and we already know 11 of them, there must be 1 more good day left in the month.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This means if Sally has x books, Janey has 2x + 3 books. 

We know Janey has 21 books. So, we can set up the equation: 2x + 3 = 21.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 21 - 3. 

2x = 18

Now, we need to divide both sides by 2 to find the value of x: x = 18 / 2.

x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books. 

9"
"To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches, we need to know how many inches it is now and how many inches it grows per day. 

The bamboo is currently 20 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 20 feet to inches by multiplying 20 by 12. 

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now we know the bamboo is 240 inches tall. We also know it grows 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches, we need to subtract the current height from the target height and then divide by the growth rate.

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Now we divide 360 inches by 30 inches/day to find the number of days.

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. 
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs 8 more toys for these dogs. 
   Now, James has 4 (initial toys) + 8 (new toys) = 12 toys for 12 dogs.
3. When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, so there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs.
   James needs 16 more toys for these dogs. 
   Now, James has 12 (previous toys) + 16 (new toys) = 28 toys for 28 dogs.
4. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. 
   James still has 28 toys for 25 dogs.

To find the total number of toys James needs, we need to subtract the 3 toys he no longer needs from the total number of toys he has. 
28 (total toys) - 3 (toys no longer needed) = 25 toys.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break it down step by step.

First, Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is 2/5 * $1200 = $480.

Now, the remaining amount is $1200 - $480 = $720.

Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is 2/3 * $720 = $480.

Now, the remaining amount is $720 - $480 = $240.

100 - 64 = 36 signatures

They need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To find out how much Karen earns in a day, we need to multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works in a day. 

Karen's hourly wage is twice Lorie's, and Lorie earns $10 per hour. So, Karen earns 2 x $10 = $20 per hour.

Now, we multiply Karen's hourly wage by the number of hours she works in a day: $20 per hour * 3 hours per day = $60 per day.

To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we multiply her daily wage by 2: $60 per day * 2 days = $120.

"To find out how many hash browns we can make from 96 potatoes, we need to know the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

We know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. 

To find the ratio, we divide the number of hash browns by the number of potatoes: 36 hash browns / 6 potatoes = 6 hash browns per potato.

Now, we multiply the number of potatoes we have (96) by the number of hash browns per potato (6): 96 potatoes * 6 hash browns/potato = 576 hash browns.

The answer is 576."
"To find out how much they will exceed the maximum load, we need to find the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults, and then subtract the maximum load of the elevator.

First, we need to find the total weight of the 8 adults. Since each adult weighs 80 kg, we multiply 8 by 80.

8 x 80 = 640 kg

Now, we add Jack's weight to the total weight of the 8 adults. Since we don't know Jack's weight, let's assume he weighs 80 kg like the other adults.

640 + 80 = 720 kg

Now, we subtract the maximum load of the elevator from the total weight of Jack and the 8 adults.

720 - 700 = 20 kg

So, they will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, but we don't know how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. Let's call the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has ""x"". So, Max has x + 12 cookies.
4. We already know Max has 73 cookies, so x + 12 = 73. To find x, we subtract 12 from both sides: x = 73 - 12 = 61. The Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.
5. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, and Max has 73 cookies. So, Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.
6. To find the total number of cookies, we add the number of cookies each person has: Katarina (68) + Max (73) + Cookie Monster (61) + Summer (96) = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298.

The final answer is: 298"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that the final length of the dress is 140cm. We also know that 20cm of that is the lace trim at the bottom. So, the original length of the dress before adding the lace trim is 140 - 20 = 120cm.

Now, we know that Shania extended the dress by 50% of its original length. Let's call the original length 'x'. Then, 50% of 'x' is 0.5x. So, the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

We know that the new length is 120cm. So, 1.5x = 120.

To find 'x', we need to divide both sides by 1.5. 

x = 120 / 1.5
x = 80

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find out how long it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to find the time it took him to mow half the lawn in each mode and then add them together.

First, let's find the time it took him to mow half the lawn in turtle mode. Since it takes him 1 hour to mow the whole lawn in turtle mode, it will take him 1/2 hour to mow half the lawn in turtle mode. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 1/2 hour is 60/2 = 30 minutes.

Next, let's find the time it took him to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode. It takes him 40 minutes to mow the whole lawn in rabbit mode, so it will take him 40/2 = 20 minutes to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode.

Now, we add the time it took him to mow half the lawn in each mode: 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Let's say the age of the triplet is x. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the other twin's age will be x + 7. 

We have one triplet and two twins, so the total number of people is 3. Their combined ages are 44. 

We can write an equation to represent this: x + (x + 7) + x = 44

Combine like terms: 3x + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 37

Divide both sides by 3: x = 12.33

Since the triplet's age is 12.33, the other twin's age will be 12.33 + 7 = 19.33

But we can't have a fraction of a year, so we'll round down to the nearest whole number. 

One of the twins is 19 years old."

20 minutes of math homework + 40 minutes of reading homework + 20 minutes of history homework = 80 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the time John has to spend on his homework from the total time he has before dinner. 
180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes.

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find out how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost, we need to first find out how much 10 lollipops and 4 candies cost, and then add the cost of 6 more candies.

First, let's find out how much 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost. We know that 5 lollipops cost 5 x $0.40 = $2.00. We also know that 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20. So, the cost of 4 candies is $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20.

Now, we know that 4 candies cost $1.20, so 1 candy costs $1.20 / 4 = $0.30. 

Now, we know that 1 candy costs $0.30, so 10 candies will cost 10 x $0.30 = $3.00.

We also know that 5 lollipops cost $2.00, so 10 lollipops will cost 10 x $0.40 = $4.00.

Now, we know that 10 lollipops cost $4.00 and 10 candies cost $3.00, so 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"Let's break it down step by step.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so we need to find 2/5 of 20. 
2/5 of 20 is 8. 
So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins every month.

Now, let's find out how many months are in 10 years. 
There are 12 months in a year, so 10 years will have 10 x 12 = 120 months.

Rong saves 20 coins every month, so in 120 months, he will save 20 x 120 = 2400 coins.

Neil saves 28 coins every month, so in 120 months, he will save 28 x 120 = 3360 coins.

Now, let's add the total coins saved by Rong and Neil. 
2400 + 3360 = 5760

"To find the total bill, we need to add the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

First, we find the total cost of the vaccines: 2 vaccines * $20 each = 2 * 20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill ""x"". Then, 60% of x is 0.6x. We know that 0.6x + $40 = x (because the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, and the total bill is the sum of the heartworm check and the vaccines).

Now, we need to solve for x. Subtract 0.6x from both sides of the equation: $40 = 0.4x. 

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: $40 / 0.4 = x. This gives us x = $100.

So, the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * 100 = $60. 

The total bill is $100, and the heartworm check is $60. So, the cost of the vaccines is $100 - $60 = $40.

John brought $125 with him. He pays $100 for the total bill and $40 for the vaccines. So, he pays a total of $100 + $40 = $140.

To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total amount he paid from the amount he brought: $125 - $140 = -$15. 

However, since you can't leave with a negative amount of money, this means John doesn't have enough money to pay for the total bill. 

But if we assume he pays the $100 for the total bill and the $60 for the heartworm check, he will have $125 - $100 - $60 = -$35. 

But if we assume he pays the $100 for the total bill and the $40 for the vaccines, he will have $125 - $100 - $40 = -$15.

But if we assume he pays the $60 for the heartworm check and the $40 for the vaccines, he will have $125 - $60 - $40 = $25.

So, the final answer is $25."

"Let's break it down step by step:

- The comforter has 14 red squares.
- It has 4 more blue squares than red squares, so it has 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.
- It has 6 more green squares than blue squares, so it has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.
- It has 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so it has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, let's add up the total number of squares: 
14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"To find out how many regular chairs the restaurant has, we need to multiply the number of high chairs by 5. 

8 high chairs * 5 = 40 regular chairs

Now, we need to find out how many chairs are needed in total. There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so we need to add them together.

42 adults + 15 babies = 57 people

Since each person needs a chair, we need 57 chairs in total. 

Now, we need to find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get. We already have 8 high chairs and 40 regular chairs, so we need to add them together.

8 high chairs + 40 regular chairs = 48 chairs

Now, let's add up the points of all the students:
Adam = 50 points
Betty = 65 points
Tom = 35 points
Marta = 105 points

20 people * 2 drinks/person = 40 drinks
20 people * 3 snacks/person = 60 snacks

Now, we need to find the total number of items (drinks and snacks) to multiply by the cost per item.

40 drinks + 60 snacks = 100 items

Each item costs $2, so we multiply the total number of items by the cost per item.

100 items * $2/item = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, which can haul 4,000 pounds. So, Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, we know that when Gary joins Gissela and Gordy, the three trucks can haul a total of 11,600 pounds. We already know that Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can haul 4,800 pounds. 

So, the total weight that Gissela and Gordy's trucks can haul is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds. 

Now, we need to find out how much Gary's truck can haul. We know that the total weight that all three trucks can haul is 11,600 pounds. So, Gary's truck can haul 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

The final answer is: 2800"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know there are 8 males and 6 females. So, the total number of people is 8 + 6 = 14.

Each female ate 3 dumplings, and there are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 x 3 = 18.

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 x 4 = 32.

The total number of dumplings eaten is 18 (by females) + 32 (by males) = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much money Gerald had, we need to first find out how much he got from the $100. 

The ratio of the money Gerald and Julia got is 3:2. This means that for every 3 parts Gerald gets, Julia gets 2 parts. The total parts are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Since Gerald got 3 parts, we can find out how much 1 part is by dividing $100 by 5. 

$100 / 5 = $20

Since Gerald got 3 parts, we multiply 3 by $20 to find out how much he got.

3 x $20 = $60

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we need to subtract $10 from $60 to find out how much he has left.

$60 - $10 = $50

The final answer is: $50"
"If Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle, that means the turtle is 1/5 as fast as the cat. 

Since the cat can run 15 feet/second, the turtle can crawl 15/5 feet/second. 

15/5 = 3 feet/second. 

To find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply 3 feet/second by 40 seconds.

3 * 40 = 120 feet.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many hours they have to fundraise, we need to know how much they need to raise in total and how much they have already raised. 

They need to raise $6300 in total and they have already raised $2100. 

To find out how much more they need to raise, we subtract the amount they have already raised from the total amount they need to raise: 

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Now, we know they need to raise $4200 more. They are raising an equal amount every hour, so we can divide the amount they need to raise by the number of hours they have already worked to find out how much they raise per hour. 

They have already worked for 3 hours, so we divide $4200 by 3: 

$4200 / 3 = $1400

Now we know they raise $1400 per hour. To find out how many hours they need to work to raise $4200, we divide the amount they need to raise by the amount they raise per hour: 

$4200 / $1400 = 3

So they have already worked for 3 hours and they need to work 3 more hours to reach their goal. 

3 + 3 = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percent of the river's total water used by the city. 

The city uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. 

Then, 80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes. To find 80% of 40%, we multiply 40% by 0.8 (since 80% is the same as 80/100 or 0.8). 

40% * 0.8 = 0.4 or 32%

So, 32% of the river's total water is used by the city for industrial purposes. 

To find the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percent used for industrial purposes from the total percent used by the city. 

40% - 32% = 8%

"To find the total quarts made in 48 hours, we need to find out how many quarts the factory makes in one hour and then multiply it by 48.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find out how many quarts it makes in one hour, we divide 100 by 2. 

100 / 2 = 50 quarts of chocolate ice cream per hour.

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find out how many quarts it makes in one hour, we divide 50 by 4.

50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts of vanilla ice cream per hour.

Now, we add the quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream made per hour to find the total quarts made per hour.

50 (chocolate) + 12.5 (vanilla) = 62.5 quarts per hour.

To find the total quarts made in 48 hours, we multiply 62.5 by 48.

62.5 * 48 = 3000

The final answer is: 3000"
"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each will be 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
3 mini quiches at $4.00 each will be 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each will be 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, we add the costs together: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus gets a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount, we multiply the total by 0.10: $50.00 x 0.10 = $5.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To find out how many scoops Erin can buy, we need to first find out how much she can spend. Erin has $6.00. 

Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy. 

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4

So Erin can buy 4 scoops of ice cream. But the deal is buy 2 scoops get 1 free, so we need to find out how many sets of 3 scoops she can buy. 

We can divide 4 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 scoops she can buy. 

4 ÷ 3 = 1 with a remainder of 1. 

So Erin can buy 1 set of 3 scoops and 1 extra scoop. 

1 set of 3 scoops is 3 scoops, and 1 extra scoop is 1 scoop. 

3 + 1 = 4

So Erin should buy 4 scoops of ice cream.

There are 7 days in a week, so two weeks have 7 x 2 = 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 x 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 x 14 = 42 pieces.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger, we need to subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount of candy Amy has. 

58 - 44 = 14

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger."

First, we need to find out how many slices Bryce and two friends ate. There are 6 people in total, and 4 of them ate 2/3 of their pizzas. So, 4 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas. 

4 people * 2/3 = 8/3

Since each pizza has 12 slices, we need to multiply 8/3 by 12 to find out how many slices they ate. 

8/3 * 12 = 32 slices

Now, we need to find out how many slices the two remaining friends ate. They ate ¾ of their pizzas. 

2 people * 3/4 = 6/4 or 1.5

Since each pizza has 12 slices, we need to multiply 1.5 by 12 to find out how many slices they ate. 

1.5 * 12 = 18 slices

Now, we need to add the slices eaten by Bryce and his friends and the slices eaten by the two remaining friends. 

32 + 18 = 50 slices

Since there are 6 people in total and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 6 * 12 = 72 slices.

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe into inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet into inches by multiplying 8 by 12. 

8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches

Now, we add 4 inches to the result to get the total length of Topher's shoe in inches.

96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We can write this as an equation:

Length of Topher's shoe = 9 * Length of Bobby's shoe + 10

We can plug in the value of Topher's shoe length into the equation:

100 = 9 * Length of Bobby's shoe + 10

Now, we can solve for the length of Bobby's shoe by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

100 - 10 = 9 * Length of Bobby's shoe
90 = 9 * Length of Bobby's shoe

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9 to find the length of Bobby's shoe:

90 / 9 = Length of Bobby's shoe
10 = Length of Bobby's shoe

"To find out how many windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the total number of windows she smashes from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find out how many windows she smashes from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each. A quarter of the students' cars' windows are smashed. A quarter of 64 is 64 / 4 = 16. So, 16 students' cars' windows are smashed. Since each car has 4 windows, the total number of windows smashed from students' cars is 16 * 4 = 64.

Next, let's find out how many windows she smashes from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each. Three-fourths of the teachers' cars' windows are smashed. Three-fourths of 32 is 32 * (3/4) = 24. So, 24 teachers' cars' windows are smashed. Since each car has 2 windows, the total number of windows smashed from teachers' cars is 24 * 2 = 48.

Now, let's add the total number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars. 64 (students' cars) + 48 (teachers' cars) = 112.

Since there are 50 students in total, and 15 like to bake or play basketball, the number of students who like to play video games or play music is 50 - 15 = 35.

We also know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. So, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we know that the total number of students who like to play video games or play music is 35, and the number of students who like to play music is 10. So, the number of students who like to play video games is 35 - 10 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many birds were scared away, we need to find 1/3 of 12. 

1/3 of 12 is 12 / 3 = 4. 

So, 4 birds were scared away. 

Now, we need to find out how many birds are left. 
12 - 4 = 8 birds are left.

Then, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. 
8 + 20 = 28 birds.

The final answer is: 28"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

We know that there are 80 students in total and that each class has the same number of students. Let's call the number of students in each class ""x"". Since there are two classes, the total number of students is 2x. We know that 2x = 80.

To find the number of students in each class, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2. 

2x / 2 = 80 / 2
x = 40

So, each class has 40 students.

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we need to multiply the total number of students in each class by 40% (or 0.4).

Number of girls in each class = 40 * 0.4
= 16

Since there are 40 students in each class and 16 are girls, the number of boys in each class is 40 - 16 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"Mara started with 2 slices of cake. 
She added 3 more slices, so she had 2 + 3 = 5 slices. 
She tripled the number of slices, so she had 5 * 3 = 15 slices. 
She ate 2 slices, so she had 15 - 2 = 13 slices. 
Her friend stole 5 slices, so she had 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we need to add up all the animals and then divide by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

First, let's add up all the animals:
8 (dogs) + 5 (cats) + 3 (birds) + 12 (horses) = 28 animals

Now, let's divide the total number of animals by 7:
28 / 7 = 4

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

"To find the profit, we need to first find the total cost and the total value of the cards.

The total cost is 3 packs * $1800 = $5400.

The total value of the cards is $4000 + $1000 + (30 * $50) = $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

The profit is the total value of the cards - the total cost = $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

The final answer is: $1100"
"To find out how much they will save, we need to calculate the cost of both amusement parks and then subtract the cost of the second amusement park from the cost of the first amusement park.

For the first amusement park, the cost is:
2 adults * $26 = $52
2 children * $12 = $24
Total cost for the first amusement park = $52 + $24 = $76

For the second amusement park, the cost is:
2 adults * $14 = $28
2 children * $10 = $20
Total cost for the second amusement park = $28 + $20 = $48

Now, let's subtract the cost of the second amusement park from the cost of the first amusement park:
$76 - $48 = $28

The final answer is: $28"
"To find out how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, we need to first find out how much money he saves a day. 

He used to buy 500 tomatoes a day for $.5 each, so that's 500 x $.5 = $250 a day. 

Now, he buys them for $.4 each, so that's 500 x $.4 = $200 a day. 

The difference is $250 - $200 = $50 a day. 

Since there are 7 days in a week, he saves $50 x 7 = $350 a week.

The final answer is: $350"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

We know Sean has 56 marbles. 

Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, Cal must have twice as many marbles as Sean. 
So, Cal has 56 * 2 = 112 marbles.

We also know Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. 
So, Carl has 56 * 4 = 224 marbles.

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined. 
To do that, we add the number of marbles Carl and Cal have. 
Carl has 224 marbles and Cal has 112 marbles. 
So, 224 + 112 = 336.

54 ÷ 6 = 9 students per group.

Now, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of students per group to find out how many groups are needed. 

54 ÷ 9 = 6 groups.

Since the activity requires 12 groups, we need to find out how many more groups are needed. 

12 (required groups) - 6 (actual groups) = 6 more groups are needed.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented in one month and then multiply it by 2.

There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week. 

Weekdays: 60 chairs/day * 5 days = 300 chairs
Weekends: 100 chairs/day * 2 days = 200 chairs
Total chairs per week: 300 + 200 = 500 chairs

There are 4 weeks in a month. 
Total chairs per month: 500 chairs/week * 4 weeks = 2000 chairs

Since we want to know the total chairs rented in two months, we multiply the total chairs per month by 2.
Total chairs in two months: 2000 chairs/month * 2 months = 4000 chairs

The final answer is: 4000"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Gunther had 48 bananas initially.
2. Arnold stole half of the bananas, so he took 48 / 2 = 24 bananas. Now, Gunther has 48 - 24 = 24 bananas left.
3. Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile, so now he has 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.
4. Arnold stole 12 bananas, so now Gunther has 49 - 12 = 37 bananas left.
5. Gunther added 6 bananas to his pile, so now he has 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

So, when Gunther began counting bananas, he found 43 bananas in the pile."
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year, we need to first find out how much they will pay per month. 

The electricity bill is $100 per month. Since there are 4 roommates, we need to divide $100 by 4 to find out how much each roommate will pay per month.

$100 / 4 = $25

Since there are 12 months in a year, we need to multiply the monthly amount by 12 to find out how much each roommate will pay per year.

$25 * 12 = $300

So each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"To find out how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to subtract the broken ones from the total number of glasses and plates he sent.

First, let's find out how many glasses and plates Jeff sent in total. 

1 dozen is equal to 12. So, 8 dozen glasses is 8 x 12 = 96 glasses. 
4 dozen plates is 4 x 12 = 48 plates.

Now, let's subtract the broken ones. 
96 glasses - 10 broken glasses = 86 glasses.
48 plates - 6 broken plates = 42 plates.

So, Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates now. 

The final answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 x 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading small stickers.

Step 2: Now, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left. 
She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 x 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.

Step 3: Now, Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. 
She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. 
Since each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, she gets 20 x 3 = 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.

Step 4: Now, we need to find out how many small buttons she got from trading large stickers and the 3 small stickers she had left. 
She got 60 small buttons from trading large stickers and 3 small stickers are worth 3 small buttons. 
So, she has 60 + 3 = 63 small buttons.

Step 5: Now, we need to find out the total number of buttons she has. 
She has 27 small buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, and 63 small buttons from trading large stickers and the 3 small stickers she had left. 
So, the total number of buttons she has is 27 + 20 + 63 = 110 buttons.

"Let's say the number of votes against the new regulation is x. 

Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice as many as the votes against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

The total number of people on the council is 33, so the sum of the votes in favor and against the new regulation is 33. 

We can write an equation to represent this: x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

Since x is the number of votes against the new regulation, the number of votes in favor is 2x, which is 2 * 11 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Let's say the second house needs x cases of shingles. Then the first house needs 1/2 of x, which is x/2. 

The third house needs double the first house, so it needs 2 * (x/2) = x.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. So, we can write an equation: x + x/2 + x = 250.

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying the whole numbers by 2. 

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms: 5x = 500

Now, divide both sides by 5: x = 100

So the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The first house needs 100/2 = 50 cases of shingles. The third house needs 2 * 50 = 100 cases of shingles.

The third house needs 100 cases of shingles."

200 x 0.45 = 90

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas. To find the total number of pears, we add 90 to 200. 

200 + 90 = 290

Now, we know George has 290 pears. To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and pears together. 

200 (bananas) + 290 (pears) = 490

He has 25 ears of corn, and he needs to make $75 from selling them. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we need to divide $75 by 25.

$75 ÷ 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3."
"To find out how much time Tatiana has left after reading, we need to subtract the time she reads from the total time. 

Total time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours
Time spent reading = 3 hours
Time left = Total time - Time spent reading = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Now, we need to find out how much time she spends playing video games. We know she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time. 

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * Time left = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Now, we need to find out how much time she has left for soccer. 

Time left for soccer = Time left - Time spent playing video games = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we need to divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time and multiply by 100.

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time) * 100

Distance to the museum = 150 miles
Speed = 75 mph

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since Jack drives to the museum and back, we need to multiply the time by 2.

Time to drive to the museum and back = 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours

Now, we add the time Jack spends at the museum to the time it takes him to drive to and from the museum.

Total time = Time to drive to the museum and back + Time at the museum
Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 10 hours

"To find the cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to break it down into parts.

First, let's find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:

600 movies / 3 = 200 movies in series

Since Mike can buy these series movies for $6 each, the cost of these movies is:

200 movies * $6 = $1200

Now, let's find out how many movies are not in series. We subtract the number of series movies from the total number of movies:

600 movies - 200 movies = 400 movies

Now, let's find out how many of these movies are older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate it as follows:

40% of 400 movies = 0.4 * 400 = 160 movies

Since older movies cost $5 each, the cost of these movies is:

160 movies * $5 = $800

Now, let's find out how many movies are normal movies. We subtract the number of older movies from the remaining movies:

400 movies - 160 movies = 240 movies

Since normal movies cost $10 each, the cost of these movies is:

240 movies * $10 = $2400

Now, let's add up the cost of all the movies:

$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

"To find the distance they drove, we need to multiply the speed by the time. The speed they drove was 50 miles per hour, and they drove for 4.5 hours (6 hours total - 1.5 hours hiking). 

Distance driven = speed * time 
Distance driven = 50 * 4.5 
Distance driven = 225 miles

To find the speed they hiked, we need to find half of their driving speed and subtract 5 miles per hour. 

Half of their driving speed = 50 / 2 
Half of their driving speed = 25 miles per hour

Speed they hiked = half of their driving speed - 5 
Speed they hiked = 25 - 5 
Speed they hiked = 20 miles per hour

To find the distance they hiked, we multiply the speed by the time. 

Distance hiked = speed * time 
Distance hiked = 20 * 1.5 
Distance hiked = 30 miles

To find the total distance, we add the distance driven and the distance hiked.

Total distance = distance driven + distance hiked

They ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 times.

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, so they ride 3 * 2 = 6 times on each of those days.

So, on the two special days, they ride 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Now, we add the times they ride on usual days and the times they ride on the special days: 15 + 12 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's break this down step by step.

Bob initially had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 orange and 4 white.

He went to the pet store and got 17 fish. Let's say the number of white fish he bought is x. Then, the number of orange fish he bought is 17 - x (since the total number of fish he bought is 17).

Now, let's add the fish he bought to his pond. The total number of fish in his pond is now 7 + 17 = 24.

We know that he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. So, the number of orange fish is 2 times the number of white fish. We can write this as an equation:

3 + (17 - x) = 2(4 + x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 + 17 - x = 8 + 2x

Combine like terms:

20 - x = 8 + 2x

Add x to both sides:

20 = 8 + 3x

Subtract 8 from both sides:

12 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

4 = x

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total miles driven per week and then multiply it by the cost of gas per gallon.

First, let's find out how many miles Andy drives per week. Since he drives to work and back home every day from Monday to Friday, the total miles driven per day is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles. 

So, the total miles driven per week is 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles/week.

Now, let's find out how many gallons of gas Andy uses per week. Since his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, we can divide the total miles driven per week by the fuel efficiency to get the total gallons used per week: 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, we can multiply the total gallons used per week by the cost of gas per gallon to find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week: 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the amount she spent from the quarters and the twenties separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the total amount of money she got from the quarters. There are 10 twenties, but we don't need to know that for the quarters. We know she got 140 quarters. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, or $0.25. 

So, the total amount of money from the quarters is 140 x $0.25 = $35.

Now, let's find the amount of money she got from the twenties. She got 10 twenties, and each twenty is worth $20. But she only spent 3/5 of the twenties. 

3/5 of 10 is 6. So, she spent 6 twenties. The amount of money from the twenties is 6 x $20 = $120.

Now, let's add the amount of money from the quarters and the twenties together. $35 + $120 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to find the total number of tomatoes and the total number of eggplants. 

First, let's find the total number of tomatoes. Since each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes and Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants, we multiply 22 by 5. 
22 * 5 = 110 tomatoes

Next, let's find the total number of eggplants. Since each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants and Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants, we multiply 4 by 8. 
4 * 8 = 32 eggplants

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and the total number of eggplants to find the total number of fruits. 
110 + 32 = 142

The final answer is: 142"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that one-fourth of the TVs sold are smart TVs. To find out how many smart TVs were sold, we need to multiply the total number of TVs by one-fourth. 

One-fourth is the same as 1/4, so we can multiply 40 by 1/4. 

40 * 1/4 = 40 / 4 = 10

So, 10 smart TVs were sold.

Next, we know that one-eighth of the TVs sold are analog TVs. To find out how many analog TVs were sold, we need to multiply the total number of TVs by one-eighth. 

One-eighth is the same as 1/8, so we can multiply 40 by 1/8. 

40 * 1/8 = 40 / 8 = 5

So, 5 analog TVs were sold.

Now, we know that the rest of the TVs sold are OLED TVs. To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we need to subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs.

Total TVs = 40
Smart TVs = 10
Analog TVs = 5

OLED TVs = Total TVs - (Smart TVs + Analog TVs)
= 40 - (10 + 5)
= 40 - 15
= 25

So, 25 OLED TVs were sold.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to know how much the school is covering and how much the trip costs. The school is covering half the cost of the trip, which is $300 / 2 = $150. 

Since John already has $50, we need to subtract that from the total cost of the trip to find out how much he still needs. 

$300 (total cost) - $150 (school's contribution) = $150 (John's contribution needed)
$150 (John's contribution needed) - $50 (John's money) = $100 (money John is missing)

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we need to know the temperature at night. 

It was 45 degrees during the day, and it's 33 degrees colder during the night. So, we subtract 33 from 45 to find the temperature at night.

45 - 33 = 12 degrees

Now, we need to find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to get the temperature from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. 

We subtract 12 from 32 to find out how many degrees Carson needs to heat the house.

32 - 12 = 20 degrees

Since every log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, we need to divide 20 by 5 to find out how many logs Carson needs to burn.

20 / 5 = 4

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many groups were formed, we need to divide the total number of people by the number of people in each group. 

Total people = 90
Number of people in each group = 9

Number of groups = Total people / Number of people in each group
= 90 / 9
= 10

Now, we need to find out how many groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells.

Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * Number of groups
= 3/5 * 10
= 6

Now, we need to find out how many seashells were brought back in total. Each group brought back 2 seashells.

Total seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Number of seashells each group brought
= 6 * 2

"To find out how many people are on the train, we need to do some subtraction and addition.

First, we start with 172 people on the train.

At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
172 - 47 = 125

Then, 13 people get on the train, so we add 13 to 125:
125 + 13 = 138

Next, at the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
138 - 38 = 100

So, there are 100 people on the train.

First, let's find out how much money he makes each day: 
10 bottle caps * $.25 = $2.50 per day

Now, let's multiply the daily amount by the number of days in the month: 
$2.50 * 30 = $75

So, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month."
"To find out how much Jamie was paid, we need to calculate her regular pay and her extra pay. 

First, let's find her regular pay. She earns $20 per hour for 8 hours of work. So, her regular pay is 20 * 8 = $160.

Since she worked 11 hours, she worked 11 - 8 = 3 extra hours. Her special hourly rate is 150% of her regular hourly rate. To find this rate, we multiply her regular rate by 150% or 1.5. So, her special rate is 20 * 1.5 = $30 per hour.

Now, we multiply her special rate by the number of extra hours she worked. 30 * 3 = $90.

To find her total pay, we add her regular pay and her extra pay. 160 + 90 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"

First, we know there are 12 female lions. 
Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can find the number of male lions by dividing the number of female lions by 2. 
12 / 2 = 6 male lions.

Now, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions. 
12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to first find out how much he will pay for the jeans. 

The original price of the jeans is $40. They are 25% off, so we need to find 25% of $40. 

25% of $40 is 0.25 x $40 = $10. 

So the jeans are $10 off. 

The price of the jeans now is $40 - $10 = $30. 

Mike pays with a $50 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we need to subtract the price of the jeans from the $50 bill. 

$50 - $30 = $20.

So Mike will have $20 left over. 

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total salary for each month.

The company hires 20 new employees every month. After one month, the total number of employees will be 200 + 20 = 220.
After two months, the total number of employees will be 220 + 20 = 240.
After three months, the total number of employees will be 240 + 20 = 260.

The total salary for each month is the number of employees multiplied by the salary per employee. 

For the first month, the total salary is 200 * 4000 = 800,000 dollars.
For the second month, the total salary is 220 * 4000 = 880,000 dollars.
For the third month, the total salary is 240 * 4000 = 960,000 dollars.

To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to add the total salary for each month.
Total salary after three months = 800,000 + 880,000 + 960,000 = 2,640,000 dollars.

"Let's break it down step by step.

Billy's starting salary is $10 per hour. After 2 months, he gets a raise of $0.50 per hour, so his new salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After another year, he gets a raise of $1.00 per hour, so his final salary is $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary, so it's $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate how much they earn in 20 hours. 

Billy's earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

To find out how much more Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed, we need to know how many days he worked. We know he made $105 and he charges $.25 per branch. 

First, we need to find out how many branches he climbed in total. We can do this by dividing the money he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($.25). 

$105 / $.25 = 420 branches

Since we know he climbed 420 branches in total, we need to find out how many days he worked. We can do this by dividing the total number of branches (420) by the number of branches he climbed per day (which we don't know yet).

Let's call the number of days he worked ""x"". Then, the number of branches he climbed per day is 420/x.

We know that the total number of branches he climbed is equal to the number of branches he climbed per day multiplied by the number of days he worked. So, we can set up the equation:

420 = (420/x) * x

This equation is true for any value of x, so we can't find a specific number of days he worked. However, we can find the average number of branches he climbed per day. 

To do this, we can divide the total number of branches (420) by the number of days he worked (which we don't know). But we can use the information that he made $105 in a week (7 days). 

We can set up the equation:

$105 = (420/x) * 7

Now we can solve for x:

$105 = 2940/x

x = 2940 / $105
x = 28

So, Felix worked for 28 days. Now we can find the average number of branches he climbed per day:

420 branches / 28 days = 15 branches per day

- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each group, we need to subtract 4 petals from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

Now, let's subtract the total marshmallows used from the total marshmallows in the bag.
Marshmallows left = Total marshmallows - Total marshmallows used
Marshmallows left = 35 - 21
Marshmallows left = 14

Now, we need to find out how many S'mores each kid can make with the marshmallows left. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, we can divide the marshmallows left by 2 (because there are 2 kids).

S'mores each kid can make = Marshmallows left / 2
S'mores each kid can make = 14 / 2
S'mores each kid can make = 7

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter. His friends can play for half as long (10 minutes) or 1.5 times as long (30 minutes). 

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 4 hours, there are 4 x 60 = 240 minutes.

Jack's friends who play for 10 minutes each will play for 240 / 10 = 24 times. The one who plays for 30 minutes will play for 240 / 30 = 8 times.

So, the total number of times they play is 24 + 8 + 1 (Jack) = 33 times.

Since Jack plays 20 minutes for 1 quarter, his friends play 10 minutes for 1 quarter and the other friend plays 30 minutes for 1 quarter. 

The total number of quarters used by Jack is 33 * 20 / 240 = 2.75 quarters. The total number of quarters used by the first two friends is 33 * 10 / 240 = 1.375 quarters. The total number of quarters used by the other friend is 33 * 30 / 240 = 4.25 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 2.75 + 1.375 + 4.25 = 8.375 quarters.

Since we can't use a fraction of a quarter, we round up to the nearest quarter. 8.375 quarters is 9 quarters.

"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's say the amount of citrus zest Tanya uses is Z. Since she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also Z.

Since she uses twice as much salt as zest, the amount of salt is 2Z.

Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil is 2 * 2Z = 4Z.

The total amount of the ingredients should equal 10 ounces. So, the equation is Z + Z + 2Z + 2Z + 4Z = 10.

Combine like terms: 10Z = 10.

Divide both sides by 10: Z = 1.

Now that we know Z = 1, we can find the amount of oil. The amount of oil is 4Z, so it's 4 * 1 = 4 ounces.

He gives away twice as many cars as he sold, which is 2 * 8 = 16.

So, Joe sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars. In total, he gave away 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

Joe had 40 cars initially and gave away 24 cars. So, he has 40 - 24 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to know how much money the students raised in total. We know that the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations. 

First, we need to find out how much money the students raised. We can do this by subtracting the money from the organizations from the total amount raised.

$175,000 (total) - $50,000 (from organizations) = $125,000 (from students)

Now, we know that 20 students raised $125,000. To find out how much each student raised, we need to divide the total amount raised by the number of students.

$125,000 (total from students) ÷ 20 (number of students) = $6,250

So each student raised $6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to first find the time she walked on the second day. 

She walked 8 hours on the first day. 
She walked half as many hours on the second day, so she walked 8 / 2 = 4 hours on the second day.

Now, we need to add the time she walked on both days. 
Time on the first day = 8 hours
Time on the second day = 4 hours
Total time = 8 + 4 = 12 hours

Since we need to find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the total time from hours to minutes. 
1 hour = 60 minutes
Total time in minutes = 12 * 60 = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Hunter counted 50 cars when he entered class.
2. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.
3. When he got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 of the cars had left. To find out how many cars left, we need to divide the total number of cars by 2. 
   70 / 2 = 35 cars left.
4. Since 35 cars left, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot is 70 - 35 = 35.
5. But we need to find the total number of cars he counted during lunch break. This is the number of cars that were there when he got out of class for lunch, which is 70."
"To find out how much John makes in a day, we need to multiply the number of cycles he does in a day by the number of tasks in each cycle and the pay for each task.

Number of cycles in a day: 30
Number of tasks in each cycle: 5
Pay for each task: $1.20

Daily earnings = Number of cycles * Number of tasks * Pay per task
Daily earnings = 30 * 5 * $1.20
Daily earnings = 30 * 6
Daily earnings = $180

Now, to find out how much John makes in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7.

Weekly earnings = Daily earnings * 7
Weekly earnings = $180 * 7
Weekly earnings = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find out how many points Sasha scored in the first game, we already know that she scored 14 points. 

In the first game, Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha. So, we need to subtract 4 from Sasha's points to find out how many points Julie scored. 
Julie's points in the first game = Sasha's points in the first game - 4 
= 14 - 4 
= 10 points

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. So, we need to subtract 6 from Julie's points in the first game to find out how many points Sasha scored in the second game. 
Sasha's points in the second game = Julie's points in the first game - 6 
= 10 - 6 
= 4 points

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we need to add her points from both games. 
Total points = Sasha's points in the first game + Sasha's points in the second game 
= 14 + 4 
= 18 points

The final answer is: 18"
"To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we need to find out how many tins of cat food and dog food she bought in total.

Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. So, she bought 8 x 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins. So, she bought 6 x 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food. To do this, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 88 - 36 = 52.

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say PJ has x cards. 
Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341. So, we can write an equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have:
Smendrick has 3x = 3(47) = 141 cards
Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 147 cards

The final answer is: 147"
"Let's break it down step by step:

- Cindy had 5 green eggs.
- She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 x 5 = 10 blue eggs.
- She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
- She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the shipping cost and the refund amount.

The shipping cost is calculated by multiplying the weight of the book by the cost per pound and adding the cost per mile. 

Shipping cost = (weight * cost per pound) + (distance * cost per mile)
Shipping cost = (4 * $0.35) + (20 * $0.08)
Shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60
Shipping cost = $3.00

The refund amount is 75% of the book's purchase price.
Refund amount = 0.75 * $32
Refund amount = $24

Now, we need to find the total amount Milly will lose, which is the shipping cost minus the refund amount.
Total loss = Shipping cost - Refund amount
Total loss = $3.00 - $24
Total loss = -$21

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to know how much he produced in the first three weeks. 

In the first week, Boris produced 8,000 bars of chocolate. 
In the second week, Boris produced half as much as the first week, so he produced 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars of chocolate. 
In the third week, Boris produced three times as much as the first week, so he produced 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars of chocolate.

Now, let's add up the total amount of chocolate produced in the first three weeks: 
8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars of chocolate.

Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. To find out how much he produced in the fourth week, we need to subtract the total amount of chocolate produced in the first three weeks from the total amount of chocolate produced each month:

"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the total time she spends on TikTok in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on TikTok in a week:

- She records 18 videos, each 4 minutes long, so that's 18 x 4 = 72 minutes.
- She spends 2 hours writing songs, which is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes.
- She spends 15 minutes each day for 6 days, so that's 15 x 6 = 90 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time she spends on TikTok in a week:
72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 282 minutes to hours:
282 / 60 = 4.7 hours

Now, let's multiply the time she spends on TikTok in a week by 4 to find out how much time she spends in a month:
4.7 hours/week x 4 weeks/month = 18.8 hours

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of the initial installation is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures, we need to find the number of additional items she needs.

Additional mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2
Additional chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1
Additional pictures: 20 - 10 = 10

The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item. So, the total cost of the additional items is:
2 mirrors * $15.00 = $30.00
1 chandelier * $15.00 = $15.00
10 pictures * $15.00 = $150.00

Total cost of additional items: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

Now, we add the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items:
$129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

The total cost for Angela will be $324.00."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of $30.00, we multiply $30.00 by 0.4 (which is the same as 40%): $30.00 * 0.4 = $12.00.
4. Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we add the 40% ($12.00) to Anthony's savings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to find out how high Saskay can lift a mountain, then multiply it by 4 to find out how high Kagiyami can lift a mountain, and then multiply that by 10 to find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain.

Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, and Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. So Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami can, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we need to divide 480 by 12 to find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain in feet.

480 / 12 = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total miles Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance he covered in the first 4 hours and the distance he covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed x Time

For the first 4 hours:

For the next 6 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total miles Mason has traveled:
Total Distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, then 1 kangaroo will take 18 * 3 = 54 hours to travel across the highway.

If a turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, then it will take a turtle twice as long to travel across the highway. So, 1 turtle will take 54 * 2 = 108 hours to travel across the highway.

If there are 4 turtles, then it will take them 108 * 4 = 432 hours to travel across the highway.

The final answer is: 432"
"Let's break it down step by step.

Kora made 20 dishes. 
Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 x 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, let's add up the total number of dishes they made together: 
20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140

The final answer is: 140"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The laptop costs $600.
- The price is reduced by $200 if she trades in her old laptop, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
- Erika already has some savings in her purse.
- She got $150 from her part-time job.
- Her mom gave her $80.
- She now only needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

So, the total amount of money she has is the sum of her savings, the money from her job, and the money from her mom. Since she only needs $50 more, we can set up an equation:

Total money = Savings + $150 + $80 - $50 (since she already has the $50 she needs)
Total money = Savings + $180

We know that the total money is the price of the new laptop, which is $400. So, we can set up the equation:

Savings + $180 = $400

To find the savings, we need to subtract $180 from both sides of the equation:

Savings = $400 - $180
Savings = $220

So, Erika has $220 in her purse."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many slices Adam gets from the large apples. Since 1 large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, 3 large apples will be sliced into 3 x 5 = 15 pieces.

Next, we need to find out how many slices Adam gets from the small apples. Since 1 small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, 5 small apples will be sliced into 5 x 3 = 15 pieces.

Now, we add the slices from the large and small apples together. 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30 slices in total.

Adam eats 15 slices, so we need to subtract 15 from the total number of slices. 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we need to first find out how many cows he needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day. 

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we can divide 25 by 5 to find out how many cows are needed. 

25 / 5 = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to subtract 3 from 5 to find out how many more cows he needs.

5 - 3 = 2

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each used part and subtract it from the original length of the glue stick.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the used part is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6. The length of the used part is 5/6 * 12 = 10 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the used part is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. The length of the used part is 1/3 * 12 = 4 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the used part is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. The length of the used part is 1/2 * 12 = 6 millimeters.

Now, we need to find the total length of the used parts: 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is the original length minus the total length of the used parts: 12 - 20 = -8 millimeters.

However, since we can't have a negative length, this means that the glue sticks are not long enough to cover the total length of 12 millimeters."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to add up the cost of the car and the phone, then subtract the money he already has.

The cost of the car is $10000 and the cost of the phone is $800. 

$10000 + $800 = $10080

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200. 

$5000 + $200 = $5200

Now, we need to subtract the money Gabriel has from the total cost of the car and the phone.

$10080 - $5200 = $4880

So, Gabriel still needs $4880."
"To find out how much change Thea got, we need to subtract the cost of the hat from the amount of money she gave the craftsman. 

First, let's find the total amount of money Thea gave the craftsman. She gave 4 $20 bills, so that's 4 x $20 = $80.

Now, let's subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount of money she gave the craftsman. $80 - $70 = $10.

So, Thea got $10 as change."
"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to first calculate how much money he spent. 

Craig bought 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so he spent 6 x 2 = 12 dollars on squirt guns.

He also bought 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so he spent 3 x 3 = 9 dollars on water balloons.

In total, Craig spent 12 + 9 = 21 dollars.

Craig started with 2 twenty dollar bills, which is 2 x 20 = 40 dollars.

So, Craig has 40 - 21 = 19 dollars left.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many socks as dishes, so Jack has 2 x 60 = 120 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2 x 120 = 240 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.
5. To find the total number of socks and dishes they have together, we add the number of socks and dishes that Jack and Peter have: 120 + 240 + 60 + 30 = 450.

The final answer is: 450"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

There are 20 students in total. 5 students are good at math only and 8 students are good at English only. The rest are good at both math and English. 

Let's find out how many students are good at both math and English. We know that 5 + 8 = 13 students are good at math or English only. So, the rest of the students are good at both. 

20 (total students) - 13 (students good at math or English only) = 7 students good at both math and English.

Now, we need to find out how many students are good at math. We already know that 5 students are good at math only. So, we add the students who are good at both math and English to the students who are good at math only. 

5 (students good at math only) + 7 (students good at both math and English) = 12 students good at math.

"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to find out how much time is available for performances. 

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes. 

There is a 10-minute intermission, so we need to subtract that from the total time: 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Each group takes 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes to perform and exit. 

To find out how many groups can perform, we need to divide the available time by the time each group takes: 110 / 10 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest she earns each year and add it to the original amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225.

So, the interest she earns in the first year is $225. 
The total amount after the first year is $300 + $225 = $525.

In the second year, the interest rate is still 3/4 of the new total amount, which is 3/4 * $525 = $393.75.
The interest she earns in the second year is $393.75. 
The total amount after the second year is $525 + $393.75 = $918.75.

In the third year, the interest rate is still 3/4 of the new total amount, which is 3/4 * $918.75 = $345.5625.
The interest she earns in the third year is $345.5625. 
The total amount after the third year is $918.75 + $345.5625 = $1264.3125.

The final answer is: $1264.31"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that half of the white shirts have collars. Since there are 40 white shirts, half of them would be 40 / 2 = 20 white shirts with collars. 

So, the number of white shirts with no collars would be 40 - 20 = 20.

Next, we know that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons. Since there are 50 floral shirts, the number of floral shirts with no buttons would be 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we need to find out how many more floral shirts with no buttons are there than white shirts with no collars. To do this, we subtract the number of white shirts with no collars from the number of floral shirts with no buttons: 30 - 20 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we need to know how many trays he can fill with 900 eggs. 

Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we can divide 900 by 30 to find out how many trays he can fill. 

900 ÷ 30 = 30 trays

Now, we know the farmer has 30 trays. He sells each tray for $2.5. To find out how much he will earn, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray.

30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"Let's break it down step by step.

Mr. Smith has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y. 

He sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 x 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, let's add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to know how many pairs of shoes he buys in a year. 

Since James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, we multiply 2 pairs by 12 months to get the total pairs in a year. 

2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

Now, we know James spends $2640 on shoes each year and he buys 24 pairs of shoes in a year. To find the average cost of each pair, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs.

$2640 / 24 pairs = $110 per pair

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food. 

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 x $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 x $18 = $54.

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the total discount is 3 x $2 = $6.

Now, subtract the discount from the cost of the red food: $54 - $6 = $48.

Add the cost of the green food and the discounted red food: $75 + $48 = $123.

The final answer is: $123"
"To find out how many rooms are in one-half of the motel, we need to divide 90 by 2. 

90 / 2 = 45

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it takes to clean 45 rooms. It takes 20 minutes to clean each room, so we multiply 45 by 20.

45 * 20 = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60.

900 / 60 = 15

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

In the first year, they will build 12 homes.

In the next year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 x 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years, which is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Then, they will double this amount, so 2 x 48 = 96 homes.

Now, we add the number of homes built each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Let's say my age is x. Since I am 3 years younger than my brother, my brother's age is x + 3.

My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so her age is 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of all our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms again: 5x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 15.6.

Since age can't be a decimal, I'm assuming the problem is asking for the age in whole numbers."
"To find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs, we need to multiply the number of students by the number of glue sticks each student needs. 

27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks needed by 8 to find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs.

54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 

6.75 packs → 7 packs

So, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

1. The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.
2. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles, so it becomes 2 x 4000 = 8000 gallons.
3. On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons, so we add 6000 to 8000, which is 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons."
"To find out how many people are infected after three days, we need to calculate the number of people infected each day.

Day 1: 
- Initially, there are 10 people infected.

- Total people infected after Day 1 = 10 (initial) + 60 (new) = 70.

Day 2: 
- There are 70 people infected now.
- Each infected person infects 6 others, so 70 * 6 = 420 new people are infected.
- Total people infected after Day 2 = 70 (previous) + 420 (new) = 490.

Day 3: 
- There are 490 people infected now.
- Each infected person infects 6 others, so 490 * 6 = 2940 new people are infected.
- Total people infected after Day 3 = 490 (previous) + 2940 (new) = 3430.

In a 1 year time frame (12 months), Claire will earn 1 * 12 = 12 badges.
Amber will earn 1/2 * 12 = 6 badges.
Wendy will earn 3 * 12 = 36 badges.

Let's say Anne has x books. 
Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has x + 25 books. 
Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Fawn has x + 12 books.

We know that together they have 85 books, so we can write an equation: 
x + (x + 25) + (x + 12) = 85

Combine like terms: 
3x + 37 = 85

Subtract 37 from both sides: 
3x = 48

"To find out how much Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure first.

She spent $400 on her hair. 
She spent 1/4 as much on her manicure, so that's 1/4 * 400 = $100 on her manicure.
She spent 3/4 as much on her pedicure as she did on her manicure, so that's 3/4 * 100 = $75 on her pedicure.

Now, we add up the costs: 
$400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575

The final answer is: $575"
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to first find out how much money she will get from selling the rope. 

She has a 20-meter long rope and she sells it for $2 a meter. So, she will get 20 x $2 = $40.

Now, she wants to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 a meter. Let's say the new rope is also 20 meters long. So, the cost of the new rope will be 20 x $1.5 = $30.

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the new rope from the money she got from selling the old rope. 

$40 - $30 = $10

So, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years. This means that right now, she is 18 - 10 = 8 years old.

We want to find out when her age will be three times her present age. Let's call the number of years it takes for her age to be three times her present age ""x"". 

So, her age after x years will be 8 + x. And three times her present age is 3 * 8 = 24.

We can set up an equation to solve for x: 8 + x = 24.

Now, let's solve for x: x = 24 - 8 = 16.

So, Melanie's age will be three times her present age in 16 years."
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken. Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and since 5 packs of bacon cost $10, each pack of bacon costs $10 / 5 = $2. So, each pack of chicken costs $2 x 2 = $4. Since Kelly has 6 packs of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is $4 x 6 = $24.

Next, let's find the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is $4 x 3 = $12.

Now, let's find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Since Kelly has 7 packs of apples, the total cost of the apples is $2 x 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Finally, let's subtract the total cost of the items from Kelly's budget: $65 (budget) - $60 (total cost) = $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say the usual concert is x minutes long. 

Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, the final concert is 2x minutes long. 

The final concert also includes a 15-minute encore. So, the total runtime of the final concert is 2x + 15 minutes. 

We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. 

So, we can set up the equation: 2x + 15 = 65 

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. 

First, we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15 
2x = 50 

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 50 / 2 
x = 25 

So, her usual concerts run for 25 minutes. 

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he had.

Argo had 200 toys initially. He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. 

First, let's add the number of toys he gave away: 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Now, let's subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he had: 200 - 150 = 50

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday and Wednesday, and then add twice the number made on Wednesday to that total.

First, we add the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday and Wednesday: 
125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) = 250

Then, we multiply the number of chimichangas made on Wednesday by 2 to find the number made on Friday: 
125 (Wednesday) * 2 = 250

Now, we add the number of chimichangas made on Friday to the total: 
250 (Tuesday and Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find the number of microphones that were arranged in pairs, we need to first find out how many microphones were left after 20% were left out. 

First, we find 20% of 50, which is 0.2 x 50 = 10. 

So, 10 microphones were left out. 

Now, we subtract 10 from 50 to find the number of microphones that were arranged in pairs. 

50 - 10 = 40

Since the microphones were arranged in pairs, we need to divide 40 by 2 to find the number of pairs. 

40 / 2 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of birds, we need to add the birds in the bushes, the birds flying overhead, and the birds feeding.

First, let's find the number of birds flying overhead. 2/3 of 6 is 4. 

So, the number of birds flying overhead is 4.

Next, let's find the number of birds feeding. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each, so the total number of birds feeding is 3 x 8 = 24.

Now, let's add the number of birds in the bushes, the birds flying overhead, and the birds feeding. 
6 (in the bushes) + 4 (flying overhead) + 24 (feeding) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to subtract the cookies Lani ate from the total number of cookies she baked, and then divide the result by the number of jars.

First, let's subtract the cookies Lani ate: 
55 (total cookies) - 5 (cookies eaten) = 50 cookies left

Now, let's divide the remaining cookies by the number of jars: 
50 cookies / 5 jars = 10 cookies per jar

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many more petals the daisies have, we need to first find out how many petals the orchids and daisies have in total. 

The orchids have 5 petals each and there are 5 orchids, so the total number of petals on the orchids is 5 x 5 = 25.

The daisies have 10 petals each and there are 4 daisies, so the total number of petals on the daisies is 10 x 4 = 40.

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of petals on the daisies and the total number of petals on the orchids. 

40 (daisies) - 25 (orchids) = 15

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the number of indoor plants, we need to multiply 100 by 1/4. 
100 * 1/4 = 25

Now, we have 100 - 25 = 75 plants left. 
To find the number of outdoor plants, we need to multiply 75 by 2/3. 
75 * 2/3 = 50

Now, we have 75 - 50 = 25 plants left. 
These 25 plants are flowering plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we need to divide 25 by 100 and multiply by 100. 
(25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we need to know how fast a thingamabob spins. We know that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, and a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. 

Let's find out how fast a thingamabob spins. If a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, then we can divide the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11 to find the speed of the thingamabob. 

Speed of thingamabob = Speed of whatchamacallit / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. We know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. 

Speed of whirligig = Speed of thingamabob * 5
Speed of whirligig = 11 * 5
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

The final answer is: 55"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs $6. The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3. 

The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. 

Since Ellen pays $11 for all her goods and the salad and yogurt cost $9, the cost of two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2. 

To find the cost of one carrot, we need to divide the cost of two carrots by 2. So, $2 / 2 = $1. 

The final answer is: $1"
"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to find out how much he makes in a day and then multiply it by 5.

Mark works 8 hours a day and his new pay is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

So, he makes $12 x 8 = $96 per day.

Now, we multiply $96 by 5 to find out how much he makes in a week.

$96 x 5 = $480

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Tasha mowed Joe's lawn x times. 

The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 
The total number of lawns she mowed the first week is x + 3x = 4x.

The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times. 
The total number of lawns she mowed the second week is 5x.

The total number of lawns she mowed is 4x + 5x = 9x.

We know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work. Since we don't know how many lawns she mowed for Joe, we can say that the amount she made from mowing lawns for Joe is $6.

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is 9x * 6 = 54x.

We know that the total amount she made from mowing lawns and lemonade sales is $80. So, we can set up the equation:

54x + y = 80

We also know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn. Since we don't know how many lawns she mowed for Joe, we can say that the amount she made from mowing lawns for Joe is $6. 

Since we don't know how many lawns she mowed for Joe, we can say that the amount she made from mowing lawns for Joe is $6.

Martin's weight is 55 kg. 
Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"To find out how much John makes in a month, we need to multiply the number of times he rents his car by the number of hours he rents it each time, and then multiply that by his hourly rate.

He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so that's 10 x 3 = 30 hours.

He gets paid $25 an hour, so 30 hours x $25 per hour = $750.

His car payment is $500, so to find out how much profit he makes, we need to subtract his car payment from the total amount he makes.

$750 - $500 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Martha bought 5 more notebooks and now has a total of 7 notebooks. This means she had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks before buying more.

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, and Martha had 2 notebooks, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has 6 notebooks. So, Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews. There are 6 nephews. 

96 ÷ 6 = 16

So each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies."

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. This means Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today.

So, Denise read a total of 10 + 18 = 28 pages. 

Daniel read a total of 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today, so he read 13 pages in total.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to subtract the total number of pages Daniel read from the total number of pages Denise read. 

28 (Denise's total pages) - 13 (Daniel's total pages) = 15

"To find out how many times the children can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to know how many bowls are left after dinner. 

There are 4 adults and 2 children, so in total, there are 4 + 2 = 6 people eating dinner. 

Each person eats one bowl, so 6 people will eat 6 bowls. 

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since 6 people are eating dinner, we can say that 6 bowls are being eaten. 

Since 4 adult bowls equal 6 bowls, we can say that 4 adult bowls are being eaten. 

Now we know that 4 adult bowls are being eaten, and the pot can fill 4 adult bowls. This means that there are 0 adult bowls left. 

Since 4 adult bowls equal 8 child bowls, we can say that 8 child bowls are being filled. 

Now we know that 6 bowls are being eaten, and the pot can fill 8 child bowls. This means that 2 child bowls are left. 

Since there are 2 child bowls left, and there are 2 children, each child can have 2 / 2 = 1 bowl of soup for lunch.

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen: $7.50 + $0.5 = $8

So, William spent $8 in all."
"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total material needed for small masks and large masks separately, then add them together.

For small masks: 
- 2 yards of material makes 4 small masks
- To make 20 small masks, we need (20 / 4) * 2 = 10 yards of material

For large masks: 
- 2.25 yards of material makes 3 large masks
- To make 8 large masks, we need (8 / 3) * 2.25 = 6 yards of material

Now, we add the material needed for small and large masks together: 
10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to divide the total amount she spent by the total number of tickets she bought.

Deepa saw 9 movies, and she saw each one 3 times, so she bought a total of 9 x 3 = 27 tickets.

The total amount she spent is $216.

To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount by the total number of tickets: $216 ÷ 27 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find out how much free time Harold has, we need to know how many hours are in a day. There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. 
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours a day. 
He walks his dog for 1 hour a day. 

Now, let's add up the hours he uses for sleeping, working, and walking his dog: 
10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours

Now, let's subtract the hours he uses from the total hours in a day to find out how much free time he has: 
24 (total hours in a day) - 19 (hours used) = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many red shoe boxes Tim used, we need to find 1/3 of 9. 

1/3 of 9 is 9 / 3 = 3. 

So, Tim used 3 red shoe boxes. 

Now, we need to find out how many red shoe boxes are left. 
9 (total red shoe boxes) - 3 (used red shoe boxes) = 6 red shoe boxes left.

To find out how many blue shoe boxes are left, we need to subtract the blue shoe boxes Tim used from the total blue shoe boxes. 
7 (total blue shoe boxes) - 3 (used blue shoe boxes) = 4 blue shoe boxes left.

So, Tim has 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many books Joseph had before losing 2, we need to know how many books he had initially. Since he had twice the number of Sarah's books, and Sarah has 9 books, Joseph had 2 x 9 = 18 books.

Then, Joseph lost 2 books, so we need to subtract 2 from 18. 

18 - 2 = 16

So, Joseph currently has 16 books. 

16"
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first find out how many marbles he gave to Jamie. 

1/5 of 30 is 30 / 5 = 6. 

So Dean gave 6 marbles to Jamie. 

Now, Dean gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

So, in total, Dean gave away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Dean had 30 marbles initially. He gave away 16 marbles. 

So, Dean has 30 - 16 = 14 marbles left.

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Adam's age four years ago was x. 

Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write an equation: 
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
60 - 8 = 2 * (x - 4)

Simplifying the equation:
52 = 2x - 8

Adding 8 to both sides:
60 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:
30 = x

So Adam's age four years ago was 30. 

Now, we need to find Adam's age in 8 years. 
Adam's current age = 30 + 4 = 34
Adam's age in 8 years = 34 + 8 = 42

The final answer is: 42"
"To find out how many acres Farmer Smith's farm has, we need to first find out how many acres it is. 

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Twice that would be 2 x 200 = 400 acres. 100 acres more than that would be 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres. 

Now, we need to add the acres of both farms together. 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The final answer is: 700"
"To find out how much money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to know how many packages he completes in that time. 

He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so we need to subtract 10 from 50 to find out how many packages he completes per hour. 

50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Now, we need to multiply the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours he works in a day. 

40 packages per hour * 8 hours = 320 packages per day.

Now, we need to multiply the number of packages he completes per day by the amount of money he gets paid per package. 

320 packages * $0.20 per package = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to know how long it takes him to solve the puzzles and then divide that by the time it takes him to drink a bottle of water.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so an extreme sudoku takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

The total time it takes to solve both puzzles is 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to convert the total time to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 225 minutes is 225 / 60 = 3.75 hours.

Since there are 2 half hours in an hour, there are 2 * 3.75 = 7.5 half hours in 3.75 hours.

John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, so in 7.5 half hours, he drinks 7.5 bottles of water.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon. 

We also know that he threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at the balloons. 

Let's say the number of yellow balloons is y. Since there are 20 red balloons, the total number of balloons is 20 + y.

Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, the total number of bologna thrown at red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

The total number of bologna thrown at yellow balloons is 3y.

We know that the total number of bologna thrown is 58, so we can set up the equation: 40 + 3y = 58.

To solve for y, we need to isolate y. We can do this by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation: 3y = 58 - 40, which simplifies to 3y = 18.

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for y: y = 18 / 3, which simplifies to y = 6.

So, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to find out how many miles he drives in 30 days. 

He drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so we multiply 100 miles by 30 days. 

100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Now, we need to find out how many 1000 mile intervals are in 3000 miles. 

We can do this by dividing 3000 miles by 1000 miles. 

3000 miles / 1000 miles = 3

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break it down step by step.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 x 5 = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works in all three days: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. They bought a cake for $11.
2. They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, we need to find out how much 12 balloons cost. To do this, we can divide 12 by 2 to get 6, and then multiply 6 by $0.5 to get the cost of 12 balloons. 6 * $0.5 = $3.
3. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total cost of the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.
4. The total cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.
5. Since they combined their allowance to buy these things, the total amount of allowance they had is $28.
6. Since they both had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount of allowance by 2 to find out how much each one of them had. $28 / 2 = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"To find out how many pieces of fruit Kira bought, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges. 

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Then, we need to subtract the number of pieces Lola ate from the total number of fruits Kira bought.

14 (total fruits) - 2 (fruits eaten) = 12

So, there are 12 pieces of fruit left. 

12"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

There are 6 students playing tennis. Since there are twice that number playing volleyball, there are 6 x 2 = 12 students playing volleyball.

Now, we have 6 + 12 = 18 students playing either tennis or volleyball.

We also know that there are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer. To find the total number of students playing soccer, we add the number of boys and girls: 16 + 22 = 38.

Now, we add the number of students playing soccer to the number of students playing tennis or volleyball: 18 + 38 = 56.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total money raised, we need to find the total number of lollipops sold and the total cost of the lollipops. 

First, we find the total number of lollipops sold. Since each student sold 10 lollipops and there are 30 students, the total number of lollipops sold is 10 * 30 = 300.

Next, we find the total cost of the lollipops. Since they bought the lollipops for $0.5 each and they bought 300 lollipops, the total cost is 0.5 * 300 = $150.

Then, we find the total money raised from selling the lollipops. Since each lollipop was sold for $0.8 and they sold 300 lollipops, the total money raised is 0.8 * 300 = $240.

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total money raised. The profit is 240 - 150 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets: 
3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47

"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to know how many slices Josh eats per day. Since Josh eats twice as much as Abby, and Abby eats 2 slices a day, Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.

Now, we need to find out how many slices both Abby and Josh eat per day. Abby eats 2 slices and Josh eats 4 slices, so together they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices per day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days it will last, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat per day. 

24 slices / 6 slices per day = 4 days.

"Martha collects 1 shell every month. To find out how many shells she has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to count the number of months she has been collecting shells.

Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old, and she is now 10 years old. So, she has been collecting shells for 10 - 5 = 5 years.

There are 12 months in a year, so she has been collecting shells for 5 x 12 = 60 months.

Since she collects 1 shell every month, she has collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we need to first find out how many cups of tea are in each row. 

Lana has 27 cups of tea in total. She divides these into 3 rows. 

To find out how many cups are in each row, we need to divide 27 by 3. 

27 / 3 = 9 

So, there are 9 cups in each row. 

Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row will be half of the total cups in each row. 

9 / 2 = 4.5 

Since we can't have half a cup of tea, this means that Lana must have made 4 full cups of mint tea in each row and 1 cup of chamomile tea in each row, and then used the remaining cups to make cinnamon tea. 

However, the question asks for the number of cups of mint tea in each row. 

The answer is 4."
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to divide the total number of berries (24) by the number of trips he can make in 8 hours.

First, we need to find out how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.  Since it takes him 4 hours to make one trip, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips in 8 hours.

Now, we need to divide the total number of berries (24) by the number of trips (2) to find the least number of berries he can pick up per trip. 

24 / 2 = 12

"Let's break down the information given:

- Colby has $150 to spend.
- He already saw 5 movies on Fridays and Saturdays, and 8 movies on other days. 
- He already spent money on 2 tubs of popcorn ($8 each) and 4 boxes of candy ($2 each).

First, let's calculate the total money Colby spent on popcorn and candy:
2 tubs of popcorn = 2 x $8 = $16
4 boxes of candy = 4 x $2 = $8
Total money spent on popcorn and candy = $16 + $8 = $24

Now, let's calculate the remaining money Colby has:
$150 - $24 = $126

Colby can see movies on Fridays and Saturdays for $10 each, or on other days for $7 each. Since it's the last day of the month and it's a Friday, he can see a movie on this day for $10. 

Let's calculate how many movies he can see on Fridays and Saturdays:
Since he already saw 5 movies on Fridays and Saturdays, he can see 0 more movies on Fridays and Saturdays because he can only see one more movie on this last Friday.

Now, let's calculate how many movies he can see on other days:
He can see movies on other days for $7 each. He has $126 left, so he can see:
$126 / $7 = 18

So, Colby can see 18 movies on other days.

Now, let's add the movies he already saw (5 on Fridays and Saturdays, 8 on other days) and the movies he can see on other days (18):
5 + 8 + 18 = 31

"To find the calories of the mini pastries, we need to find the calories of one mini pastry first. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that. So, the calories of a mini cinnamon roll is 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that. So, the calories of a mini blueberry muffin is 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we need to find the total calories of all the mini pastries. There are 200 mini cinnamon rolls and 300 mini blueberry muffins. 

Total calories of mini cinnamon rolls = 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories
Total calories of mini blueberry muffins = 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories

Total calories of all pastries = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

"To find out how far the bus went, we need to multiply the speed of the bus by the time it traveled. 

Speed of the bus = 60 miles per hour
Time traveled by the bus = 5 hours
Distance traveled by the bus = Speed of the bus * Time traveled by the bus
Distance traveled by the bus = 60 * 5
Distance traveled by the bus = 300 miles

To find out how far the car went, we need to multiply the speed of the car by the time it traveled.

Speed of the car = 30 miles per hour
Time traveled by the car = 8 hours
Distance traveled by the car = Speed of the car * Time traveled by the car
Distance traveled by the car = 30 * 8
Distance traveled by the car = 240 miles

Now, we need to find out how much farther the bus went than the car. To do this, we need to subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus.

Distance traveled by the bus - Distance traveled by the car = 300 - 240
Distance traveled by the bus - Distance traveled by the car = 60

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."

"Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say John's age is x. 
Since Paul is 10 years older than John, Paul's age is x + 10.

We know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age. So, Peter's age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10.

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. We also know that Jean's age is not given, but we can represent it as y.

So, the equation becomes: (2x + 10) + (x + 10) + y = 100

Combine like terms: 3x + 20 + y = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides: 3x + y = 80

We still don't know the value of y, but we can represent it as 100 - (2x + 10) = 90 - 2x.

Now, substitute y in the equation: 3x + (90 - 2x) = 80

Combine like terms: x + 90 = 80

Subtract 90 from both sides: x = -10

We still don't know the value of y, but we can represent it as 100 - (2x + 10) = 90 - 2x.

Now, substitute y in the equation: 3x + (90 - 2x) = 80

Combine like terms: x + 90 = 80

Subtract 90 from both sides: x = -10

"Maria started with 1 water balloon. Her friends each got 2, so 4 friends * 2 balloons = 8 balloons. Now Maria has 1 + 8 = 9 balloons. Then her mom gave each person 3 more balloons. So 4 friends + 1 Maria = 5 people * 3 balloons = 15 balloons. Now we add the 9 balloons they already had to the 15 new balloons. 9 + 15 = 24. The answer is 24."
"To find out how many tables they need, we first need to know how many boxes of stuff they have in total. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so they get 10 x 5 = 50 boxes. 
They already have 10 boxes, so they have 50 + 10 = 60 boxes in total.

They can fit 2 boxes per table, so they need 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

They already have 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 more tables.

The answer is 15."
"To find the average total distance spat, we need to find the total distance spat by each person and then divide it by the number of seeds they spat.

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 x 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 x 12 = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both of them is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

They spat a total of 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance spat by the number of seeds spat: 820 / 75 = 10.93 (rounded to two decimal places).

The final answer is: 10.93"
"To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate how many widgets each machine makes in a month and then multiply that by the price of each widget.

First, let's find out how many widgets each machine makes in a month. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour and the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. 

There are 24 hours in a day and 30 days in a month, so we multiply 24 hours by 30 days to get the total hours in a month: 24 * 30 = 720 hours.

Now, we multiply the total hours in a month by the widgets each machine makes per hour to find out how many widgets each machine makes in a month. 

For the Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 720 hours = 43,200 widgets
For the WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 720 hours = 32,400 widgets

Now, we multiply the number of widgets each machine makes in a month by the price of each widget, which is $6. 

For the Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
For the WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Now, we subtract the amount of money the WidgetMaster 9000 makes from the amount of money the Widgeteer 3000 makes to find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000: $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The final answer is: $64,800"
"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay with the 24-hour option and the cost of his stay with the 12-hour option plus the additional hours.

Cameron stays for 17 hours (from 5 pm to 10 am the next day). 

The 24-hour option costs 1600 pesos. 

The 12-hour option costs 1000 pesos. For the additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5), Cameron will pay 5 x 70 = 350 pesos. 

So, the total cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour option: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The answer is 250."
"To find out how much hay each sheep needs, we need to find twice the amount each goat needs and then subtract 3 pounds. 

Twice the amount each goat needs is 2 x 5 = 10 pounds. 
3 pounds less than that is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds. 

So each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay. 

Now, we need to find out how much hay all the goats and sheep need. 

15 goats need 15 x 5 = 75 pounds of hay. 
12 sheep need 12 x 7 = 84 pounds of hay. 

To find the total amount of hay needed, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep. 
75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

"To find out how much money John has, we need to subtract the gas money from his earnings. 

John's earnings: 50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars
Gas money: 50 dollars
Money left: 300 dollars - 50 dollars = 250 dollars

Now, let's calculate how much money John will spend on pencils. 

Number of pencils: 5
Cost of each pencil: 10 dollars
Total cost of pencils: 5 * 10 dollars = 50 dollars

Now, let's subtract the cost of pencils from John's money left.

Money left after buying pencils: 250 dollars - 50 dollars = 200 dollars

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we need to subtract that from his money left.

Money left after deposit: 200 dollars - 100 dollars = 100 dollars

Now, let's find out how many 25 dollar pens John can buy.

Cost of each pen: 25 dollars

"The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

The teacher gives each of the 29 students 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles of apple juice given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher got. 

900 - 58 = 842

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To find the total amount Patty charged, we need to add the visit fee, labor cost, and parts cost.

The visit fee is $40.
The labor cost is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours, so we multiply 35 by 2.25 to get the labor cost: 35 * 2.25 = 78.75.
The parts cost is $60.

Now, we add the visit fee, labor cost, and parts cost together: 40 + 78.75 + 60 = 178.75.

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To find out how much James paid for the CDs, we need to calculate the price after the 40% discount. 

First, we find 40% of $15. 40% is the same as 0.4. So, 0.4 x $15 = $6. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price. $15 - $6 = $9. 

Since James bought 10 CDs, we multiply the discounted price by 10. $9 x 10 = $90. 

James sold 5 CDs for $40. To find out how much he made from selling them, we divide $40 by 5. $40 ÷ 5 = $8. 

Now, we subtract the money James made from the money he spent. $90 - $8 = $82. 

So, James was $82 out."
"To find out how much Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money she will get from selling each type of root crop and then add them together.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she will get from selling the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2 = $20

Then, let's calculate the total amount of money she will get from selling the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 = $5

Now, let's add the amounts together:
$9 + $20 + $5 = $34

So, Jen will earn $34 if she sells all of her root crops."
"To find the time it took James to swim 60% of the distance, we need to first find 60% of 20 miles. 

60% of 20 miles is 0.6 x 20 = 12 miles. 

Since James swims at 2 miles per hour, the time it took him to swim 12 miles is 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

After that, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, he has to swim the remaining 20 - 12 = 8 miles. 

Since he swims at half the speed, his new speed is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

The time it took him to swim the remaining 8 miles is 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

The total time it took him to get across the lake is 6 hours (swimming) + 3 hours (resting) + 8 hours (swimming) = 17 hours.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first find out how many loaves of bread seven times as many as Sam had last Friday. 

Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. 

Seven times as many as 70 is 7 x 70 = 490.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. So we need to subtract 40 from 490.

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."

"To find the total commission, we need to find the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal separately and then add them together.

Commission from New York Times: 
- Price of each New York Times = $5
- Commission on each New York Times = 10%
- Number of New York Times sold = 6
- Commission from New York Times = (10/100) * 5 * 6 = 0.1 * 5 * 6 = $3

Commission from Wall Street Journal: 
- Price of each Wall Street Journal = $15
- Commission on each Wall Street Journal = 8%
- Number of Wall Street Journal sold = 10
- Commission from Wall Street Journal = (8/100) * 15 * 10 = 0.08 * 15 * 10 = $12

Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
Total commission = $3 + $12
Total commission = $15

"Let's break it down step by step.

We know Deanna is 26 years old. Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna, so we subtract 5 from Deanna's age to find Marcus's age.

Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus's age = 26 - 5
Marcus's age = 21

We also know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. To find Leo's age, we need to multiply Marcus's age by 2.

Leo's age = 2 * Marcus's age
Leo's age = 2 * 21
Leo's age = 42

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo scored. If we let Azibo's score be A, then Bahati's score is A + 20.

It was also given that Bahati's score is 10 more than Dinar's score. If we let Dinar's score be D, then Bahati's score is D + 10.

Since Bahati's score is both A + 20 and D + 10, we can set these two expressions equal to each other:

A + 20 = D + 10

We also know that the total points scored by the three people is 45. So, we can write the equation:

A + (A + 20) + D = 45

Combine like terms:

2A + D + 20 = 45

Subtract 20 from both sides:

2A + D = 25

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can use the first equation (A + 20 = D + 10) to express D in terms of A:

D = A + 10

Substitute this expression for D into the second equation:

2A + (A + 10) = 25

Combine like terms:

3A + 10 = 25

Subtract 10 from both sides:

3A = 15

Divide both sides by 3:

A = 5

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To find out how many reports Vince stapled, we need to know how many minutes he stapled reports. 

First, we need to find out how many hours he stapled reports. He stapled reports from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, which is 11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 15 hours by 60 minutes to get the total minutes. 15 hours * 60 minutes = 900 minutes.

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15. 900 / 15 = 60.

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we multiply 60 sets of 15 minutes by 30 reports. 60 * 30 = 1800.

So, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether."
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to find out the total time she slept and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. So, she sleeps for 8 hours. 

8 hours = 8 * 60 minutes = 480 minutes

She woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. 

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. 

2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. is 23 minutes.

So, the total time she was sleepwalking is 23 minutes.

Now, we need to find out the total time she slept that day. She usually sleeps for 480 minutes, but she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual. So, she actually slept for 480 - 5 = 475 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking from the total time she slept. 

475 minutes - 23 minutes = 452 minutes

Number of spoons = 24 x 2/3 = 16 spoons.

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. To find the number of spoons he has left, we subtract 6 from 16.

Number of spoons left = 16 - 6 = 10 spoons.

Jonathan also has 24 cups. To find the total number of utensils he has remaining, we add the number of spoons left to the number of cups.

Total number of utensils = 24 + 10 = 34.

"To find the number of occupied beds, we need to multiply the total capacity by 1/5. 

1/5 of 1000 is 100. 

So, the number of occupied beds is 100. 

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to find out how many patients are admitted in 2 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 2 x 7 = 14 days. 

In 14 days, 50 patients are admitted each day, so the total number of patients admitted is 50 x 14 = 700. 

Now, we add the initial 100 occupied beds to the 700 patients admitted in 2 weeks. 

100 + 700 = 800. 

So, the total number of occupied beds is 800. 

To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity.

9 * 2/3 = 6 emails to her family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left. We already know that 6 are to her family, and 7 are work emails. So, the total emails we know about is 6 + 7 = 13. 

The total emails she sends is 16, so the emails left are 16 - 13 = 3.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Since Jason carried 2 balls, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, that means Jeffrey carried half of what Jason carried. So, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, that means Jordan carried 2 x 2 = 4 balls.

Now, we know that the total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them. So, the total number of balls carried by the three boys is 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

Since the three boys carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is equal to the number of balls carried by the three boys. 

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break it down step by step:

Day 1: 10 holes
Day 2: 13 holes
Day 3: 8 holes (but they filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes)

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

We know that at the end of the third day, there were 29 holes. So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's say the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got is x. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so x = 70.

Now, we can find out how many corn chips Collins got: x + 15 = 70 + 15 = 85.

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got: x + x + (x + 15) = 70 + 70 + 85 = 225.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of travel, we need to first find 50% of the cost of supplies. 50% of $400 is 0.5 x 400 = $200. 

The cost of travel is 50% more than the supplies, so we add the 50% to the cost of supplies. $200 + $200 = $400. 

The cost of travel is $400."
"Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say Adelwolfe has caught x number of Pokemon.

Since Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, Stan has caught 4x - 13 Pokemon.

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught (4x - 13) + 5 = 4x - 8 Pokemon.

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokemon, so we can set up the equation:

x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:

9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:

9x = 360

Divide both sides by 9:

x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon, we can find out how many Stan has caught:

Stan has caught 4x - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 Pokemon.

The final answer is: 147"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that each episode is 20 minutes long. 

Next, we know that there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. This means the number of episodes is 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show. To do this, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to find the total distance the bird traveled in the southerly direction and then add it to the distance the bird traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's find the distance the bird traveled in the southerly direction. The bird flew for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour. 

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour x 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Then, the bird flew for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour in the northerly direction. 

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour x 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Since the bird flew in the northerly direction, we need to subtract this distance from the distance the bird traveled in the southerly direction.

Distance traveled in the southerly direction = 300 miles
Distance traveled in the northerly direction = 36 miles
Net distance traveled in the southerly direction = 300 miles - 36 miles
Net distance traveled in the southerly direction = 264 miles

The bird also flew for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour in the southerly direction. 

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour x 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to add the net distance the bird traveled in the southerly direction and the distance the bird traveled in the last southerly direction.

Total distance = Net distance traveled in the southerly direction + Distance traveled in the last southerly direction
Total distance = 264 miles + 110 miles
Total distance = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"
"To find out how many brownies Greta had left over, we need to first find out how many brownies she had in total. 

Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself. 1 dozen is equal to 12. So, she had 12 brownies.

At her office, they sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies. 1/2 a dozen is equal to 6. So, she had 12 + 6 = 18 brownies.

When she arrived home, her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting. 4 dozen is equal to 48. So, she now had 18 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. 1 1/2 dozen is equal to 18. So, 66 - 18 = 48 brownies were left over.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's break it down step by step.

Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother is 8 x 2 = 16 years old.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. To find 25% of Nani's age, we multiply 8 by 0.25 (which is the same as 25%): 8 x 0.25 = 2. So, Nani's sister is 8 - 2 = 6 years old.

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members: Nani (8) + brother (16) + sister (6) = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time it takes for each type of string and add them together.

For synthetic gut: 3 racquets * 15 minutes = 45 minutes
For polyester string: 5 racquets * 22 minutes = 110 minutes
For hybrid sets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes = 72 minutes

Now, we add the time for each type of string together: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes

The final answer is: 227"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, John buys 2 phones at the full price of $600 each. 
2 x $600 = $1200

Then, he buys 2 more phones at half the price, which is $600 / 2 = $300 each.
2 x $300 = $600

Now, let's add the cost of all the phones together. 
$1200 + $600 = $1800

So, John paid $1800 for all the phones."
"To find out how many players Zeke's team has, we need to add 7 to the number of players Carlton's team has. 

Carlton's team has 13 players. 
Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.

Now, we need to add the number of players in both teams to find the total number of players. 

Total players = Carlton's players + Zeke's players
Total players = 13 + 20
Total players = 33

The final answer is: 33"
"To find out how many wooden slats Robert will need, we need to find the total length of the fence and multiply it by 2.

The length of the fence is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. To find the total length of the fence, we need to add the length and width together and multiply by 2 (since there are two sides of each length and width).

First, we multiply the length and width: 15 * 2 = 30 (for the longer sides) and 10 * 2 = 20 (for the shorter sides). 
Then, we add the two results together: 30 + 20 = 50.

Now, we multiply the total length by 2: 50 * 2 = 100.

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

The final answer is: 100"
"Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. Each box has 20 oranges. So, she bought 12 x 20 = 240 oranges.

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each. That's 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. Each box has 20 oranges, so she gave away 4 x 20 = 80 oranges.

She kept 1/4 of the oranges. 1/4 of 240 is 240 / 4 = 60 oranges.

So, she kept 60 oranges and gave away 80 oranges. To find out how many oranges she sold, we need to subtract the oranges she kept from the total oranges she had. 240 - 60 = 180 oranges.

The answer is 180."
"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to know the number of states in the USA and the number of states in India.

The USA has 50 states.

Half of 50 is 25. 

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, so India has 25 + 4 = 29 states.

To find the total number of states in both countries, we add the number of states in the USA and India: 50 + 29 = 79.

The final answer is: 79"
"To find out how many hours Tyler has to work, we need to know how much money he needs in total and then subtract the money he already has. 

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (cookbook) = $39.

Tyler already has $14, so he needs $39 - $14 = $25 more.

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we need to divide the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5) to find out how many hours he needs to work.

$25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours

"Let's break it down step by step. 

We know Robert has 30 cherries and he has 10 more than Richard. So, Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

Now, we know that Robert and Richard together have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries. 

Since they have 60 cherries in total, Jerry must have 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries. So, Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. 
On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. 
On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both days:
- Gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
- Apple pie: 11 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 26 boxes

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Sunny earned from selling gingerbread:
25 boxes * $6 per box = $150

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Sunny earned from selling apple pie:
26 boxes * $15 per box = $390

Now, let's add the total amount of money Sunny earned from selling gingerbread and apple pie:
$150 + $390 = $540

"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate how many ounces of sunscreen she will use in total. 

She uses 1 ounce of sunscreen per hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day. So, she uses 1 * 4 = 4 ounces of sunscreen per day.

She will be outside for 8 days, so she will use 4 * 8 = 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.

Since each bottle of sunscreen is 8 ounces, we need to divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces) to find out how many bottles she will need.

32 / 8 = 4

So, Pamela will need 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"To find the price of the red car, we need to find 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

First, let's find 40% of the price of the blue car. 40% is the same as 40/100 or 0.4. 

0.4 x $100 = $40

Now, we subtract $40 from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car.

$100 - $40 = $60

So, the price of the red car is $60.

The price of the blue car is $100 and the price of the red car is $60."
"Let's break this down step by step.

Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad and twice as old as his brother.

When Emil turns 24, his age will be 24. 

Since Emil will be half the age of his dad, his dad's age will be 2 * 24 = 48 years old.

Since Emil will be twice as old as his brother, his brother's age will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother. 

Emil's dad is 48 - 5 = 43 years old now (since Emil is 19 now and will be 24 in 5 years).

Emil's brother is 12 - 5 = 7 years old now.

The sum of their ages is 43 + 7 = 50."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.
2. Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
3. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 x 20 = 40 beads.
4. To find the total number of beads, we add the beads from her mother, sister, and friend: 20 + 30 + 40 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many servings Joe has, we need to calculate the total amount of crawfish he caught. 

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish. 
On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, so 3 * 4 = 12 pounds. 
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, so 12 / 2 = 6 pounds. 

Now, we add up the pounds of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds. 

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we divide the total pounds by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to find the total space she has available for plants. 

First, we need to convert the space between plants from feet to inches because the width of the plants is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 1.5 feet is 1.5 x 12 = 18 inches.

Now, we need to find the total space available for plants. The flower bed is 111 feet long, and we need to subtract the space between the plants. Since there are 17 plants, there will be 16 spaces between them. 

The total space available for plants is 111 feet x 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches. The total space taken up by the spaces between the plants is 16 x 18 inches = 288 inches. 

The total space available for the plants is 1332 - 288 = 1044 inches. 

Now, we need to divide the total space available for plants by the width of each plant to find out how many plants can fit. 1044 / 12 = 87.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 87 - 17 = 70 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so Pat will spend 70 x 6 = $420 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

"To find out how much Katherine will spend, we need to calculate the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the petunias. There are 5 baskets and each basket needs 3 petunias. So, the total number of petunias needed is 5 x 3 = 15. The cost of each petunia is $3.00, so the total cost of the petunias is 15 x $3.00 = $45.00.

Next, let's find the cost of the sweet potato vines. There are 5 baskets and each basket needs 2 sweet potato vines. So, the total number of sweet potato vines needed is 5 x 2 = 10. The cost of each sweet potato vine is $2.50, so the total cost of the sweet potato vines is 10 x $2.50 = $25.00.

Now, we add the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines together to find the total cost. $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much soil is used for the sunflowers and carnations. 
4 sunflowers need 4 x 3 = 12 pounds of soil.
10 carnations need 10 x 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil.

Now, we add the soil used for sunflowers and carnations. 
12 + 15 = 27 pounds of soil.

Now, we subtract the soil used for sunflowers and carnations from the total soil. 
30 - 27 = 3 pounds of soil left.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. So, we can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income. 

25% of $2,000 is 0.25 x $2,000 = $500.

Since she sets aside $500 each month, we need to find out how many months are in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

Now, we multiply the amount she sets aside each month by the number of months in a year: $500 x 12 = $6,000.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000, so we need to divide the total amount she sets aside in a year by the cost of one pair of shoes: $6,000 ÷ $1,000 = 6.

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first find out how many shrimp she can peel and cook in one minute.

She can peel 6 shrimp a minute, and she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. This means she can saute 3 shrimp a minute (30 shrimp / 10 minutes = 3 shrimp per minute).

So, in one minute, she can peel 6 shrimp and saute 3 shrimp, which means she can cook a total of 9 shrimp in one minute (6 peeled + 3 sauteed).

To find out how many minutes it will take her to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to divide 90 by 9 (the number of shrimp she can cook in one minute).

90 / 9 = 10

So, it will take Emily 10 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees an hour. So, it cooled the room by 3 x 2 = 6 degrees.

2. Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees an hour. So, it cooled the room by 4 x 3 = 12 degrees.

3. The total cooling effect of the air conditioner is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

4. However, the room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. The air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, so the room warmed up by 2 x 2 = 4 degrees.

5. To find the final temperature, we need to subtract the total cooling effect from the initial cooling effect and then add the warming effect. The initial cooling effect is 18 degrees, and the warming effect is 4 degrees. So, the final temperature is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

1. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
2. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. 
   So, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.
3. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the time between Bill's two sightings of the comet is 75 years.
4. To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to subtract 75 from his age at the second sighting.
   So, Bill's age at the first sighting = 90 - 75 = 15 years old.

"To find out how many checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the total number of checks he writes in a year.

- He writes 1 check per month for the electric bill, so that's 12 checks per year.
- He writes 1 check per month for the gas bill, so that's 12 checks per year.
- He writes 2 checks per month to the church, so that's 2 x 12 = 24 checks per year.
- He writes 1 check every 3 months (quarterly) to the pest and lawn service, so that's 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add up all the checks: 12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks per year.

"Let's break down the information given:

- The first plane goes to Greece for 3/4 of its flights, and the remaining flights are split between France and Germany.
- The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes in a day.

Since the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane must make 44 x 2 = 88 trips in a day.

The first plane goes to Greece for 3/4 of its flights, so it goes to Greece for (3/4) x 88 = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France and Germany combined is 88 - 66 = 22.

Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to find out how long each wolf howls and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 x 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the time of all three wolves together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

Adam's mother gave him $6. 
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 x $6 = $12. 
So, in total, Adam got $6 + $12 = $18 from his parents. 
He bought the trousers for $30. 
To find out how much he had to contribute from his savings, we need to subtract the money he got from his parents from the cost of the trousers. 
$30 - $18 = $12.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the total age of the children is 20. We also know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. 

First, let's add the ages of Akbar and Alessandro: 3 + 4 = 7.

Now, we know that the total age of the group is 20, and the ages of Akbar and Alessandro are 7. So, the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 20 - 7 = 13.

We also know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's call the average age of the group ""x"". Then, Helene's age is 2x.

The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of people in the group. There are 4 people in the group, so the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, Helene's age is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now that we know Helene's age, we can find Wilfred's age. We already know that the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 13. So, Wilfred's age is 13 - 10 = 3.

"Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from a fund he set up online. So, he collected a total of $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Then, his friend gives him $200, but we don't need to add this to the total because the lawyer's donation is based on the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund.

Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. So, the lawyer will donate 3 * $2000 = $6000."
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to find out how many cookies were there in total. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, we multiply 15 by 100.

15 * 100 = 1500 cookies

The bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church. To find 1/2 of 1500, we divide 1500 by 2.

1500 / 2 = 750 cookies

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got.

- Time per inpatient: 20 minutes
- Number of inpatients: 9
- Total time spent on rounds: 20 * 9 = 180 minutes

Now, let's convert the total time spent on rounds from minutes to hours:
- 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Next, let's calculate the time spent on appointments:
- Time per appointment: 30 minutes
- Number of appointments: 10
- Total time spent on appointments: 30 * 10 = 300 minutes

Now, let's convert the total time spent on appointments from minutes to hours:
- 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

Now, let's add the time spent on rounds and appointments to find the total time spent:
- Total time spent: 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours

Since Doctor Jones works for 9 hours, we subtract the total time spent from the total working hours to find the time left to update his records:
- Time left: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up the time it takes for each step and subtract that from the time she wants to serve the cake.

First, let's add up the time for each step:
- Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
- Baking the cake: 30 minutes
- Cooling the cake: 2 hours (120 minutes)
- Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 2 hours to minutes: 2 hours = 120 minutes

Now, let's add the total time to the 120 minutes: 180 + 120 = 300 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 300 minutes to hours and minutes: 300 minutes = 5 hours

Now, let's subtract the 5 hours from the time she wants to serve the cake (5:00 pm) to find the latest time she can start making the cake:
5:00 pm - 5 hours = 12:00 pm

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 12:00 pm.

The final answer is 12."
"Let's say there are x chocolate bars in a box. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We know they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation 8x = 64. 

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 8: x = 64 / 8 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of the students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, so it's rented 3 x 4 = 12 days in a month (assuming a 4-week month).

The cost to rent the studio per session is $25. 
The cost per student per session is $1.50.

The studio has 10 students, so the total cost per session for the students is 10 x $1.50 = $15.

The total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $15 (students) = $40.

Since the studio is rented 12 days in a month, the total number of sessions in a month is 12.

The total earnings per month is 12 x $40 = $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's say the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter is x. Since Peter has 4 boxes, the total number of chocolate bars he has is 4x. We know that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars, so we can set up the equation:

4x = 64

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 64 / 4
x = 16

So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, let's do the same for Martha. Let's say the number of chocolate bars in each box for Martha is y. Since Martha has 7 boxes, the total number of chocolate bars she has is 7y. We know that Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars, so we can set up the equation:

7y = 56

To find the value of y, we can divide both sides of the equation by 7:

y = 56 / 7
y = 8

So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha:

Difference = 16 - 8
Difference = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to multiply the total population by 3/5. 

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, each female porcupine will give birth to 4 * 12 = 48 babies in a year.

The total number of new porcupines in a year will be the number of female porcupines multiplied by the number of babies each gives birth to in a year. 

Total new porcupines = 30 * 48 = 1440

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the new porcupines.

Total porcupines = 50 + 1440 = 1490

1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need, we do that next.

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon.

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

The final answer is: $826"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

We know there are 9 red sticks. 
There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14. 
The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11. 

Now, we need to find the total number of sticks. 
Total number of sticks = red sticks + blue sticks + yellow sticks 
Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11 
Total number of sticks = 34 

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how far each person traveled, we need to multiply their speed by the time they traveled.

Matteo's distance = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles
Shandy's distance = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we need to find the difference between their distances to see how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo.
Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance
Difference = 450 miles - 220 miles
Difference = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total students: 3000
- Half of the students are over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students
- One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male: 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16 years old
- The remaining students are under 16 years old: 3000 - 1500 = 1500 students
- Half of the students under 16 years old are male: 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16 years old

Now, let's find the number of female students over 16 years old: 1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16 years old
And the number of female students under 16 years old: 1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16 years old

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 years old and under 16 years old: 1125 + 750 = 1875

The final answer is: 1875"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.
5. To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To find out how much water is remaining in the tank, we need to calculate how much water was pumped into the tank and subtract that from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. 

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

So, on the first day, the total amount of water in the tank is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons. On the second day, the total amount of water in the tank is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons. 

The total amount of water in the tank after two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

To find out how much water is remaining in the tank, we subtract the total amount of water from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the initial charge of the power bank was x%.

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining will be x - (9 * 5) = x - 45%.

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining will be (x - 45) - (7 * 3) = x - 45 - 21 = x - 66%.

We are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

x - 66 = 28

To solve for x, we add 66 to both sides of the equation:

x = 28 + 66
x = 94

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%.

The final answer is: 94"
"To find out how much Janet makes in a week, we need to add her wages and tips. She makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so she makes $10 + $15 = $25 an hour. 

Since she works 40 hours a week, she makes $25 * 40 = $1000 a week.

Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10000 car. 20% of $10000 is 0.2 * $10000 = $2000.

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save the down payment, we need to divide the amount she needs to save ($2000) by the amount she makes in a week ($1000). 

$2000 / $1000 = 2.

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to first calculate how much money he has left after buying the other fruits. 

3 peaches cost 3 x $.5 = $1.5
4 pears cost 4 x $.5 = $2
2 kiwis cost 2 x $1 = $2
5 apples cost 5 x $.75 = $3.75

Adding these costs together, we get $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Plums cost $.25 each, so we can divide the money he has left by the cost of a plum to find out how many he can buy: $0.75 / $.25 = 3

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we need to first find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. 

Anne had 15 packs and kept 2, so she gave 15 - 2 = 13 packs to her friends.

Since she gave the packs equally to 10 friends, we need to divide the number of packs by 10. 

13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend. 

Since each pack has 60 pieces, we multiply the number of packs each friend received by 60.

1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces.

So each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 x $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 x $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 x $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."

Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Since 3 albums were selfies only, that means 3 albums have 9 pictures each. 

3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies

And since 2 albums were portraits, that means 2 albums have 9 pictures each. 

2 albums * 9 pictures per album = 18 portraits

So, Olivia had 27 selfies and 18 portraits. 

The final answer is:

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to know how many pages he reads per minute. 

James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find out how many pages he reads per minute, we divide the number of pages by the number of minutes. 

3 pages / 10 minutes = 0.3 pages per minute

Now, we know James reads 0.3 pages per minute. We need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read 18 pages. 

To do this, we divide the number of pages by the number of pages he reads per minute. 

18 pages / 0.3 pages per minute = 60 minutes

So, James spends 60 minutes reading."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The hotel started with 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests left is 100 - 24 = 76.
3. 15 guests checked out late, but this doesn't change the number of guests in the hotel at that moment, it's just a change in checkout time.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30 people.
5. So, the number of guests now is 76 + 30 = 106.
6. 7 more people checked in after dinner, so the final number of guests is 106 + 7 = 113.

"To find out how many points Aries is sure to get, we need to find out how many easy, average, and difficult questions there are, and then multiply the number of each type of question by the percentage Aries is sure to get.

First, let's find out how many easy, average, and difficult questions there are. 

40% of the questions are easy, so the number of easy questions is 40% of 60, which is 0.4 x 60 = 24.

The rest of the questions are equally divided as average and difficult, so there are 60 - 24 = 36 questions left. 

36 questions are divided into 2 types, so each type has 36 / 2 = 18 questions.

Now, let's find out how many points Aries is sure to get from each type of question.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, so she is sure to get 0.75 x 24 = 18 easy questions.

Aries is sure to get half of the average questions, so she is sure to get 0.5 x 18 = 9 average questions.

Aries is sure to get half of the difficult questions, so she is sure to get 0.5 x 18 = 9 difficult questions.

Now, let's add up the number of points Aries is sure to get from each type of question. 

18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say the number of large stuffed animals sold is x. Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x.

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, so the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total amount earned from the sales is $120. The amount earned from the large stuffed animals is $12x, and the amount earned from the small stuffed animals is $4 * 2x = $8x.

The total amount earned is the sum of the amount earned from the large and small stuffed animals, so we can set up the equation:

$12x + $8x = $120

Combine like terms:

$20x = $120

Divide both sides by 20:

x = $120 / $20
x = 6

Since x is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x = 2 * 6 = 12.

"To find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe, we need to know how much he can mine with an iron pickaxe first. 

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. He can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe, so he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

He can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 is 12, so he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now we know that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. To find out how much 40 dwarves can mine in a day, we multiply 36 by 40: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

Since there are 30 days in a month, we multiply 1440 by 30 to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month: 1440 * 30 = 43200.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages, which is $1.5. 

Now, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches in the third package: $1.5 * 8 = $12.

   Total number of balloons = 25 + 7 + 12 = 44

2. 40% of the red balloons burst. 
   Number of red balloons that burst = 40% of 25 = 0.4 x 25 = 10
   Number of red balloons remaining = 25 - 10 = 15
   Total number of balloons = 15 + 7 + 12 = 34

3. Sally released half of the yellow balloons.

"To find the chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the chance that he won't get an extension. 

There's a 50% chance the substitute teacher won't collect the homework. If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 60% chance she won't give an extension (100% - 40%). If the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension, there's a 80% chance Marcus won't get a personal extension (100% - 20%). 

So, the chance that Marcus won't get an extension is 50% + (50% * 60%) + (50% * 60% * 80%). 

First, we calculate 50% * 60% = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3. 
Then, we calculate 50% * 60% * 80% = 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.24. 
Now, we add 50% (0.5) + 0.3 + 0.24 = 0.74. 

To convert 0.74 to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.74 * 100 = 74%.

"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first find out how much she makes in total and then subtract her expenses.

Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so she works a total of 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

She is paid $15 per day, so for 3 days, she makes 15 * 3 = $45.

Her parking expenses are $3 per day, so for 3 days, she pays 3 * 3 = $9.

Now, we subtract her expenses from her total pay: 45 - 9 = $36.

To find out how much she makes per hour, we divide her total pay after expenses by the number of hours she worked: 36 / 18 = $2.

Since the driveway is 24 feet wide and he puts a bottle every 3 feet, we can divide 24 by 3 to find out how many bottles he will place. 

24 / 3 = 8 

So, Richard will place 8 bottles of soda on the driveway. 

It will take him 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, so we need to multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to go to the next one.

"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought. 

2 pounds of Parmesan cheese costs 2 x $11 = $22. 
3 pounds of mozzarella cheese costs 3 x $6 = $18. 
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40. 

Amor starts with $50, so we need to subtract the cost of the cheese from the amount she started with. 
$50 - $40 = $10.

So, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jim gets $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years, so the total amount of loans he gets is:
$50,000 * 4 = $200,000

He also loses money by not working while in school. He had a $25,000 a year job, so for 4 years, he loses:
$25,000 * 4 = $100,000

The total amount of money he needs to earn is the sum of the loans and the money lost:
$200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

After college, his income triples, so he now earns $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.

To find out how long it takes him to earn the $300,000, we can divide the total amount by his new income:
$300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years

So, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To find out how much fabric Jim needs, we need to find the area of the two pieces of fabric. 

First, we need to find the dimensions of the fabric. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. The fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. 

So, the length of the fabric will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet and the width of the fabric will be 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

Now, we need to find the area of one piece of fabric. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying the length and the width. 

Area = length * width
Area = 8 * 10
Area = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we need to multiply the area by 2.

Total area = 2 * 80
Total area = 160 square feet

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered on each day and add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 
So, they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters on Wednesday.

Now, let's add up the number of letters delivered on each day: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

The final answer is: 736"
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.
The cost of the pasta salad is 6 people * $6 per person = $36.

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad together: $65 + $36 = $101.

The final answer is: $101"
"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average, we need to find the total amount he lost and divide it by the number of races.

On the first race, he lost $5.

On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. He lost $5, so twice that is 2 x $5 = $10. $1 more than that is $10 + $1 = $11. But since he won, we add this to the total, not subtract. So, he won $11.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. He won $11, so 1.5 times that is 1.5 x $11 = $16.5. He lost this amount.

Now, let's add up the total amount he lost and won. He lost $5 and $16.5, so that's $5 + $16.5 = $21.5. He won $11, so we add that to the total: $21.5 + $11 = $32.5.

He lost on 2 out of 3 races, so we divide the total amount he lost by the number of races he lost: $21.5 / 2 = $10.75.

The final answer is: $10.75"
"To find the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then multiply that by the number of people in each city.

Number of countries: 26
Number of cities in each country: 5
Number of people in each city: 1000

First, multiply the number of cities by the number of people in each city: 5 * 1000 = 5000
Then, multiply the result by the number of countries: 26 * 5000 = 130,000

The final answer is: 130,000"
"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we need to first find their current heights. 

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is 4 x 12 = 48 inches. Adding the 3 inches he grew, Xavier's current height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches. So, Cole's current height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height. The difference is 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say the first person took x dollars. 
The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person took x + 80 dollars. 
The third person took twice what the second took, so the third person took 2(x + 80) dollars.

We know that the total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: 
x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms: 
x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920
Combine x terms: 
4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides: 
4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4: 
x = 420

The first person took $420."
"To find the total hours each painter worked, we need to first find the total hours they worked in 3 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 x 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to find 3/8ths of 21 days. 

To do this, we multiply 21 by 3/8. To multiply a fraction by a whole number, we multiply the numerator (3) by the whole number (21) and keep the denominator (8) the same. 

So, 21 x 3 = 63. 

Now we have 63/8. To divide by 8, we can multiply by 1/8. 

63 x 1/8 = 63/8. 

To simplify this, we can divide the numerator (63) by the denominator (8). 

63 ÷ 8 = 7.875. 

So, they worked 7.875 days. 

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply 7.875 by 24 to find the total hours they worked. 

7.875 x 24 = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to find the hours each painter worked. 

189 ÷ 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's say the number of balls retrieved in the second set is x. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x / 2.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19.

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying the whole equation by 2, which gives us: 2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38.

Now we can simplify the equation: 2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38.

Combine like terms: 5x + 8 = 38.

Subtract 8 from both sides: 5x = 30.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 6.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set: x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

In 2008, the price of the car depreciates by 21% of $20000, which is 0.21 x $20000 = $4200. 
The price of the car in 2008 is $20000 - $4200 = $15800.

In 2009, the price of the car depreciates by 21% of $15800, which is 0.21 x $15800 = $3328.
The price of the car in 2009 is $15800 - $3328 = $12472.

In 2010, the price of the car depreciates by 21% of $12472, which is 0.21 x $12472 = $2620.52.
The price of the car in 2010 is $12472 - $2620.52 = $9841.48.

The price of the car in 2010 is $9841.48."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that half of the books are written in English. So, half of 50 is 50 / 2 = 25 books written in English.

Next, we know that 10% of the books are written in German. To find 10% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.1 (since 10% is the same as 0.1). So, 50 * 0.1 = 5 books written in German.

Now, we know that the total number of books is 50, and 25 are in English and 5 are in German. To find the number of books written in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books. 

50 (total books) - 25 (English books) - 5 (German books) = 20 books written in Spanish.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she already drove from the total distance. 

Total distance = 1955 kilometers
Distance driven by Bernice = 325 kilometers

Distance left to drive = Total distance - Distance driven by Bernice
= 1955 - 325
= 1630 kilometers

"To find out how many gallons Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. To find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days, we multiply 8 cups by 30 days. 

8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Now, we need to find out how many gallons are in 240 cups. We know that there are 16 cups in a gallon. To find out how many gallons are in 240 cups, we divide 240 cups by 16 cups/gallon.

240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Romeo boards the train with 120 people.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes 120 + 20 = 140.
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train. So, the number of people left on the train is 140 - 50 = 90.
   Then, twice the number of people who descended (which is 2 * 50 = 100) board the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes 90 + 100 = 190.
4. At the third station, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the number of people left on the train is 190 - 80 = 110.

"To find out how much Alison spent, we need to add up the cost of all the items she bought.

1. The tank top cost $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks cost $8, but she had a coupon for $2 off, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: 
$10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55.

The final answer is: $55"
"To find the total cost, we need to find the total number of tiles needed and multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, we need to find the area of one tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1ft, the area of one tile is 1ft * 1ft = 1 SqFt.

Now, we need to find the total number of tiles needed. We can do this by dividing the total area of the kitchen floor (200 SqFt) by the area of one tile (1 SqFt). 

200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile ($12).

200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find out how much James pays a year, we need to first find out how much he pays a month. 

The normal cost is $120 a month. Since he had an accident, it's 60% more than normal. 

60% of $120 is 0.6 x 120 = $72. 

So, the cost after the accident is $120 + $72 = $192 a month.

To find out how much he pays a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12. 

$192 x 12 = $2304.

The final answer is: $2304"
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to find out how many sets of sheets he has to wash in a week. 

He has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed. Since he puts clean sheets on all of them every week, he has 4 + 1 = 5 sets of sheets to wash every week.

Since his laundry machine can only wash 2 twin sets or 1 king set at a time, we need to find out how many loads he does for the twin beds and the king bed separately. 

For the twin beds, he has 4 sets of sheets to wash. Since he can only wash 2 sets at a time, he will have to do 4 / 2 = 2 loads for the twin beds.

For the king bed, he has 1 set of sheets to wash. Since he can only wash 1 king set at a time, he will have to do 1 load for the king bed.

So, in total, he does 2 loads for the twin beds and 1 load for the king bed, which is 2 + 1 = 3 loads of laundry every week.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, he does 3 loads of laundry every week. To find out how many loads he does in a year, we multiply 3 loads/week by 52 weeks/year. 

3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

"To find out how many movies Jill and her friends watch in a week, we need to know how many movies they watch on Saturday and Sunday. 

They watch 4 movies on Saturday. 
They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday, so they watch 4 / 2 = 2 movies on Sunday.

So, in a week, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

If they watch movies every weekend for 4 weeks, they will watch 6 * 4 = 24 movies.

"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount of cat food Imma feeds her cats each day (60 grams).

First, we need to find out how much cat food Imma feeds her cats in a day. Since she feeds her cats twice a day, we multiply 60 grams by 2.

60 grams * 2 = 120 grams

Now, we divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the daily amount (120 grams).

720 grams / 120 grams = 6

So, the cat food will last for 6 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake did, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

We also know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake did, so Silvia ate 2 x 7 = 14 slices.

Now, let's find the total number of slices eaten by all three. We know that each pizza had 8 slices and there were 4 pizzas, so the total number of slices is 8 x 4 = 32.

However, we already know that Becky, Jake, and Silvia ate 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices. Since there are 32 slices in total, we can conclude that they ate all the slices.

"Let's say Donovan's part took x minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.

The total time it took to make the meal is the sum of Betsy's and Donovan's parts, which is 98 minutes. So we can write an equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

So Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 x 80 = 16 emails. 

So, James doesn't respond to 16 emails. 

To find out how many emails he responds to, we need to subtract 16 from 80. 

80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Now, we need to find out how many emails James responds to in a 5 day work week. 

Since James gets 80 emails a day, in 5 days he gets 80 x 5 = 400 emails.

Out of those 400 emails, he responds to 64. 

So, in a 5 day work week, James responds to 64 emails."

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 40 x 0.8 = 32 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 (by the glee club) + 32 (by the football team) = 46 pizzas.

To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to subtract the total number of pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered. The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and the football team ordered 40 pizzas, so they ordered a total of 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas.

60 - 46 = 14 pizzas left."

Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons. He is sending twice as many big coupons, so he is sending 2 x 700 = 1400 big coupons.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 x 5 cents = 3500 cents.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 x 15 cents = 21000 cents.

Now, we add the cost of mailing small and big coupons together: 3500 + 21000 = 23500 cents.

6 dozen croissants * 1 pound of butter per dozen = 6 pounds of butter

Since the store has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half off, we need to calculate the total cost of 6 pounds of butter. 

For the first pound, the cost is $4.00. 
For the second pound, the cost is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00 (since it's half off)
For the third pound, the cost is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00 (since it's half off)
For the fourth pound, the cost is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00 (since it's half off)
For the fifth pound, the cost is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00 (since it's half off)
For the sixth pound, the cost is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00 (since it's half off)

Now, we add up the costs of all the pounds of butter:

"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that one monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day. 

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day. 

Since Mr. Robles has 315 bananas for the week, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is 315 bananas. 

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats in a week and then divide that by 7. 

Since the first two monkeys eat 24 bananas each day, the third monkey eats 315 - 24 * 7 = 315 - 168 = 147 bananas in a week.

Since roses cost $2 each, 15 roses will cost 15 x 2 = $30. 

However, the florist also offers a dozen roses for $15. Since 12 roses are in a dozen, we can buy 12 roses for $15. 

So, 15 roses can be bought as 12 roses for $15 and 3 roses for $6 (3 x 2 = 6). 

The total cost of 15 roses is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is a total of 5 x 5 = $25.

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she paid with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to find out how many quarters are in $4. 

There are 4 quarters in $1, so there are 4 x 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

Jenny leaves with 16 quarters."
"To find the total money Terry makes, we need to calculate the money he makes from each item and add them together.

First, let's calculate the money he makes from milkshakes: 
6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = 6 * 5.50 = $33

Next, let's calculate the money he makes from burger platters: 
9 burger platters * $11 each = 9 * 11 = $99

Then, let's calculate the money he makes from sodas: 
20 sodas * $1.50 each = 20 * 1.50 = $30

Now, let's add the money he makes from each item together: 
$33 + $99 + $30 = $162

The final answer is: $162"
"To find out how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time he has to wait from the moment he arrives at the station until the fourth train arrives.

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station after 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station. Since the first train leaves the station after 30 minutes, the second train arrives 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after Paul arrives at the station.

The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station after 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station. Since the second train leaves the station after 65 minutes, the third train arrives 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after Paul arrives at the station.

The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it doesn't add any extra time to the total waiting time.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. Since the third train arrives at 125 minutes, the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after Paul arrives at the station.

So, Paul will wait for 145 minutes for his train.

The final answer is: 145"
"To find out how many more weeks Melanie needs to save toothpicks, we need to know how many toothpicks she has saved so far. 

Melanie saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. To find the total number of toothpicks she saved, we multiply the number of toothpicks she saved each week by the number of weeks: 
10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to save to reach 200 toothpicks. We subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total number of toothpicks needed: 
200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks. We divide the number of toothpicks she needs to save by the number of toothpicks she saves each week: 
80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the discount percentage, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, so he paid 75% of $2000. 

75% of $2000 = 0.75 * $2000 = $1500

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. So, he sold it at 120% of $1500.

120% of $1500 = 1.2 * $1500 = $1800

Now, we need to find the discount percentage obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend. To do this, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price at which the friend bought it, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100.

Discount percentage = ((Original price - Price at which friend bought it) / Original price) * 100
= (($2000 - $1800) / $2000) * 100
= ($200 / $2000) * 100
= 0.1 * 100
= 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many jellyfish 5 springs create in 4 hours, we need to know how many seconds are in 4 hours. 

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in 4 hours. 

60 seconds * 60 minutes = 3600 seconds in 1 hour
3600 seconds * 4 hours = 14400 seconds in 4 hours

Now, we know that each spring creates a new jellyfish every second. So, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create 14400 jellyfish. 

Since there are 5 springs, we multiply the number of jellyfish created by one spring by 5. 

14400 jellyfish * 5 springs = 72000 jellyfish

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first find twice Binkie's score. Binkie's score is 90, so twice that is 2 x 90 = 180. 

Then, we need to add 15 to that number to find Frankie's score. 180 + 15 = 195.

Frankie's score was 195."
"To find out how long it took James to reach the store, we need to first find out how long it took him to walk to the halfway point, and then add the time it took him to walk back home.

The distance to the halfway point is 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles. 

Since James walks 4 miles per hour, it took him 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours to walk to the halfway point.

Then, he walked back home, which is the same distance, so it also took him 0.5 hours.

So, the total time it took James to reach the store is 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours = 1 hour.

"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to first find out how much she would have paid if she bought the bananas individually and then subtract the cost of the bunches from that.

If Jenny bought the bananas individually, she would have bought 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas. Each banana costs $0.80, so 40 bananas would cost 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Jenny bought 10 bunches for $3.00 each, so she paid 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money she saved, we subtract the cost of the bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Let's say Sam gets x feet of the fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet. 

Since they have 100 feet of fence in total, we can write an equation: x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to know how many inches it grows per year. 

We know the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find out how many inches it grows per year, we divide 8 by 4. 

8 / 4 = 2 inches per year.

Now, we need to find out how many inches it will grow in 13 years. We multiply the number of inches it grows per year by the number of years. 

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.

The final answer is: 26"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Half of them were Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes
- 15% were BMX bikes: 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes
- The rest of the sold bikes were MTB type: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes

Now, let's find the total earnings from each type of bike:
- Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 (half of $500) = 45 * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the earnings from all types of bikes:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"Let's break it down step by step.

The farmer makes 5 bales of hay per hour. If they work for 6 hours, they will make 5 * 6 = 30 bales of hay.

The truck picks up 3 bales of hay per hour. If the truck works for 6 hours, it will pick up 3 * 6 = 18 bales of hay.

To find out how many bales are left in the field, we need to subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the total number of bales made by the farmer. 

So, 30 (total bales made) - 18 (bales picked up) = 12 bales left in the field.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many minutes John spends in class, we need to multiply the number of periods he has, the number of extra classes, and the length of each class. 

6 periods + 2 extra classes = 8 classes
8 classes * 40 minutes per class = 320 minutes per day

Since John goes to school for 5 days a week, we multiply the minutes per day by 5.

320 minutes per day * 5 days per week = 1600 minutes per week

Now, we need to find out how many minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday. 1/16 of his weekly minutes is spent on these days. 

1/16 * 1600 minutes per week = 100 minutes per day

Since there are 2 days, we multiply the minutes per day by 2.

100 minutes per day * 2 days = 200 minutes

Now, we add the minutes spent in class and the minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday.

1600 minutes per week + 200 minutes per week = 1800 minutes per week

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60.

1800 minutes per week / 60 = 30 hours per week

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to find out how high it goes on its first bounce and then multiply that by 2/3.

The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony, so it starts at 3 * 24 = 72 feet high.

On the first bounce, it goes to 2/3 of its starting height, so it goes 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet high.

On the second bounce, it goes to 2/3 of its previous height, so it goes 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet high.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to find the height of each child first.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 6 feet to inches by multiplying 6 by 12. 

6 feet * 12 inches/foot = 72 inches

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so we add 2 inches to the height of the first child.

72 inches + 2 inches = 74 inches

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so we subtract 5 inches from the height of the second child.

74 inches - 5 inches = 69 inches

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so we add 3 inches to the height of the third child.

69 inches + 3 inches = 72 inches

The fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to know how many bags of apples they sold. Since they sold 2000 apples and each bag has 10 apples, we can divide 2000 by 10 to find the number of bags.

2000 ÷ 10 = 200

So, the orchard sold 200 bags of apples. 

Now, we need to multiply the number of bags by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. 
2. Before the Allosaurus, the velociraptors ate half of what was left. So, the velociraptors ate half of (x - 270), where x is the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate. 
3. This means the velociraptors ate (x - 270)/2 kilograms of meat.
4. Before the velociraptors, the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. So, the T-Rex ate x/2 kilograms of meat.
5. The total weight of the triceratops is the sum of what the T-Rex ate, what the velociraptors ate, and what the Allosaurus ate. 
6. So, we can write the equation: x/2 + (x - 270)/2 + 270 = x

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to find the total area of the walls and then divide it by the area one gallon of paint can cover. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their area is 10 x 8 = 80 square feet each. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their area is 5 x 8 = 40 square feet each. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area of the room is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since one gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need to divide the total area by 20 to find out how many gallons we need. 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

One gallon of paint costs $12, so 12 gallons will cost 12 x 12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to find out how many shaken sodas are left and how many cans are left in total.

Ellen started with 12 sodas and shook 3 of them. So, 3 sodas are shaken and 9 are unshaken. 

Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, so now there are 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas left.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas. So, there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left.

Now, Ellen's friend is left with 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas. 

The likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans. 

2 (shaken cans) / 8 (total cans) = 0.25

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100.

0.25 * 100 = 25%

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

One train is traveling 60 miles per hour. The other train is traveling half that distance per hour, so it's traveling 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add their speeds together to find their relative speed. So, their relative speed is 60 + 30 = 90 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find the distance they traveled in 3 hours. We can multiply their relative speed by the time they traveled: 90 miles per hour * 3 hours = 270 miles.

So, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find out how many people Billy helps, we need to first find out how many days he works. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50 days. 

Billy takes 20% of the days off, so we need to find 20% of 50. 20% is the same as 0.2, so we multiply 50 by 0.2 to get 10. 

This means Billy takes 10 days off. So, he works 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he can help 2 x 3 = 6 people per day.

To find out how many people he helps in total, we multiply the number of days he works by the number of people he helps per day. So, 40 x 6 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find out how many people were inside the church, we need to find out how many people were outside the church and then subtract that number from the total number of people. 

First, let's find out how many people were in the buses. There were 12 buses and each bus carried 35 people. 

12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Next, let's find out how many people were in the cars. There were 20 cars and each car carried 3 people.

20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars to find out how many people were outside the church.

420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the number of people outside the church from the total number of people. However, the question does not provide the total number of people. 

But we can assume that the total number of people is the sum of the people in the buses and the people in the cars plus the people inside the church. 

Let's call the number of people inside the church 'x'. Then, the total number of people is 480 (outside) + x (inside).

The total number of people is also equal to the sum of the people in the buses and the people in the cars. 

So, we can write the equation: 480 + x = 420 + 60

Simplifying the equation, we get: 480 + x = 480

Subtracting 480 from both sides, we get: x = 0

So, the number of people inside the church is 0."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old. So, Martha's age is 24 - 4 = 20 years old.

Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, and Martha is 20 years old. So, Jeff's age is 20 + 10 = 30 years old.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how long it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of each slide by the speed of the slide.

For the biggest slide: 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes
For the second biggest slide: 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the two slides. 
5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

"To find the total time Bobby takes for lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time for 5 days.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch per day. 
30 minutes * 5 days = 150 minutes

Bobby takes 2 15-minute breaks per day. 
2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes
30 minutes * 5 days = 150 minutes

Total time for lunch and breaks = 150 minutes (lunch) + 150 minutes (breaks) = 300 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60.
300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we need to know how many miles Micah ran first. 

Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. Amber ran 8 miles. So, Micah ran 3.5 x 8 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that Amber and Micah ran 8 + 28 = 36 miles in total. 

Since they ran 52 miles in total, Ahito must have run 52 - 36 = 16 miles.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we need to subtract the cost of the item she returned from the initial charge: 
   $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

2. Then, we need to find the discount on the frying pan. The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. 
   20% of $20.00 is 0.2 x $20.00 = $4.00
   So, the sale price of the frying pan is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

3. Next, we need to find the discount on the set of towels. The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. 
   10% of $30.00 is 0.1 x $30.00 = $3.00
   So, the sale price of the set of towels is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

4. Now, we need to add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the new balance after the return: 
   $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say the total number of jellyfish in the tank is x.

A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue, so the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We know that when the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. This means that the number of large jellyfish that change color is 6. So, we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

The final answer is: 90"

"To find out how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate how much she needs to save for retirement and then divide that by her annual savings.

First, let's find out how much Lauren will need for retirement. She plans to live on 40% of her current salary, which is 0.4 x $100,000 = $40,000 per year. For 20 years, she will need 20 x $40,000 = $800,000.

Lauren saves 20% of her salary, which is 0.2 x $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

To find out how many years she needs to work, we divide the total amount she needs for retirement by her annual savings: $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

However, Lauren has already worked for some years, but we don't know how many. Let's assume she has worked for x years. In that case, she has saved x x $20,000 = $20,000x dollars.

The number of years she needs to work is 40 - x.

The problem is asking how many more years she needs to work, so the answer is 40 - x.

Unfortunately, we don't know the value of x, so we can't give a numerical answer."
"To find out how long each final cut will be, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts it will be cut into. 

First, we divide the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. 
100 cm / 4 = 25 cm per part.

Then, we divide each of these 4 parts into 5 equal parts. 
25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut.

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long."
"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to divide the number of boys by the percentage of boys. 

First, we need to convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100. 40% is the same as 40/100, which is 0.4. 

Now, we can divide the number of boys (240) by the decimal (0.4) to find the total number of students in the school. 

240 / 0.4 = 600

Now that we know the total number of students, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students. 

600 - 240 = 360

So, there are 360 girls in the school."

"To find the average height of heels, we need to add up the total height of all the heels and divide it by the total number of women.

The three women wearing 4 inch heels have a total height of 3 x 4 = 12 inches.
The three women wearing 2 inch heels have a total height of 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.
There are 6 women in total.

To find the average height, we divide the total height by the total number of women: 18 / 6 = 3.

"To find out how many more miles Soledad needs to hike per day, we need to first find out how many miles she will hike in total in 30 days. 

She will hike 125 miles twice a day, so that's 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day. 

In 30 days, she will hike 250 * 30 = 7500 miles. 

Since she wants to hike 9,300 miles, we need to find out how many miles she is short. 

9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 miles. 

Now, we need to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day to cover 1,800 miles in 30 days. 

1,800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles per day. 

So, Soledad needs to hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's call this number ""A"". 

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted ""S"". Then, Camden painted S + 12 eggs.

Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we can write the equation: S + (S + 12) = 30

Combine like terms: 2S + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2S = 18

Divide both sides by 2: S = 9

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs. Since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. We also know that Camden painted 21 eggs. Let's call the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline ""T"". Then, T + 21 + 9 = 56 (since Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, and Arnold and Madeline painted T eggs).

Combine like terms: T + 30 = 56

Subtract 30 from both sides: T = 26

So, Arnold and Madeline painted 26 eggs each. 

The question asks how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Since Camden painted 21 eggs and Arnold painted 26 eggs, Camden painted 21 - 26 = -5 eggs more than Arnold."
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to find the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes, then add them together.

First, let's find the total weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So, the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

Next, let's find the total weight of the boxes. Nik has 200 crayons and he puts them into groups of 8. So, he needs 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces. So, the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, let's add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes. 200 + 200 = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, we need to divide the total weight in ounces by 16 to find the total weight in pounds. 400 / 16 = 25.

"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to find 80% of 80 feet. 80% is the same as 0.8. 

0.8 x 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet, we need to divide 64 by 4 to find out how many logs he can make.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

Now, we need to find out how many planks he can make from each log. Since each log makes 5 planks, we multiply the number of logs by 5.

16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

Now, we need to find out how much money he makes from selling the planks. Since each plank is sold for $1.2, we multiply the number of planks by the price of each plank.

80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Valerie earns $5000 per month. Her brother earns 2 times what Valerie earns, so her brother earns 2 x $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so their mother earns 2 x $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to add their salaries. $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach.

Let's say her speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she spends 40 minutes on the beach. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach, her speed on the beach is 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

Now we know that her speed on the beach is 0.05 miles per minute, so her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 0.05 = 0.1 miles per minute.

Now we know her speed on the sidewalk, we can find the time it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. Time = Distance / Speed = 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

Now we know that she spends 40 minutes on the beach and 10 minutes on the sidewalk, so the total time she spends on the beach and sidewalk is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

Since the total walk is 3 miles, and she spends 50 minutes on the beach and sidewalk, the time she spends on the remaining 1 mile is 3 - 2 = 1 mile on the sidewalk, which we already know is 10 minutes. 

So the total time for the entire 3-mile walk is 50 + 10 = 60 minutes.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save $60, we need to know how much she has saved so far and how much more she needs to save.

Jane has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so we multiply 4 by 8 to find out how much she has saved so far: 
4 x 8 = 32

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60. We subtract the amount she has saved so far from the total amount she wants to save:
60 - 32 = 28

Since she saves $4 per week, we need to find out how many weeks it will take to save $28. We divide 28 by 4:
28 / 4 = 7

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60. 

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree.

3 trees had 7 blue birds each, so that's 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.
2 trees had 4 blue birds each, so that's 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.
1 tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add all the blue birds together: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's break this problem down step by step.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles and has 60 marbles, we need to find out how many marbles he had initially. Since 1 dozen is 12, 2 dozen is 2 x 12 = 24. 

So, if he has 60 marbles after receiving 2 dozen more, we can subtract 24 from 60 to find out how many marbles he had initially. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we know Bob had 36 marbles initially. If he loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from 36.

36 - 10 = 26

So, Bob will have 26 marbles.

The final answer is: 26"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Donny has two mugs of water. One is 33 degrees and the other is unknown. He pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle. 

Since he can now drink the water, the temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. 

Let's say the unknown mug has x degrees. When he pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the x-degree mug, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the two temperatures multiplied by the total ounces. 

The total ounces of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the x-degree mug). 

The average temperature of the two mugs is (33 + x) / 2. 

The total temperature of the water in the bottle is (33 + x) / 2 * 5. 

Since he can now drink the water, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. There are 7 days in a week, so in 3 weeks, there are 3 x 7 = 21 days. 

The number of cows added by Milkie Cows Limited in 21 days is 20 x 21 = 420 cows. 

So, the total number of cows is 50 + 420 = 470 cows.

Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. The number of chickens added by Broilers Limited in 21 days is 10 x 21 = 210 chickens.

So, the total number of chickens is 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

The total number of animals on the farm is 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

"To find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels, we need to multiply the cost of one pack by 4. 

Cost of one pack = $10.00
Total cost of 4 packs = $10.00 * 4 = $40.00

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $40.00 and subtract it from the total cost.

10% of $40.00 = 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00
Discounted cost = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Now, we need to find the total number of bagels in 4 packs. 

Number of bagels in one pack = 9
Total number of bagels in 4 packs = 9 * 4 = 36

To find the cost of one bagel, we need to divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels.

Cost of one bagel = $36.00 / 36 = $1.00"
"To find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate, we need to know how many scoops 1 potato makes. 

First, let's find out how many scoops 1 potato makes. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes make 1 less than 3 scoops. 1 less than 3 scoops is 2 scoops. So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops. 

Now, we know 3 potatoes make 2 scoops. To find out how many scoops 1 potato makes, we need to divide 2 scoops by 3 potatoes. 2 scoops / 3 potatoes = 2/3 scoops per potato.

Now, we know Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, Gomer ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate. We know 1 potato makes 2/3 scoops. To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to divide the total scoops by 2/3. 

To divide by a fraction, we multiply by the reciprocal of the fraction. The reciprocal of 2/3 is 3/2. So, we multiply 18 scoops by 3/2. 

18 scoops * 3/2 = 18 * 3 / 2 = 54 / 2 = 27.

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"To find out how many eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in 30 days is 3 x 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in 30 days is 5 x 30 = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs he eats in both periods: 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs: 240 / 12 = 20.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know there are 17 green jellybeans. Then, there are twice as many red jellybeans, so there are 17 x 2 = 34 red jellybeans.

Now, we know the total number of jellybeans is 60. We already know that 17 + 34 = 51 jellybeans are either green or red. 

To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans. 

60 (total jellybeans) - 51 (green and red jellybeans) = 9 blue jellybeans.

First, let's find out how many lemons Tim gets in a year. He has 5 trees and each tree gives him 6 lemons. 

5 trees * 6 lemons = 30 lemons per year

Now, we multiply the number of lemons he gets in a year by 10 to find out how many lemons he gets in a decade.

30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

"To find the number of women on the bus, we need to first find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 9 = 14. 

The fraction of the total number of passengers that are women is 9/14. 

To find the number of women on the bus, we multiply the fraction by the total number of passengers: (9/14) * 84 = 54.

Now, 20 women alight from the bus. To find the number of women remaining, we subtract 20 from 54: 54 - 20 = 34.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Faraday earns $26 from the sunflowers per day. Since each sunflower costs $2, we can find out how many sunflowers he sells per day by dividing the amount he earns from sunflowers by the cost of one sunflower.

Number of sunflowers sold per day = $26 / $2 = 13

Faraday also earns $56 from the bouquets per day. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers and costs $8, we can find out how many bouquets he sells per day by dividing the amount he earns from bouquets by the cost of one bouquet.

Number of bouquets sold per day = $56 / $8 = 7

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:

Total sunflowers in bouquets per day = 7 * 12 = 84

Now, we need to find the total number of sunflowers sold per day. We add the number of sunflowers sold individually and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day.

Total sunflowers sold per day = 13 + 84 = 97

Since we want to know the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days, we multiply the total sunflowers sold per day by 3.

Total sunflowers sold in 3 days = 97 * 3 = 291

He sells 60% of his inventory, which is 60% of 20 rocks. To find 60% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.6:

20 x 0.6 = 12 rocks

He sells each rock for $7, so we multiply the number of rocks he sells by the price of each rock:

12 x $7 = $84

Now we know Adam makes $84, but we need to find out how much he loses. To do that, we subtract the money he makes from the money he started with:

$100 - $84 = $16

So Adam loses $16."
"To find out how many days it will take Lauren to create all the picture scenes, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of large, medium, and small-sized scenes she can draw per day.

First, let's find the LCM of 5, 6, and 7. 

The multiples of 5 are: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145, 150, 155, 160, 165, 170, 175, 180, 185, 190, 195,

"To find out how many eggs each child gets, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children.

A dozen is 12 eggs, so Chatty prepared 3 dozen eggs. 
3 dozen eggs = 3 x 12 = 36 eggs

There are 4 children. 
36 eggs / 4 children = 9 eggs per child

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to know how many days are in May. May has 31 days. 

Since each fish needs $1 worth of food a day, and Jen has 3 fish, she needs to spend $1 * 3 = $3 per day on food for her fish.

To find out how much she spends in May, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

So, Jen spends $93 on food for her fish in May.

$93"
"To find out how many roses Patricia has now, we need to do some math.

First, Patricia had 30 roses. Then she gave 24 roses to her mother, so we need to subtract 24 from 30. 

30 - 24 = 6

Now Patricia has 6 roses. Then she bought 15 more roses, so we need to add 15 to 6.

6 + 15 = 21

So, Patricia now has 21 roses.

"To find the average speed, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

The total distance traveled is 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

The total time taken is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time. 

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours
Average speed = 50 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probability of the first ticket winning by the probability of the second ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.2 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 times the probability of the first ticket. 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of both tickets winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"Let's break it down step by step.

1. Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

2. Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. So, Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

3. Now we know that Jim collected 27, Carlos collected 22, and Carrey collected 11. 

4. They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. To find the total number of seashells, we add the number of seashells each person collected: 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.

5. Now, we divide the total number of seashells (60) by the number of people (3) to find out how many each person got: 60 / 3 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and then add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). 
4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

He eats 5 carrots each on 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday).
5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Now, let's add the carrots he eats on weekdays and weekend days.
20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots

So, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week."
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to find the length of the second song first. 

The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find 60% of the first song, we multiply 5 minutes by 0.6 (which is 60% as a decimal). 

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

Now, we add the 3 minutes to the first song to find the length of the second song. 

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we add the length of the first song and the second song to find the total time of the cassette.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"Let's break it down step by step.

Linus buys a mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount of the original price, which is 2 x $20 = $40.

He bought 2 devices last Monday, so his cost for Monday is 2 x $20 = $40.
He sold 2 devices last Monday, so his revenue for Monday is 2 x $40 = $80.

He bought 4 devices last Tuesday, so his cost for Tuesday is 4 x $20 = $80.
He sold 4 devices last Tuesday, so his revenue for Tuesday is 4 x $40 = $160.

Total revenue = $80 + $160 = $240
Total cost = $40 + $80 = $120

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $240 - $120 = $120

The final answer is: $120"

2. Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall.
3. Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, so Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall.
4. Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so the length of the cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to first find out how many bottles are needed for 2300 people. 

Since each juice can cover 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, we need to find out how many bottles are needed for 100% of 1 person's daily energy demand. 

100% of 1 person's daily energy demand is 100 / 20 = 5 bottles. 

Now, we need to find out how many bottles are needed for 2300 people. 2300 people will need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles. 

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many days it will take to produce 11500 bottles. 

11500 / 4200 = 2.74 days. 

However, we are asked how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce, not how many days it will take. 

To find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce, we need to find out how many bottles it will produce in 2.74 days. 

2.74 * 4200 = 11496. 

So, Hortex needs to produce 11500 - 11496 = 4 more bottles."
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to know how many babies are wearing purple bows and how many babies are wearing bows in total.

First, let's find out how many babies are wearing purple. Carla has 8 babies and 3/4 of them are wearing purple. 

3/4 * 8 = 6 babies are wearing purple.

Now, let's find out how many babies are wearing purple bows. 1/3 of the purple babies are wearing bows. 

1/3 * 6 = 2 babies are wearing purple bows.

Next, let's find out how many babies are wearing bows in total. We know 1/4 of the babies are wearing blue and 1/3 of the purple babies are wearing bows. So, 1/3 of the purple babies and 1/4 of the blue babies are wearing bows. 

1/3 * 6 = 2 babies are wearing purple bows (we already know this)
1/4 * 2 = 0.5 babies are wearing blue bows (but since we can't have half a baby, we'll round down to 0 babies wearing blue bows, because you can't have a fraction of a baby)

So, 2 babies are wearing bows in total.

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. 

(2 babies wearing purple bows / 2 babies wearing bows) * 100 = 100%

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many reports they received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, and then subtract that number from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

First, let's find the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday. 

Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Now, let's add the reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the reports received on Thursday and Friday. 
Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 1907 + 2136 = 4043

Now, let's subtract the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received last week to find the number of reports received on Wednesday.
Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

The final answer is: 1125"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.

He sold half of the land for $50. Half of 80 is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Now, he has 80 - 40 = 40 square meters left.

He then sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 square meters. So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.

Now, he has 40 - 10 = 30 square meters left.

He then sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, he sold 30 square meters for 30 x $3 = $90.

To find the total amount of money he earned, we need to add the money he earned from each sale. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $90 from the third sale. 

$50 + $30 + $90 = $170

The final answer is: $170"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. Haley is 26 years old, so half of 26 is 26 / 2 = 13.

Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, so we need to subtract 10 from 13. 

13 - 10 = 3

So Geb is 3 years old.

"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to know how many face masks he uses in a day and then multiply it by 2.

Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times every time he goes out, and he goes out 3 times a day. 

So, face masks used in a day = 2 * 3 = 6

Now, we need to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days. 

Face masks used in 2 days = 6 * 2 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Lamar finds 5 eggs.
2. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 x 5 = 10 eggs.
3. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
4. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.
5. Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by all of them: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.
6. Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we need to convert 3 dozen to a number: 1 dozen = 12, so 3 dozen = 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.
7. To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to find out how many apartments he collects from and multiply it by the number of collections he makes in a week and the pay per collection.

First, let's find out how many apartments the first two complexes have. 
200 + 200 = 400 apartments

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. 
60% of 400 is 0.6 x 400 = 240
So the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments

Now, let's add up the total number of apartments John collects from.
400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place. 
So, the total number of collections he makes in a week is 3 x 3 = 9 collections

He gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment. 
So, the total amount he makes in a week is 1440 x 0.40 x 9 = $518.40

The final answer is: $518.40"
"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree, we need to calculate the fruits produced each year and add them up.

- Year 1: 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
- Year 2: 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- Year 3: 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- Year 4: 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, a 10-year-old tree produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. So, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
- Year 5: The tree is now 9 years old, so it's the same as the 8-year-old tree, which is 800 fruits.
- Year 6: The tree is 10 years old, so it produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.
- Year 7: The tree is 11 years old, but we only care about the first 10 years, so we don't count this year.
- Year 8: The tree is 12 years old, but we only care about the first 10 years, so we don't count this year.
- Year 9: The tree is 13 years old, but we only care about the first 10 years, so we don't count this year.
- Year 10: The tree is 14 years old, but we only care about the first 10 years, so we don't count this year.

Now, let's add up the fruits produced each year: 
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 800 + 1000 = 2350

The final answer is: 2350"
"To find out how much money Jack has now, we need to know how much money Sophia gave him. Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100. 

1/5 of $100 is $100 / 5 = $20. 

So, Sophia gave Jack $20. 

Jack had $100 initially and Sophia gave him $20. 

$100 + $20 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say the length of the yellow rope is Y. 
The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so its length is Y - 7. 
The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so its length is 4 * (Y - 7). 

The total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write an equation: 
Y + (Y - 7) + 4 * (Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms: 
Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37
Combine Y terms: 
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides: 
6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6: 
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope: 
Blue rope = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope: 
Red rope = 4 * (Y - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."
"Let's break it down step by step.

Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so if Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 x $5 = $15.

After they both gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount they gave x. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

We know that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money, so we can set up the equation:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

5 * ($15 - x) = 4 * $15
$75 - 5x = $60

Now, let's isolate x by subtracting $75 from both sides:

-5x = -$15

Divide both sides by -5:

x = $3

So, Ronnie gave $3 to their little sister. Now, let's find out how much money Ronnie has left:

$5 - $3 = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, let's call the amount of each of these colors ""x"". 

The total amount of paint used for red, white, and purple is 3x. 

Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints. 

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so the sum of the paint used for red, white, purple, and yellow is 12. 

We can write an equation: 3x + 6 = 12 

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation: 

3x = 12 - 6 
3x = 6 

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x: 

x = 6 / 3 
x = 2 

Since x is the amount of red, white, and purple paint, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to find the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom: 
Area of one bedroom = length * width = 20 * 12 = 240 square feet

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms = 4 * 240 = 960 square feet

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area = 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add them together to find the total area of the house:
Total area = area of bedrooms + area of living room + area of the rest of the house
Total area = 960 + 1200 + 1000
Total area = 3160 square feet

The final answer is: 3160"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds. 
On Tuesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Monday, so she counts 3 * 2 = 6 clouds. 
On Wednesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Tuesday, so she counts 6 * 2 = 12 clouds. 
On Thursday, she counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so she counts 12 * 2 = 24 clouds. 
On Friday, she counts double the number of clouds from Thursday, so she counts 24 * 2 = 48 clouds. 

Now, let's add up all the clouds she counted: 
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box, we need to know how many pods are in the new box. 

The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. 20% of 100 is 0.2 x 100 = 20. So the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now we know the new box has 120 pods and it costs $12. To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the number of pods by the cost. 

First, we need to find out how many pods you can get for $1. We can do this by dividing the total number of pods by the cost of the box. 120 pods / $12 = 10 pods per dollar.

Now we know you get 10 pods per dollar. To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the number of pods per dollar by 1, because you use 1 pod per cycle. 

10 pods per dollar / 1 pod per cycle = 10 cycles per dollar.

"Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, so he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, so he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills. He is left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

Thomas then triples his money, so he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now worth 5 dollars, he has 60 * 5 = 300 dollars in 5 dollar bills.

The final answer is: 300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 x 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 x 8 = 2 goals.

So, in the first half, team A scores 4 goals and team B scores 2 goals. In the second half, team A scores 2 goals and team B scores 8 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 + 2 = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16."
"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to find out how much chalk is left after Monday. 

The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. To find 45% of 5, we multiply 5 by 0.45. 

5 x 0.45 = 2.25 inches

So, the teacher used 2.25 inches of chalk on Monday. To find out how much chalk is left, we subtract 2.25 from 5.

5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches

Now, the teacher will use 20% of the chalk each day. We need to find out how many days the 2.75 inches of chalk will last. To do this, we will divide 2.75 by 0.20.

2.75 / 0.20 = 13.75

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round down to 13 days."
"To find out how many students are not on varsity, we need to first find out how many students are on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity. Since there are 12 girls, one-third of 12 is 12 / 3 = 4. So, 4 girls are on varsity.

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity. Since there are 12 boys, one-fourth of 12 is 12 / 4 = 3. So, 3 boys are on varsity.

Now, we add the number of girls and boys on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity. 4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students on varsity.

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students. There are 12 boys and 12 girls, so the total number of students is 12 + 12 = 24. 

24 - 7 = 17 students are not on varsity.

"To find out how much Mr. Marcellus got in refunds, we need to first find out how many gallons of milk were expired. 

2/5 of 4000 gallons is the amount of milk that expired. To find this, we multiply 4000 by 2 and then divide by 5.

4000 * 2 = 8000
8000 / 5 = 1600

So, 1600 gallons of milk were expired. 

Since Mr. Marcellus bought the milk at $3.5 per gallon, we multiply the number of expired gallons by the cost per gallon to find the total refund.

1600 * 3.5 = 5600

Mr. Marcellus got $5600 in refunds."
"Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Colin's current age is C and Wendy's current age is W.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This means that Wendy's current age is five times Colin's age plus seven. We can write this as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This means that Colin's age in 25 years will be one-third of Wendy's current age. We can write this as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for C.

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

To simplify, we can multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7)

Expanding the left side, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Now, let's get all the C terms on one side and the constants on the other side:

3C - 5C = 35 - 75

This simplifies to:

-2C = -40

Now, let's divide both sides by -2 to solve for C:

C = 20

So Colin is 20 years old now.

1. Newton started with 2 apples.
2. He threw 1 apple back into the tree, and 5 more fell out. So now he has 2 (initial apples) + 5 (new apples) = 7 apples.
3. He put 6 apples in his pocket, leaving 1 apple. He threw the remaining apple at the tree, and 6 more apples fell out. So now he has 7 (apples he had) + 6 (new apples) = 13 apples.
4. He picked up all the remaining apples, which is 13.

So, Newton brought home 13 apples."
"To find the total cost, we need to know how many bags of coal Ali ordered. Since each bag is 50 kg and he ordered 850 kg, we can divide 850 by 50 to find the number of bags.

"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to find out how many slices of cheese pizza and pepperoni pizza are eaten in total. 

First, let's find out how many slices of cheese pizza are eaten. Kate's 6 friends each eat 6 slices of cheese pizza, so 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices. 

Since Kate also eats, we need to add 6 slices for her. So, 36 slices + 6 slices = 42 slices of cheese pizza eaten.

Next, let's find out how many slices of pepperoni pizza are eaten. Kate's 6 friends each eat 4 slices of pepperoni pizza, so 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices. 

Since Kate also eats, we need to add 4 slices for her. So, 24 slices + 4 slices = 28 slices of pepperoni pizza eaten.

Now, we need to find out how many cheese pizza pies Kate needs to buy. Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we need to divide the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by 12. 42 slices / 12 slices per pie = 3.5 pies. Since we can't buy half a pie, Kate needs to buy 4 cheese pizza pies.

Next, we need to find out how many pepperoni pizza pies Kate needs to buy. Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to divide the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by 8. 28 slices / 8 slices per pie = 3.5 pies. Since we can't buy half a pie, Kate needs to buy 4 pepperoni pizza pies.

So, Kate needs to buy 4 cheese pizza pies and 4 pepperoni pizza pies.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Jay can build 20 snowballs in 1 hour. To find out how many he can build in 15 minutes, we need to divide 20 by 4 (since there are 4 15-minute periods in an hour). 

20 / 4 = 5 snowballs in 15 minutes.

Now, let's find out how many snowballs Jay builds in 15 minutes and how many melt in 15 minutes. 

He builds 5 snowballs in 15 minutes, but 2 melt. So, he has 5 - 2 = 3 snowballs left after 15 minutes.

Now, let's find out how many snowballs he has after 30 minutes. 

In 30 minutes, he builds 10 snowballs (5 in the first 15 minutes and 5 in the next 15 minutes) and 4 melt (2 in each 15-minute period). So, he has 10 - 4 = 6 snowballs after 30 minutes.

Now, let's find out how many snowballs he has after 45 minutes. 

In 45 minutes, he builds 15 snowballs (5 in the first 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, and 5 in the next 15 minutes) and 6 melt (2 in each 15-minute period). So, he has 15 - 6 = 9 snowballs after 45 minutes.

Now, let's find out how many snowballs he has after 60 minutes. 

In 60 minutes, he builds 20 snowballs and 8 melt (2 in each 15-minute period). So, he has 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs after 60 minutes.

Now, let's find out how many snowballs he has after 75 minutes. 

In 75 minutes, he builds 25 snowballs (5 in the first 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, and 5 in the last 15 minutes) and 10 melt (2 in each 15-minute period). So, he has 25 - 10 = 15 snowballs after 75 minutes.

Now, let's find out how many snowballs he has after 90 minutes. 

In 90 minutes, he builds 30 snowballs (5 in the first 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, and 5 in the last 15 minutes) and 12 melt (2 in each 15-minute period). So, he has 30 - 12 = 18 snowballs after 90 minutes.

Now, let's find out how many snowballs he has after 105 minutes. 

In 105 minutes, he builds 35 snowballs (5 in the first 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes) and 14 melt (2 in each 15-minute period). So, he has 35 - 14 = 21 snowballs after 105 minutes.

Now, let's find out how many snowballs he has after 120 minutes. 

In 120 minutes, he builds 40 snowballs (5 in the first 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, and 5 in the last 15 minutes) and 16 melt (2 in each 15-minute period). So, he has 40 - 16 = 24 snowballs after 120 minutes.

Now, let's find out how many snowballs he has after 135 minutes.

So, he has 45 - 18 = 27 snowballs after 135 minutes.

Now, let's find out how many snowballs he has after 150 minutes. 

In 150 minutes, he builds 50 snowballs (5 in the first 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, and 5 in the last 15 minutes) and 20 melt (2 in each 15-minute period). So, he has 50 - 20 = 30 snowballs after 150 minutes.

Now, let's find out how many snowballs he has after 165 minutes. 

In 165 minutes, he builds 55 snowballs (5 in the first 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, and 5 in the last 15 minutes) and 22 melt (2 in each 15-minute period). So, he has 55 - 22 = 33 snowballs after 165 minutes.

Now, let's find out how many snowballs he has after 180 minutes. 

In 180 minutes, he builds 60 snowballs (5 in the first 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the next 15 minutes, 5 in the last 15 minutes) and 24 melt (2 in each 15-minute period). So, he has 60 - 24 = 36 snowballs after 180 minutes.

Since Jay has 36 snowballs after 180 minutes, he still needs 24 more snowballs to reach 60. 

In the next 15 minutes, he builds 5 snowballs and 2 melt. So, he has 5 - 2 = 3 snowballs after 195 minutes.

In the next 15 minutes, he builds 5 snowballs and 2 melt. So, he has 3 + 5 - 2 = 6 snowballs after 210 minutes.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

If John is 28 now and he was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we need to find out how old Jim was 20 years ago. 

To do that, we need to find out how old John was 20 years ago. We can do that by subtracting 20 from John's current age. 

John's current age is 28. 
John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8 

Now, we know that 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim. So, we can set up an equation: 
John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago 
8 = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago 

To find Jim's age 20 years ago, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2. 
Jim's age 20 years ago = 8 / 2 
Jim's age 20 years ago = 4 

Now, we need to find Jim's current age. We can do that by adding 20 to Jim's age 20 years ago. 
Jim's current age = Jim's age 20 years ago + 20 
Jim's current age = 4 + 20 
Jim's current age = 24

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Doxa ate 1 slice. 
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. 
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices they all ate: 
Doxa ate 1 slice, her sister ate 2 slices, and her brother ate 3 slices. 
1 + 2 + 3 = 6 slices.

"Let's break down the information given:

- On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 1 pack of 50 bandages.
- On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
- On the third day, they ordered 2 packs of 50 bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages.
- They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x. 

After the first day, they had x - 38 + 50 bandages (since they ordered 1 pack of 50).
After the second day, they had (x - 38 + 50) - 28 bandages.
After the third day, they had ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) + 100 (2 packs of 50) - 25 bandages.

We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages. So, we can set up the equation:

((x - 38 + 50) - 28) + 100 - 25 = 78

Simplifying the equation:
(x - 38 + 50 - 28) + 100 - 25 = 78
(x + 4) + 75 = 78
x + 79 = 78

Now, let's solve for x:
x = 78 - 79
x = -1

However, the number of bandages cannot be negative. This means that the initial number of bandages must be more than the total number of bandages used and ordered. Let's re-examine the problem.

Let's try to find the total number of bandages used and ordered. On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 50. On the second day, they used 28 bandages. On the third day, they used 25 bandages and ordered 100. 

The total number of bandages used and ordered is 38 + 28 + 25 + 50 + 100 = 241. 

Since they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, the initial number of bandages must be the total number of bandages used and ordered plus the number of bandages left. 

Initial number of bandages = 241 + 78 = 319

The final answer is: 319"
"To find the cost of the haircut, we need to find out how many inches May's hair was cut. We know her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches. 

10 (initial inches) - 8 (final inches) = 2 inches

So, her hair was cut 2 inches. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost of the haircut is:

2 inches * $30 per inch = $60

The cost of the color is $40. To find the total cost, we add the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color:

$60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100

"To find out how much Jen will receive, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total pay. 

First, let's find out how many hours Jen works in a week. 
Jen works 7.5 hours a day and 6 days a week. 
7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week

Since there are 4 weeks in April, we need to multiply the hours she works in a week by the number of weeks in April. 
45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Now, let's calculate Jen's total pay. 
Her hourly rate is $1.5. 
180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Jen also receives an additional $10 for complete attendance. 
So, we add $10 to her total pay. 
$270 + $10 = $280

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant. 
3. After that, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is 2 x 40 = 80 people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times that number is 3 x 50 = 150 people.

Now, let's add up the total number of people who entered the restaurant:

50 (morning) + 40 (at 10:00) + 80 (after 10:00) + 150 (by evening) = 320

"Let's break this down step by step.

John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600. To find the cost of one bottle of scotch, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles:

$600 ÷ 10 = $60 per bottle of scotch.

He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 10 x 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.

Cognac costs 50% more than scotch, so the cost of one bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 x 0.5) = $60 + $30 = $90.

Now, we multiply the number of bottles of cognac by the cost per bottle to find the total cost of cognac:

20 x $90 = $1800.

To find the total amount John spent, we add the cost of scotch and cognac:

$600 (scotch) + $1800 (cognac) = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"Let's break it down step by step.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, so he planted 2 x 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total number of White Oak trees is 20 + 10 = 30. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day, so he planted 1/4 of 40, which is 10, more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

Now, let's add up the total number of trees planted on both days. The total number of White Oak trees is 20 + 30 = 50. The total number of Lodgepole Pine trees is 40 + 50 = 90.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 50 + 90 = 140.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is x.

The problem says ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" which means we need to multiply the number of coffee mugs by 4 and then add 8.

So, the equation would be: 4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the +8 on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation.

4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Now, we need to get rid of the 4 that's being multiplied by x. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 4.

4x / 4 = 32 / 4
x = 8

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The efficiency is 80%, so the actual number of jelly beans is 3600 * 0.8 = 2880.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans is 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

However, the true number of red jelly beans is 900. 

To find how far off his guess was, we need to find the difference between his guess and the true number of red jelly beans. 

Since we don't know his guess, we need to find the number of red jelly beans he would have guessed if he used the same method. 

The number of red jelly beans he would have guessed is 3600 * 0.3 * 0.8 = 864.

However, we can find the percentage difference between his guess and the true number of red jelly beans. 

The percentage difference is ((true number - guessed number) / true number) * 100.

The percentage difference is ((900 - 864) / 900) * 100 = 4%.

So, his guess was 4% off."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The bus started with 20 people.
2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus is now 20 + 40 = 60.
3. At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first stop, 3/4 of 40 is 30. So, 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. Now, the total number of people on the bus is 60 + 30 = 90.
4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus is now 90 * 2 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits in two parts: the first 5 years and the next 3 years.

In the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the cost per year is 2 * 3 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 6 * 5 = $30.

In the next 3 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = $5. The cost per year is 5 * 3 = $15. For 3 years, the total cost is 15 * 3 = $45.

The total cost of all visits is 30 + 45 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to find out how many groups of 8 students can be made from 10 students in each grade. 

There are 4 grades (4-7) and each grade has 10 students. So, the total number of students is 4 x 10 = 40 students.

Since 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find out how many groups can be made. 

40 students / 8 students per group = 5 groups

Since each group uses 45 minutes, we need to multiply the number of groups by the time each group uses. 

5 groups x 45 minutes per group = 225 minutes

The answer is 225."
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the tables and the total cost of the roof frames, then add them together.

The cost of the tables is 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.
The cost of the roof frames is 2 frames * $10 per frame = $20.

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames together: $80 + $20 = $100.

So, Ali has to pay John $100."
"Let's say the shorter piece is x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it's divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is 40 feet.

We can write an equation to represent this:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

So, the shorter piece is 8 feet long. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the longer piece is 4x = 4(8) = 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we need to know how many pounds of meat he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide 80 by 16 to find out how many pounds of meat he needs.

80 ÷ 16 = 5

So, Aiden needs 5 pounds of meat. Since he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can multiply 5 by 2 to find out how much seasoning he needs.

5 x 2 = 10

Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning."
"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the number of windows by the width of each window. 

Number of windows: 5
Width of each window: 35 inches

Total width of windows = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width of windows = 5 * 35
Total width of windows = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the total width by 2.

Fabric needed = 2 * Total width of windows
Fabric needed = 2 * 175
Fabric needed = 350 inches

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the cost of the call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the rest of the call.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is 16 * $0.25 = $4.

"To find out how much rain will fall on Tuesday, we need to first find out how much rain fell on Monday, which is 2 inches. 

Then, we need to find out how much rain will fall on Tuesday, which is 1 more inch than twice the amount of Monday's total. 

Twice the amount of Monday's total is 2 x 2 = 4 inches. 

1 more inch than that is 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

So, the total amount of rain on Tuesday will be 5 inches. 

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Let's say the number of cupcakes Carly made is x. Since she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, the number of brownies she made is 3x - 2.

We know that each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. So, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies. So, we can write the equation: x + (3x - 2) = 10.

Now, let's solve the equation. First, we combine like terms: x + 3x - 2 = 10. This simplifies to 4x - 2 = 10.

Next, we add 2 to both sides of the equation: 4x = 10 + 2. This simplifies to 4x = 12.

Finally, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 12 / 4. This simplifies to x = 3.

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To find the total cost, we need to first find the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount, then add the cost of the nail art.

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75.

The discount is 20% of $75, which is 0.2 x $75 = $15.

So, the total cost with the discount is $75 - $15 = $60.

Now, we need to add the cost of the nail art. There are 10 fingers, so the total cost of the nail art is 10 x $3 = $30.

The total cost is $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues from the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year, the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year, and the last magazine.

The 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year will send 3 x 12 = 36 issues.

The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year will send 1 x 6 = 6 issues.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 x 6 = 24 issues.

Now, we add up all the issues: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan gets 66 magazines every year."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Samantha has 27 paintings. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.

Shelley has 39 paintings and she has 8 more paintings than Kim, so Kim has 39 - 8 = 31 paintings.

The answer is 31."
"To find the price of the toy after it was discounted in January, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, we need to find the price of the toy in December after it increased by 80%. 
   To do this, we multiply the original price by 1.8 (100% + 80% = 180%, or 1 + 1.8 = 2.8, or 100% + 80% = 180%, or 1 + 80/100 = 1.8).

   Price in December = $40 * 1.8 = $72

2. Next, we need to find the price of the toy in January after it decreased by 50%. 
   To do this, we multiply the price in December by 0.5 (100% - 50% = 50%, or 1 - 0.5 = 0.5, or 100% - 50% = 50%, or 1 - 50/100 = 0.5).

   Price in January = $72 * 0.5 = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make, we need to calculate the money he makes from the standard lessons and the money he makes from the lessons with the veteran.

First, let's calculate the money he makes from the standard lessons. He has 4 lessons at $80 each, so that's 4 x $80 = $320.

Now, let's calculate the money he makes from the lessons with the veteran. He has 2 lessons, but his rate is reduced by 25%. To find the reduced rate, we need to subtract 25% of $80 from $80. 25% of $80 is 0.25 x $80 = $20. So, his reduced rate is $80 - $20 = $60.

Now, we multiply the reduced rate by the number of lessons with the veteran: 2 x $60 = $120.

Now, we add the money he makes from the standard lessons and the money he makes from the lessons with the veteran: $320 + $120 = $440.

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and then divide by the number of scores.

First, let's add up all the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

Now, we have the total score: 630

Next, we need to count the number of scores: 
There are 9 scores.

To find the mean, we divide the total score by the number of scores:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. 

1/4 of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5. 

So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos. 

Since Eve had 20 pomelos originally and she is left with 5, she must have given away 20 - 5 = 15 pomelos.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many apples Walter ate, we need to multiply 60 by 2/5. 

60 * (2/5) = 60 * 2 / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, we need to find out how many apples were left. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we need to find out how many apples Walter gave to his sister. 25% of 36 is 0.25 * 36 = 9.

So, Walter gave 9 apples to his sister. Now, we need to find out how many apples were left. 

36 - 9 = 27

Now, we need to find out how much money Walter received from selling the remaining apples. 

27 * 3 = 81

If Regina wrote 9 novels last year and that's 3 quarters of the number of novels she wrote this year, we need to find out the total number of novels she wrote this year.

Let's call the total number of novels she wrote this year ""x"".

Since 9 novels is 3 quarters of the total, we can set up an equation:

9 = (3/4) * x

To find x, we need to multiply both sides by 4/3 to get rid of the fraction:

9 * (4/3) = x
x = 12

So, Regina wrote 12 novels this year."
"To find the distance Michael traveled in 3 days, we need to multiply his speed by the number of hours in 3 days. 

There are 24 hours in a day, so 3 days is 3 x 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we multiply his speed by the number of hours: 50 km/hr * 72 hr = 3600 km.

To find the percentage of the distance he covered, we need to divide the distance he traveled by the total distance between Alaska and Texas, and then multiply by 100.

Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100

First, we divide 3600 by 6000: 3600 / 6000 = 0.6

Then, we multiply by 100: 0.6 * 100 = 60

So, Michael covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas."
"Let's break this down step by step.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. 
Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 6 x 5 = 30 grapes.

Now, we have the total grapes used by Madeline and her brother: 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie needs 12 grapes, so she used 4 x 12 = 48 grapes.

Now, we have the total grapes used by everyone: 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

Since we know that 84 grapes were used, we need to add the grapes that were eaten by Madeline to find the total number of grapes at the beginning. So, the total number of grapes at the beginning is 84 + 6 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the number of teachers at school that day, we need to add the number of teachers who were not sick to the number of substitute teachers.

First, let's find the number of teachers who were not sick. We know that 13 teachers were sick out of 82. To find the number of teachers who were not sick, we subtract 13 from 82.

82 - 13 = 69

Now, we add the number of teachers who were not sick to the number of substitute teachers.

69 + 9 = 78

So, there were 78 teachers at school that day."
"To find out how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to first find out how much he spends in one week. 

The pasta costs $1.00 a box. 
The cheddar cheese costs $3.00. 
The gruyere cheese costs twice the amount of the cheddar cheese, so it costs 2 x $3.00 = $6.00.

So, the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one week is $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the weekly cost by 52 to find the yearly cost. 
$10.00 x 52 = $520.00

The final answer is: $520.00"
"To find out how many classrooms the custodian can clean in a day, we need to multiply the number of hours they work in a day by the number of classrooms they can clean in an hour. 

First, let's find out how many classrooms they can clean in an hour. Since it takes them 15 minutes per classroom, we need to convert the time to hours. 15 minutes is 15/60 = 0.25 hours. 

Now, we can divide 1 hour by 0.25 hours to find out how many classrooms they can clean in an hour. 1 / 0.25 = 4 classrooms per hour.

Now, we multiply the number of classrooms they can clean in an hour by the number of hours they work in a day. 4 classrooms/hour * 8 hours/day = 32 classrooms/day.

Now, we need to find out how many classrooms they need to clean in total. There are 80 classrooms. 

Now, we divide the total number of classrooms by the number of classrooms they can clean in a day. 80 classrooms / 32 classrooms/day = 2.5 days.

Since they have 5 days to clean the school, we need to find out how many hours they work in 5 days. 5 days * 8 hours/day = 40 hours.

Now, we need to find out how many hours they spend cleaning classrooms in 5 days. 2.5 days * 8 hours/day = 20 hours.

Now, we need to find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning classrooms. We divide the number of hours spent cleaning classrooms by the total number of hours worked in 5 days. 20 hours / 40 hours = 0.5.

Now, we need to convert 0.5 to a percentage. 0.5 * 100 = 50%.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books that one bookcase can hold: 
2 middle shelves can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books
Adding the bottom and top shelves, the total number of books one bookcase can hold is 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases she needs to hold all of them. To do this, we'll divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold:
110 / 55 = 2

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books."
"To find the total cost of the eggs, we need to multiply the number of dozens by the cost per dozen. 

5 dozens * $2.40 per dozen = 5 * 2.40 = $12

To find the total number of eggs, we multiply the number of dozens by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs). 

5 dozens * 12 eggs per dozen = 5 * 12 = 60 eggs

Rose will sell the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs. To find the cost per egg, we divide $1 by 3.

$1 / 3 = $0.33 per egg

Now, we multiply the total number of eggs by the selling price per egg to find the total revenue.

60 eggs * $0.33 per egg = 60 * 0.33 = $20

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

"To find out how many white hats Skyler has, we need to first find out how many hats are red and blue. 

Half of the hats are red, so that's 100 / 2 = 50 red hats.

Now, we need to find out how many hats are remaining. We already know that 50 hats are red, so we subtract that from the total number of hats: 100 - 50 = 50 hats remaining.

3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so we multiply 50 by 3/5: 50 * 3/5 = 30 blue hats.

Now, we know that 50 hats are red and 30 hats are blue. To find out how many hats are white, we subtract the number of red and blue hats from the total number of hats: 100 - 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

So, the total cost of the bag after the discount is $15.00.

Now, we need to find out how much each stick of jerky costs. There are 30 sticks in a bag, and the total cost of the bag is $15.00.

To find the cost of each stick, we need to divide the total cost by the number of sticks.

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50

Since we need the answer in cents, we need to convert the dollar amount to cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar.

$0.50 x 100 = 50 cents

The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so it's 5x - 4.

The total number of ice cubes is 116, which is the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes. So, we can write the equation: x + (5x - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6x - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6x = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 20.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's find the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 is 4, so 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each.

The number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.
The number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

"To find the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we need to find the time it takes for him to cover the land part and the water part separately, then add them together.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, Phineas needs to cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

Time taken to cover 100 yards on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Time taken to cover 100 yards in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Total time taken = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

There are 4 additional phones, so the cost of the additional phones is 4 x $10 = $40. 

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is $20 + $40 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to know how many days are in June. June has 30 days. 

Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since 1 dozen is 12, Derrick makes 10 x 12 = 120 doughnuts every day.

He sells each doughnut for $2. So, he makes 120 x $2 = $240 every day.

To find out how much he makes in June, we multiply the amount he makes every day by the number of days in June: $240 x 30 = $7200.

The final answer is: $7200"

"To find out how long it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to find out how many words he can speak in a minute after training, and then multiply that by the total number of words in 10 pages.

First, let's find out how many words John can speak in a minute after training. His normal speed is 150 WPM, and he is 2.5 times faster after training. 

150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, let's find out how many words are in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so:

10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

"Let's break down the information given:

Day 1: 50 people
Day 2: 20 more people than Day 1, so 50 + 20 = 70 people
Day 3: Twice the number of people as Day 2, so 2 x 70 = 140 people

Now, we know the number of people for the first 3 days. We need to find the total number of people for the rest of the week, which is 4 more days. 

Since Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week, the total number of people for the rest of the week is 60 x 4 = 240 people.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the amount of the first 30 seconds pop, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels pop.

In the next 30 seconds, four times the amount of the previous 30 seconds pop, so 4 * 60 = 240 kernels pop.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 240 / 2 = 120 kernels pop.

So, in total, 20 + 60 + 240 + 120 = 440 kernels pop.

After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat. A quarter of 120 is 120 / 4 = 30 kernels.

So, the total number of kernels that pop is 440 + 30 = 470.

The final answer is: 470"
"To find out how many lemons Tim will need, we need to calculate the total amount of lemonade he will make and the extra lemonade for Allen.

First, we know that Tim will make 4 gallons of lemonade. Since each gallon needs 1 cup of lemon juice, he will need 4 cups of lemon juice for the regular lemonade.

For the extra lemonade, he will make 1 gallon, but it will be twice as tart as the other gallons. This means it will need 2 cups of lemon juice.

So, in total, Tim will need 4 cups (for the regular lemonade) + 2 cups (for the extra lemonade) = 6 cups of lemon juice.

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, Tim will need 6 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 36 lemons.

"To find out how far Elvis is from his house, we need to find out how far he traveled in total. 

First, we need to find out how far he traveled west. We can do this by multiplying the speed (18mph) by the time (5 hours). 

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 18 x 5
Distance = 90 miles

Then, we need to find out how far he traveled east. We can do this by multiplying the speed (18mph) by the time (8 hours).

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 18 x 8
Distance = 144 miles

Now, we need to find the total distance he traveled. We can do this by adding the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east.

Total Distance = Distance West + Distance East
Total Distance = 90 + 144
Total Distance = 234 miles

Since Elvis turned around and traveled back, we need to find the distance between his current location and his house. We can do this by subtracting the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east.

Distance from House = Distance East - Distance West
Distance from House = 144 - 90
Distance from House = 54 miles

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

First year depreciation: 
Value after first year = Initial value - (Initial value * depreciation rate)
Value after first year = $9000 - ($9000 * 0.30)
Value after first year = $9000 - $2700
Value after first year = $6300

Second year depreciation: 
Value after second year = Value after first year - (Value after first year * depreciation rate)
Value after second year = $6300 - ($6300 * 0.30)
Value after second year = $6300 - $1890
Value after second year = $4410

Third year depreciation: 
Value after third year = Value after second year - (Value after second year * depreciation rate)
Value after third year = $4410 - ($4410 * 0.20)
Value after third year = $4410 - $882
Value after third year = $3528

Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to find 1% of 1600.

1% of 1600 = (1/100) * 1600
1% of 1600 = 0.01 * 1600
1% of 1600 = 16

So, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."

A penny is worth 1 cent, or $0.01. 
750 pennies = 750 x $0.01 = $7.50

Now, let's add the values of all the coins together:
$8 + $9.50 = $17.50
$17.50 + $6 = $23.50
$23.50 + $7.50 = $31

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"To find out how much money Janet has left, we need to add up all the money she spent and subtract that from the money her parents gave her.

First, let's add up the money she spent:
- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets: 2 tickets * $7.50 = $15
- Bracelet: $8.50
Total money spent: $3.50 + $15 + $8.50 = $27

Now, let's subtract the money she spent from the money her parents gave her:
$40 - $27 = $13

So, Janet has $13 left."
"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to find out how many days he works in 2 weeks and then multiply that by the number of cars he services per day and his pay per car.

Josh is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday, so he works 5 days a week. In 2 weeks, he works 5 days a week * 2 weeks = 10 days.

He services 3 cars a day, so in 10 days, he services 3 cars/day * 10 days = 30 cars.

He gets paid $4 per car, so he makes 30 cars * $4/car = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's break it down step by step:

Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. 

He ate 1 oatmeal cookie, 1 chocolate chip cookie, and 1 sugar cookie for an early day snack. So, he has:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

Then, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So, he has:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
- 4 sugar cookies (no change)

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So, he has:
- 6 oatmeal cookies (no change)
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

Then, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. So, he now has:
- 6 + 4 = 10 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

Now, let's add up all the cookies he has:
10 (oatmeal) + 7 (chocolate chip) + 6 (sugar) = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much Matthew would earn, we need to know how many toy soldiers he will sell for $5 and how many for $7. Since he has 12 unique toy soldiers, we can divide them into two equal halves. 

12 / 2 = 6

So, Matthew will sell 6 toy soldiers for $5 each and 6 toy soldiers for $7 each.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he will earn from selling the toy soldiers for $5 each:
6 * 5 = 30

And the total amount of money he will earn from selling the toy soldiers for $7 each:
6 * 7 = 42

Now, let's add the two amounts together to find the total amount of money Matthew will earn:
30 + 42 = 72

The final answer is: $72"
"Let's break this down step by step.

First, Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days. So, the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Now, Nate starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled in a day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes.

To find out how many days it takes to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled in a day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the number of weeks by dividing the total number of days by 7: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the average enrollment at Butler High School, we need to multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4.

Average enrollment at Norman High School = 4000 students
Average enrollment at Butler High School = 3/4 * 4000
= 3 * 1000
= 3000 students

Now, we need to find the difference between the average enrollment at Norman High School and Butler High School.

Difference = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies they made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

First, let's add the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies:
2595 + 3075 = 5670

Now, let's subtract the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies:
7995 - 5670 = 2325

So, the Adams family made 2325 chocolate chip cookies. 

2325"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
- He gathered two more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
- He had the correct number of beakers, which is 7.
- The total number of items on the lab bench is 29.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

8 (test tubes) + 7 (beakers) + 16 (Petri dishes) - x (beakers lost) = 29

Combine the constants:
8 + 7 + 16 - x = 29
31 - x = 29

Now, solve for x:
x = 31 - 29
x = 2

So, Igor lost 2 beakers."
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to first find out how many screws he will use. 

Each table has 4 legs and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws. 

Since James is putting together 4 tables, he will need 4 x 8 = 32 screws. 

He has 40 screws, and he will use 32 screws, so he will have 40 - 32 = 8 screws left over.

The final answer is: 8"
"If there are 10 eggs in a basket, and there are twice as many eggs in a second basket, that means the second basket has 2 x 10 = 20 eggs.

So, we have 10 eggs in the first basket and 20 eggs in the second basket. 

To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430. So, Kim raises 430 + 320 = 750 dollars.

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. So, Maryam raises 300 + 400 = 700 dollars.

Now, we need to add up the money raised by all of them. 

Kim raised 750 dollars, Alexandra raised 430 dollars, Maryam raised 700 dollars, and Sarah raised 300 dollars. 

So, the total money raised is 750 + 430 + 700 + 300 = 2180 dollars.

The final answer is: 2180"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Since Aaron was able to run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, if Aaron ran 1 mile in x minutes, Vanessa would run 1 mile in 2x minutes. 

Since Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes and he ran half the distance of Vanessa, he must have run 2 miles. 

If Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, then he ran 1 mile in 8 minutes. 

Since Aaron ran 1 mile in 8 minutes, Vanessa would run 1 mile in 2 * 8 = 16 minutes. 

Vanessa ran 4 miles, so she would take 4 * 16 = 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find out how much line the caretaker needs, we need to know how much line is needed for 200 feet of dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply 200 feet by 3.

200 feet * 3 feet/foot = 600 feet

The caretaker already has 6 feet of line, so we need to subtract that from the total amount of line needed.

600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line."
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate how much they make in one night and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

They get 6 reservations a night. Each reservation orders 2 meals that cost $5 each, so that's 2 x $5 = $10 per meal. They also order a $5 bottle of wine. So, the total cost per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since they get 6 reservations a night, they make 6 x $15 = $90 per night.

They are open 2 days a week, so they make $90 x 2 = $180 per week.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to first find out the total cost price of all the watermelons. The cost price is $80. 

Since the vendor sold all the watermelons at a profit of 25%, the selling price is 125% of the cost price (100% of the cost price + 25% profit). 

To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 1.25 (which is 100% + 25%). 

Selling price = Cost price * 1.25
Selling price = $80 * 1.25
Selling price = $100

Now, we know the total selling price is $100 and there are 50 watermelons. To find the price of each watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons.

Price of each watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
Price of each watermelon = $100 / 50
Price of each watermelon = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break this down step by step.

1. James is now twice as old as Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means James is 2 * 12 = 24 years old now.

2. Since James is 24 years old now, and he was born when John was 19, we can find out how old John is now by adding 24 to 19. John is 43 years old now.

3. John's youngest son was born when John was 32. This means John's youngest son is 43 - 32 = 11 years old now.

4. In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 11 + 3 = 14 years old.

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, and Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes. To find out how many oranges they can peel in an hour (60 minutes), we need to divide 60 by the time it takes each of them to peel an orange.

For Ana: 60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges
For Jane: 60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges

Now, we need to find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane. To do this, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peeled from the number of oranges Ana peeled.

20 (Ana's oranges) - 15 (Jane's oranges) = 5

So, Ana will have 5 more oranges peeled than Jane after an hour.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how much Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor cost.

First, let's find the cost of the radiator. The original price is $400, but Mark gets it for 80% off. To find 80% of $400, we multiply 400 by 0.8 (which is the same as 80%).

400 x 0.8 = 320

So, Mark pays $320 for the radiator.

Next, let's find the labor cost. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour. To find the total labor cost, we multiply the number of hours by the hourly rate.

3 x 50 = 150

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid.

320 + 150 = 470

So, Mark paid $470."
"Let's say the number of chickens is C and the number of cows is 20 - C (since there are 20 animals in total).

Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. We know that the total number of legs is 70. 

We can write an equation to represent this: 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70

Simplifying the equation: 
2C + 80 - 4C = 70
-2C + 80 = 70
-2C = -10
C = 5

So, there are 5 chickens."
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we need to find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. 

Total number of slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. There are 4 people in total, including Henry and his 3 friends.

Number of slices per person = Total number of slices / Number of people
= 56 slices / 4 people
= 14 slices per person

So, each person can have 14 slices."
