"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4, so she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

Now, let's subtract the number of eggs she uses from the total number of eggs she lays: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. To find out how much she makes, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg: 9 * 2 = 18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. 

Since it takes half the amount of white fiber as blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we need 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the blue and white fiber bolts together: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we need to first find the total value of the house after repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

Let's denote the total value of the house after repairs as x. We can set up the equation:

x = 80,000 + 50,000
x = 130,000

However, the value of the house increased by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original value and add it to the original value.

150% of 80,000 is 1.5 * 80,000 = 120,000

Now, we add this to the original value:

x = 80,000 + 120,000
x = 200,000

So, the total value of the house after repairs is $200,000.

To find the profit, we subtract the original cost of the house from the total value after repairs:

Profit = Total value after repairs - Original cost
Profit = 200,000 - 80,000
Profit = 120,000

The final answer is: $120,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total number of meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sprint sessions he does in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James does this 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to find out the total number of cups of feed she gives to her chickens in a day. 

In the morning, she gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens 25 cups of feed. So, the total number of cups of feed she gives in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in a day is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Since she has already given her chickens 40 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon, she needs to give them 60 - 40 = 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
We can see that the cost of each glass decreases by 40% (1 - 0.6 = 0.4) each time. 

The cost of the first glass is $5, the second is $3, the third is $1.8, the fourth is $1.08, the fifth is $0.648, the sixth is $0.3888, the seventh is $0.23328, the eighth is $0.139808, the ninth is $0.0838848, the tenth is $0.05033088, the eleventh is $0.030198528, the twelfth is $0.0181191184, the thirteenth is $0.01087167104, the fourteenth is $0.006523002624, the fifteenth is $0.0038760015376, the sixteenth is $0.00233580089664.

Now, we add up the costs of all 16 glasses: 
$5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.648 + $0.3888 + $0.23328 + $0.139808 + $0.0838848 + $0.05033088 + $0.030198528 + $0.0181191184 + $0.01087167104 + $0.006523002624 + $0.0038760015376 + $0.00233580089664 = $23.823.

The final answer is: $23.823"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   Since Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

2. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   Since Charleston has 80 sheep, Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add up the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
160 (Toulouse) + 80 (Charleston) + 20 (Seattle) = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to calculate the time taken for the first part of the download and the time taken for the second part of the download.

First, let's find the time taken for the first part of the download. Carla can download 2 GB/minute. The file is 200 GB, and she downloads 40% of it in the first part. 

40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB

Time taken to download 80 GB = 80 / 2 = 40 minutes

After the restart, Carla has to download the remaining 60% of the file (100% - 40% = 60%). 

60% of 200 GB = 0.6 * 200 = 120 GB

Time taken to download 120 GB = 120 / 2 = 60 minutes

Total time taken = Time taken for the first part + Time taken for the second part + Time taken for the restart
Total time taken = 40 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the distance covered in each part.

1. Distance covered in the first 3 hours at 60 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

2. Since John turns around, he is now 180 miles away from home.

3. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance.

4. He then drives at 30 mph for half an hour (0.5 hours):
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

5. Now, he is 180 - 15 = 165 miles away from home.

6. He drives the remaining time (4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 1.5
Distance = 120 miles

7. Now, he is 165 - 120 = 45 miles away from home.

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$"
"To find Eliza's earnings for this week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately, then add them together.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime pay rate is:
$10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

Her earnings for the overtime hours are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Now, we add her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

Her earnings for this week are $460."
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month, so we need to calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 
30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the break-even point, which is the point at which the total cost of planting and maintaining the tree equals the total revenue from selling the lemons.

Let's denote the number of years as 'n'. The total cost of planting the tree is $90. The total cost of maintaining the tree for 'n' years is $3n. The total revenue from selling the lemons for 'n' years is 7n * $1.5 = $10.5n.

The break-even point is when the total cost equals the total revenue:

90 + 3n = 10.5n

Subtract 3n from both sides:

90 = 7.5n

Divide both sides by 7.5:

n = 12

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with ""x"". So, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, the total number of vacuum cleaners she has left after the green house is x - x/3 = 2x/3.

3. After selling 2 more at the red house, she has (2x/3) - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

4. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of (2x/3) - 2 is ((2x/3) - 2)/2 = (x/3) - 1.

5. After selling at the orange house, she has ((2x/3) - 2) - ((x/3) - 1) = (x/3) - 1 vacuum cleaners left.

6. We are given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, (x/3) - 1 = 5.

7. To solve for x, we add 1 to both sides of the equation: x/3 = 6.

8. Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for x: x = 18.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students

The remaining students after contemporary dance is 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

The remaining students after jazz dance is 16 - 4 = 12 students.

The percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is the remaining students divided by the total number of students, multiplied by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To maximize profit, we need to calculate the future value of both options. 

Let's assume the merchant buys the jewelry and sells it at the end of the month. The future value of the jewelry can be calculated using the formula:

FV = PV x (1 + r)

where FV is the future value, PV is the present value, and r is the interest rate (or in this case, the percentage increase in the market).

For the jewelry, the future value would be:
FV_jewelry = $5,000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 x 1.025 = $5,125

Now, let's calculate the future value of the electronic gadgets:
FV_gadgets = $8,000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 x 1.012 = $8,096

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, we need to subtract the initial cost from the future value of each option. 

Profit_jewelry = FV_jewelry - $5,000 = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
Profit_gadgets = FV_gadgets - $8,000 = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits, the merchant would make a higher profit by buying the electronic gadgets, which is $96."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. 

On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance.

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles.

"To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

In 4 weeks, she will eat 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12.

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total time Marissa has taken so far and the total distance she has covered so far. 

She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another hour to walk the next 2 miles. So, the total time taken so far is 1 + 1 = 2 hours. 

The total distance covered so far is 4 + 2 = 6 miles.

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, the total time she should take is 12 / 4 = 3 hours.

Since she has already taken 2 hours, she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to cover the remaining distance.

The remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles. 

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time: 6 / 1 = 6 miles per hour.

"To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. 

Two-thirds of 10 liters = (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters (approximately)

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the remaining one-third is not water. So, the amount of non-water in the orange drink is 10 - 6.67 = 3.33 liters.

Now, let's find the amount of water in the pineapple drink. We need to calculate three-fifths of 15 liters.

Three-fifths of 15 liters = (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters

The total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before spilling is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the amount of water left is 15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters.

However, we are asked to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters. Since we have 15 liters of pineapple drink and 9 liters of water in it, we need to find the amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of the mixture (24 - 15 = 9). 

The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of the mixture is 14.67 - 9 = 5.67 liters.

The final answer is: 5.67"

"To find the original price of the book, we need to set up an equation. Let's call the original price ""x"".

Since there's a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of x, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so we can set up the equation:

x - 0.25x = 19.50

Combine like terms:

0.75x = 19.50

Now, divide both sides by 0.75 to solve for x:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

"To find the total cost of the items Marie ordered excluding the pizza, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken meal, the milk, and the apples.

Cost of chicken meal: $12
Cost of 5 packs of milk: 5 * $3 = $15
Cost of 4 apples: 4 * $1.50 = $6
Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes can be found by subtracting the total cost of the other items from the total amount paid.

Cost of pizza boxes: $50 - $33 = $17

Now, we need to find the number of boxes of pizza. Each box costs $8.50, so we can divide the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of one box to find the number of boxes.

Number of boxes of pizza: $17 / $8.50 = 2

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 cartons of ice cream for 60 days (1 carton per day).

Each carton has 15 servings, so to find the total number of cartons she needs, we divide the total number of days by the number of servings per carton:
60 days / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the total number of cartons by the cost per carton:
4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance traveled between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 from 60. 

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance of the first stop and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

20 miles (first stop) + 45 miles (distance from second stop to the end) = 65 miles, but this is the total distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. To find the distance between the two stops, we need to subtract the distance of the first stop from the total distance from the first stop to the end of the trip.

65 - 20 = 45 miles

However, this is the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. To find the distance between the two stops, we need to subtract the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip from the distance of the first stop. 

45 miles (distance from first stop to end) - 45 miles (distance from second stop to end) = 0 miles is incorrect. We need to find the distance from the first stop to the second stop.

"Let's denote the cost of the boots as B and the cost of the more expensive pair of heels as H. We know that the other pair of heels costs $33. We also know that the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. 

Since the other pair of heels costs $33, the more expensive pair of heels costs 2 * 33 = 66 dollars.

We can set up the equation: 33 + 66 = B - 5

Combine like terms: 99 = B - 5

Add 5 to both sides: 104 = B

The boots cost $104. 

The final answer is: $104"
"Let's denote Darrell's age as 7x and Allen's age as 11x, where x is a constant. 

Since their total age is 162, we can write the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age: 
Allen's age = 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to find the total number of guesses and divide by the number of people.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first one: 80 / 2 = 40, then 40 + 20 = 60.
The third person guesses 25% more than the first one: 80 * 0.25 = 20, then 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, we add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 people, so we divide the total by 3 to find the average: 240 / 3 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog. 

Number of dogs: 10
Time spent on each dog: 0.5 hours

Total time spent in a day = 10 * 0.5 = 5 hours

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the daily time by 7 to find the total time spent in a week.

Total time spent in a week = 5 hours/day * 7 days = 35 hours

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We are given that G = S + 30.

We also know that the total number of coins is 110, so S + G = 110.

Substituting G = S + 30 into the second equation, we get S + (S + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2S = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30: G = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"

2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. 
   Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20
   Aaron has 5 more jewels than 20, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.
3. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.
   Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. 
25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in both periods: 
4 points (first 20 minutes) + 5 points (second 20 minutes) = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first find out how much he spends per day and then multiply it by 30.

Since Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, and they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out the cost of 2 yogurts. 

To find the cost of 2 yogurts, we can divide the total cost of 4 yogurts ($5.00) by 2. 

Cost of 2 yogurts = $5.00 / 2 = $2.50

Now, we multiply the cost of 2 yogurts by the number of days (30) to find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days.

Total cost = $2.50 * 30 = $75.00

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many Lego sets John has left, we first need to calculate how much money he made from selling the Lego sets and then subtract the cost of the video games and the remaining money.

John sells 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is:
13 * 15 = 195 dollars

He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is:
8 * 20 = 160 dollars

He also has $5 left after buying the video games, so the total amount of money he spent is:
160 + 5 = 165 dollars

Now, we subtract the total amount of money he spent from the total amount of money he made to find out how much money he has left:
195 - 165 = 30 dollars

However, the question asks for the number of Lego sets he still has, not the amount of money he has left. Since he sold all his Lego sets initially, the number of Lego sets he has left is 0."
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to first calculate the total hours he runs per week. 

He runs 3 hours the first day, and half as much on the other two days, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours per day. 

So, the total hours he runs per week is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

Since he runs 60 miles in a week, we can find his speed by dividing the total miles by the total hours: 

Speed = Total miles / Total hours = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
- Her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, so her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.
- Her running speed is four times her walking speed, so her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she spends 6 hours in total, she spends 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours running and 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.

Distance = Speed * Time. 

Distance running = 6 * 2 = 12 miles
Distance walking = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles

Total distance = 12 + 6 = 18 miles

"To find the distance Polly can stand outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon, we need to find the total distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone, and then subtract the dragon's reach from that distance.

When Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find the distance outside the dragon's reach, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw with the gemstone: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces. 

First, let's find the total number of pieces. Since Grandma Jones cut each pie into 8 pieces and she baked 5 pies, the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40.

Now, let's subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces to find out how many pieces were taken by the guests. 
40 - 14 = 26

"To find out how many calories you can still consume, subtract the calories you've already consumed from your daily target: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, multiply the number of servings you can still consume by the total weight of the bag: 0.8 * 300 = 240 grams.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total cost. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, and Charlie makes 10 candles from one pound of beeswax, the cost per candle is $1.00 ($10.00 / 10 candles). 

The total cost for 20 candles is $20.00 ($1.00 per candle * 20 candles).

Now, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so the total revenue for 20 candles is $40.00 ($2.00 per candle * 20 candles).

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. 

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is (2/5) * 5 = 2. 
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. 
Twice 7 is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since it takes 4 hours to write one article, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Candice started with 80 post-it notes.
2. She placed a single post-it note on each of 220 cups of coffee, so she used 220 post-it notes.
3. After using 220 post-it notes, she had 80 - 220 = -140 post-it notes left.
4. However, we know that she had 23 post-it notes remaining overall, so the -140 must be the result of subtracting the post-it notes she purchased from the 80 she started with.
5. Let x be the number of post-it notes in the package she purchased. Then, 80 - x = -140.
6. To solve for x, we add x to both sides of the equation: 80 = -140 + x.
7. Then, we add 140 to both sides of the equation: 80 + 140 = x.
8. Simplifying the equation, we get 220 = x.

The final answer is: 220"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find the number of blue ties, we can divide the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie:
   Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
   Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
   Number of blue ties = 5

2. Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:
   Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
   Number of red ties = 2 * 5
   Number of red ties = 10

3. The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. This means the cost of each red tie is 1.5 times the cost of each blue tie:
   Cost of each red tie = 1.5 * Cost of each blue tie
   Cost of each red tie = 1.5 * $40
   Cost of each red tie = $60

4. To find the total amount spent on red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie:
   Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
   Total amount spent on red ties = 10 * $60
   Total amount spent on red ties = $600

5. To find the total amount spent on ties, we add the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:
   Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
   Total amount spent on ties = $200 + $600
   Total amount spent on ties = $800

The final answer is: $800"

First, let's find out how many eggs are produced per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 252 * 7 = 1764 eggs per week

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total amount Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs * $2 per dozen = 147 * 2 = $294

"To find the total time Tom's ship takes to travel from 1 to 4 PM and back, we need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the journey separately.

First, let's find the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. Since the time is given in a 12-hour format, we assume it's 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM, which is 3 hours. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find the time taken to travel back. The distance remains the same, 30 miles, but the speed is 6 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, the time taken to get back is 5 hours."
"To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the total weight of the comic books he removed. 

Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removed 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, the remaining weight that needs to be removed from toys is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys he needs to remove is 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

"To find the revenue earned on Thursday, we need to calculate the total revenue from truck tires and car tires separately and then add them together. 

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday: 6 truck tires * $60 per tire = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday: 4 car tires * $40 per tire = $160
Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Revenue from car tires on Friday: 12 car tires * $40 per tire = $480
Since no truck tires were repaired on Friday, the revenue from truck tires is $0.

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the revenues: $520 (Thursday) and $480 (Friday). Thursday has higher revenue.

Now, we need to find the difference in revenue between the two days: 
$520 (Thursday) - $480 (Friday) = $40

"To find the number of good oranges, we first need to find the total number of unripe and bad oranges. 

There are 1 bad oranges and 2 sour oranges, so the total number of unripe and bad oranges is 1 + 2 = 3.

We are given that 20% of the oranges are unripe. Let's convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 20/100 = 0.2.

Now, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 0.2 * 25 = 5.

The total number of unripe and bad oranges is 3, and the number of unripe oranges is 5. Since 1 is bad, the number of unripe oranges is 5 - 1 = 4. 

However, we already know that 20% of the oranges are unripe, which is 5. So, the number of unripe oranges is indeed 5. This means that the 1 bad orange is also included in the 20% unripe oranges. 

So, the total number of unripe and bad oranges is 5. 

Now, let's find the number of good oranges: 25 - 5 = 20.

The number of good oranges is 20."

Insurance cost: 10% of $1300 = 0.1 * $1300 = $130
Total amount paid: $1300 + $130 = $1430

The final answer is: $1430"
"To find the annual pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the total value of the pension after 20 years and then add the additional 5% per year for the remaining 10 years.

The total value of the pension after 20 years is $50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000.

The annual increase in pension after 20 years is 5% of the total value, which is 0.05 * $1,000,000 = $50,000.

The annual pension after 20 years is $50,000/year. 

For the remaining 10 years, the annual increase is 5% of the total value, which is 0.05 * $1,000,000 = $50,000. 

The total increase in pension for the remaining 10 years is $50,000/year * 10 years = $500,000.

The annual pension after 30 years is $50,000/year + $500,000 = $550,000/year.

"To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately and then add them together.

The first half of the year is 6 months, so the amount she paid for the first half is:
$140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, she paid 10% less than the initial amount. To find 10% of $140, we multiply $140 by 0.1:
$140 * 0.1 = $14
Then, we subtract this amount from the initial amount to find the reduced amount:
$140 - $14 = $126
The amount she paid for the second half of the year is:
$126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the amounts she paid for the first and second half of the year to find the total amount:
$840 + $756 = $1596

The final answer is: $1596"
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to determine the car's miles per gallon (mpg) rating. 

We know that Sophia traveled 100 miles since the last fill-up and used 4 gallons of gas. To find the mpg rating, we divide the distance traveled by the amount of gas used: 

100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the car's mpg rating, we can find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the mpg rating by the tank capacity:

25 miles/gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles

"To find the total time spent on TV and reading, we need to calculate the time spent each day and then multiply it by the number of days in 4 weeks.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV. 
He then reads for half as long, which is 2 / 2 = 1 hour.

So, the total time spent on TV and reading each day is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent in a week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, the total time spent is 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the total number of students and coaches.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys') with 5 players each, so the total number of students per school is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each school also has 2 coaches, one for each team. 

So, the total number of people per school is 10 (students) + 2 (coaches) = 12.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 4 * 12 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total number of gems, we need to find the number of rubies and emeralds first.

Number of diamonds = 175
Number of rubies = Number of diamonds - 35

"Let's denote the initial amount of money Bailey had as 'x'. 

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total amount she receives is 5 * 8 = $40.

At the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100, which is the sum of the initial amount and the allowance she received. 

We can write this as an equation: x + 40 = 100.

To find the initial amount Bailey had, we need to isolate 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:

x = 100 - 40
x = 60

Judy teaches 5 classes per day for 5 weekdays, so she teaches 5 * 5 = 25 classes on weekdays.
She teaches 8 classes on Saturday.
Total classes in a week = 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students per week = 33 * 15 = 495 students.

"To find the total cost of the cell phones, we need to calculate the interest charged and add it to the original price. 

First, let's find the total cost of the cell phones without interest: 
5 cell phones * $150 per phone = $750

Next, let's calculate the interest charged for 3 months at 2% per month:
Interest per month = 2% of $750 = 0.02 * $750 = $15
Total interest for 3 months = $15 * 3 = $45

Now, let's add the interest to the original price:
Total cost = $750 + $45 = $795

Since Shiela is paying in installments, we need to divide the total cost by 3 months:
Monthly payment = $795 / 3 = $265

The top level has a square footage of 16. Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can find the square footage of the other levels as follows:

- Level 2: 16 / 2 = 8
- Level 3: 8 / 2 = 4
- Level 4: 4 / 2 = 2

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30

"To find the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days. 
So, the total number of cups of dog food the puppy will eat in the first 180 days is 1 * 180 = 180 cups.

The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day for the rest of its life. Since there are 365 days in a year, the puppy will eat 2 * (365 - 180) = 2 * 185 = 370 cups of dog food in the rest of the year.

The total number of cups of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year is 550 / 110 = 5.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
3. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

From point 2, we can express the amount of laundry David does in terms of Sarah's laundry: 
David's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 4
David's laundry = 400 / 4
David's laundry = 100 pounds

From point 1, we can express the amount of laundry Raymond does in terms of Sarah's laundry: 
Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package option.

For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers for $1, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better option.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages. The total cost is 9 packages * $1 per package = $9.

To find the cost of buying 18 flowers at the more expensive option, we calculate 18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages. The total cost is 6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.

The amount of money saved is $15 - $9 = $6.

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after the 10% increase for 5 years, and then calculate the increase for the next 3 years.

Initial salary: $600
Increase after 5 years: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 5 years: $600 + $60 = $660

Now, we need to calculate the increase for the next 3 years:
Increase after 6 years: 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 6 years: $660 + $66 = $726

Increase after 7 years: 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we first need to determine the total volume of the tomatoes before they were cooked. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the total volume of the sauce (32 ounces) is equal to half the volume of the raw tomatoes.

Let's call the total volume of the raw tomatoes ""x"". Since the sauce is half the volume of the raw tomatoes, we can set up the equation:

32 = x / 2

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 32 * 2
x = 64

So the total volume of the raw tomatoes is 64 ounces. Since each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces and contains 3 tomatoes, we can find the number of cans used by dividing the total volume of the raw tomatoes by the volume of each can:

Number of cans = 64 / 16
Number of cans = 4

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can find the total number of tomatoes used by multiplying the number of cans by 3:

Total tomatoes = 4 * 3
Total tomatoes = 12

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
Since the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, we add the number of doorbell rings made by each friend:

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one before bed). Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and 1 before bed, but he replaces the glass of water with dinner with a glass of soda. So, he drinks 3 glasses of water on weekends. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water on weekends.

Now, let's add the number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends: 20 (weekdays) + 6 (weekends) = 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the time it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

First, we find the rate at which the fog bank covers the city per minute: 3 miles / 10 minutes = 0.3 miles per minute.

Now, we divide the total distance of the city by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city per minute: 42 miles / 0.3 miles per minute = 140 minutes.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how many pieces Poppy placed, we need to calculate a quarter of 1000. 

A quarter of 1000 is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after Poppy placed 250 pieces. 

1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left.

Then, her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. 

A third of 750 is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after her mom placed 250 pieces. 

750 - 250 = 500 pieces left.

The final answer is: 500"
"To find the total number of cookies both Cody and Amir eat, we need to find out how many cookies Cody eats and add it to the number of cookies Amir eats.

Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, and Amir eats 5 cookies, we can multiply the number of cookies Amir eats by 3 to find out how many cookies Cody eats.

Cody eats 3 * 5 = 15 cookies.

Now, we add the number of cookies Cody eats to the number of cookies Amir eats to find the total number of cookies they eat together.

Total cookies = 15 (Cody's cookies) + 5 (Amir's cookies) = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to find the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The inner dimensions of each box are:
- Length: 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches (since the walls are 1 inch thick on both sides)
- Width: 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
- Height: 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
Volume = Length * Width * Height
= 3 * 4 * 2
= 24 cubic inches

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
Total Volume = 3 * 24
= 72 cubic inches

The final answer is: 72"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Monday and Tuesday: 2 episodes of 1-hour shows = 2 * 1 = 2 hours
- Wednesday: x episodes of 30-minute shows (we need to find x)
- Thursday: 1 episode of 1-hour show + 1 episode of 30-minute show = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 episodes of 1-hour shows = 2 * 1 = 2 hours

Total hours watched = 2 + x + 1.5 + 2 = 7

Combine like terms: 5.5 + x = 7

Subtract 5.5 from both sides: x = 1.5

Since x represents the number of 30-minute episodes, we need to convert it to hours: 1.5 * 0.5 = 0.75 hours

However, since the question asks for the number of 30-minute episodes, we need to convert 0.75 hours to 30-minute episodes: 0.75 * 2 = 1.5 episodes

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, he plans to bake 2x cookies.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. This can be represented by the equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110.

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation, we get 2x = 100.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get x = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total cost of the gas before the cashback, we multiply the price per gallon by the number of gallons: 
$3.00 per gallon * 10 gallons = $30.00

The cashback reward is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons, it would be:
$0.20 per gallon * 10 gallons = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cashback reward from the total cost of the gas:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each, we need to multiply the width by the length of each roll-up.

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 roll-ups long = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 roll-ups long = 42 roll-ups

Now, we need to find the total number of roll-ups eaten by both of them. 
Total roll-ups = Beatrice's roll-ups + Marcell's roll-ups = 48 + 42 = 90

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we need to divide the total number of roll-ups by 2 (since there are two people).
Average roll-ups = Total roll-ups / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed, and then multiply that by the amount of water taken on per 10 feet.

First, let's find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed in 64 seconds. We know it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. 

To find the rate of rowing, we can divide the distance by the time: 
20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second

Now, we can find the total distance rowed in 64 seconds:
64 seconds * 1.25 feet/second = 80 feet

Since the boat takes on water at a rate of 2 liters for every 10 feet, we need to find out how many sets of 10 feet are in 80 feet:
80 feet / 10 feet = 8 sets

Now, we can multiply the number of sets by the amount of water taken on per set:
8 sets * 2 liters/set = 16 liters

Ryan plants 2 flowers a day. After 15 days, he would have planted 2 * 15 = 30 flowers.

However, 5 flowers did not grow, so we need to subtract those from the total.

30 - 5 = 25

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

From point 1, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

From point 2, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This means that the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 300 / 50 = 6.

"To find the total cost of the lumber, we need to calculate the cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards and the 4 x 4 x 10 boards separately and then add them together.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 per board = $100.

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. 

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 per board.
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 per board.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.
The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 per board = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

"To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to first find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 13 = 20.

We know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120, and this is equal to 20 parts of the ratio. 

To find the value of one part, we divide the total amount by the total number of parts: 120 / 20 = 6.

Since the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is 7 parts, so we multiply 7 by the value of one part: 7 * 6 = 42.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Initially, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is:
2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

The next day, the total number of vehicles became 30. To find the number of vehicles added on the second day, subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total:
30 vehicles - 10 vehicles = 20 vehicles

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, to find the number of containers added on the second day, divide the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:
20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Lylah's original salary, then find Adrien's salary four years later, and finally find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later.

Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. If Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, then Lylah's salary four years ago can be found by dividing Adrien's salary by 1.3 (since 100% + 30% = 130%, or 1.3).

Lylah's original salary = $40000 / 1.3 = $30769.23

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%. To find his new salary, we multiply his original salary by 1.4 (since 100% + 40% = 140%, or 1.4).

Adrien's salary four years later = $40000 * 1.4 = $56000

Lylah's salary also increased by 40% over the same period. To find her new salary, we multiply her original salary by 1.4.

Lylah's salary four years later = $30769.23 * 1.4 = $43056.522

The total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later is the sum of their individual salaries.

Total salary four years later = $56000 + $43056.522 = $99056.522

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, the total number of sheets he uses in a week is:
2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of sheets used in a week by 4 to get the total number of sheets used in a month:
60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then add them together.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 
Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples.
Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each person brought:
Morisette: 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits
Kael: 10 apples + 4 oranges = 14 fruits

The total number of fruits they have is 13 + 14 = 27."
"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to break down her sleep into different parts.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

The rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday) she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept for each part of the week:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday and Wednesday: 2 days * 6 hours = 12 hours
- Thursday to Sunday: 5 days * 7 hours = 35 hours

Now, let's add up the total hours she slept throughout the week:
8 + 12 + 35 = 55

The final answer is: 55"
"To find the total distance Rosie can run, we need to calculate the distance she runs at each speed and add them together.

First, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours (7 - 3 = 4):
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distances together to find the total distance Rosie can run:
Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total Distance = 50 miles

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. This means she stamps 1/3 * 60 = 20 letters.
2. After stamping 20 letters, the number of letters needing stamps is 60 - 20 = 40.
3. We are given that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.
4. Since Jennie stamped 20 letters, the number of letters in the already-stamped pile before she started is 30 - 20 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as 'x'. 

Initially, Julia had 0 spoons. After buying a package, she had x spoons. Then, her husband gave her 5 more spoons, so she had x + 5 spoons. 

After using 3 spoons, she had (x + 5) - 3 = x + 2 spoons. 

Later, when she set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. So, we can set up the equation: x + 2 = 12.

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: x = 12 - 2.

x = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of sausages, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages. 

Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 
He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages: 
38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we need to find the number of friends Amy has and add it to the number of friends Lily has.

Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily made 50 friends, Amy made 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

Now, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. Since each pepper costs $15, a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.

2. An orange costs 5 dollars less than what a watermelon costs. So, an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.

3. Dillon is buying 4 watermelons, so the total cost of watermelons is 4 * $45 = $180.

4. Dillon is buying 20 peppers, and each pepper costs $15, so the total cost of peppers is 20 * $15 = $300.

5. Dillon is buying 10 oranges, and each orange costs $40, so the total cost of oranges is 10 * $40 = $400.

6. To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we add the cost of watermelons, peppers, and oranges: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total amount charged to patients, then subtract the cost of the doctors' time from the total amount charged to patients.

First, let's find the total time spent by doctors:
500 patients/day * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes/day

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total minutes to hours:
12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours/day

The cost of the doctors' time is:
200 hours/day * $150/hour = $30000/day

Now, let's find the total amount charged to patients:
500 patients/day * $200/hour * (24 minutes / 60 hours) = 500 * $200 * 0.4 = $80000/day

The profit is the difference between the total amount charged to patients and the cost of the doctors' time:
$80000/day - $30000/day = $50000/day

The final answer is: $50000"
"To find the number of elves left, we need to follow the steps:

1. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. 
   Since a third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20, 20 elves quit.
   So, the remaining elves are 60 - 20 = 40.

2. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins.
   So, the remaining elves are 40 - 10 = 30.

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides each person took and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she rode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides is 4 (Pam's rides) + 6 (Fred's rides) = 10 rides.

Each ride costs 6 tickets, so the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first determine how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked 4 * 6 = 24 miles on Tuesday.

The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. We already know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday, so the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday: 41 - 28 = 13 miles.

"To find the total cost of the order, we need to calculate the cost of the items first.

Cost of subs: 2 subs * $7.50 = $15.00
Cost of chips: 2 bags * $1.50 = $3.00
Cost of cookies: 2 cookies * $1.00 = $2.00
Total cost of items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we need to add the 20% delivery fee to the total cost of the items.
Delivery fee: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Total cost with delivery fee: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we need to add the $5.00 tip to the total cost with the delivery fee.
Total cost with tip: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

"To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed in both tests and subtract that from the total number of questions in both tests.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

Time taken to complete the first test = Total questions / Rate per hour
Time taken to complete the first test = 75 / 5
Time taken to complete the first test = 15 hours

Since Mark had 8 hours, he completed the first test in 8 hours, not 15. So, let's calculate how many questions he completed in 8 hours.

Questions completed in 8 hours = Rate per hour * Time
Questions completed in 8 hours = 5 * 8
Questions completed in 8 hours = 40

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.

Time taken to complete the second test = Total questions / Rate per hour
Time taken to complete the second test = 100 / 5
Time taken to complete the second test = 20 hours

Since Mark had 6 hours, he completed 6/5 of the second test. 

Questions completed in 6 hours = Rate per hour * Time
Questions completed in 6 hours = 5 * 6
Questions completed in 6 hours = 30

Total questions completed = Questions completed in the first test + Questions completed in the second test
Total questions completed = 40 + 30
Total questions completed = 70

Total questions in both tests = 75 + 100
Total questions in both tests = 175

Questions left incomplete = Total questions in both tests - Total questions completed
Questions left incomplete = 175 - 70
Questions left incomplete = 105

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to find the number of semi-automatic cars. 

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

"Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q.

We are given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.

We are also given that there are twice as many babies as queens, so B = 2Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 2B and B = 2Q into the equation W + B + Q = 700, we get:

2B + B + Q = 700
3B + Q = 700

Substituting B = 2Q into the equation 3B + Q = 700, we get:

3(2Q) + Q = 700
6Q + Q = 700
7Q = 700

Dividing both sides by 7, we get:

Q = 100

Now that we know Q = 100, we can find B by substituting Q into the equation B = 2Q:

B = 2(100)
B = 200

Now that we know B = 200, we can find W by substituting B into the equation W = 2B:

W = 2(200)
W = 400

The number of worker bees is 400."
"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week, we need to calculate the total hours he would work in a week and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day, if he spent his video game time working instead, he would work 2 hours a day.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours he would work in a week is 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week.

His hourly wage is $10, so the total amount of money he would earn in a week is 14 hours/week * $10/hour = $140/week.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of food items and non-food items separately and then add them together.

Food items: 
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
Total cost of food items: 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 dollars

Non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
Total cost of non-food items: 3 + 4 = 7 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
Tax = 10% of 7 dollars = 0.1 * 7 = 0.7 dollars

Now, we add the tax to the cost of non-food items:
Total cost of non-food items with tax = 7 + 0.7 = 7.7 dollars

Now, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax:
Total cost = 8 + 7.7 = 15.7 dollars

The final answer is: 15.7"
"To find the total number of clients, we need to add the clients Kim already has to the potential clients he is talking to. 

Total clients = 3 (existing clients) + 5 (potential clients) = 8

Since each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths, the total number of bottles of bleach needed is 2 * 8 = 16, and the total number of packs of cloths needed is 8.

The total cost of bleach is 16 * $2 = $32, and the total cost of cloths is 8 * $5 = $40.

The total expenses are the sum of the cost of bleach and the cost of cloths: $32 + $40 = $72.

Since Kim's total income is $92, the profit will be the difference between his income and expenses: $92 - $72 = $20.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.
3. The number of bees that have left the hive so far is 30 (initially left) + 30 (left in the next 6 hours) = 60 bees. The number of bees that have returned so far is 15.
4. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 that left the hive fly from the hive and leave. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave the hive.
5. The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is 60 (initially left) + 60 (left in the next 6 hours) = 120 bees. The number of bees that have returned so far is still 15.
6. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. So, 120 - 15 = 105 bees return to the hive.

"To find out who wins the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet for both Steve and Tim. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, we can convert their distances as follows:

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school:

Steve's time: distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes to get home and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve wins the race. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time:

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total number of fries eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
   Now, the total number of fries eaten by Dave, the seagull, and the pigeons is 21 + 9 = 30.
4. A raccoon ate two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's call the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it 'x'. 
   After the pigeons ate, the remaining fries are x - 30. 
   The raccoon ate 2/3 of (x - 30), which is (2/3)(x - 30).
   The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30).
   Simplifying this, we get (1/3)(x - 30).
5. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind. 
   So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.
   Solving for x, we get (1/3)(x - 30) = 6.
   Multiplying both sides by 3, we get x - 30 = 18.
   Adding 30 to both sides, we get x = 48.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to convert the length of the baguettes to inches and then add up the lengths of all the baked goods.

First, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of the rolls, croissants, and baguettes in inches:
- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add up the lengths of all the baked goods in inches:
1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches

Finally, let's convert the total length from inches to feet:
3360 inches / 12 inches/foot = 280 feet

"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 80 = 160 yards. She does this 34 times. So, the total distance Kelly ran is 200 + (34 * 160) = 200 + 5440 = 5640 yards.

Since 5640 is greater than 3000, Kelly is the winner.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract the distance Blake ran from the distance Kelly ran: 5640 - 3000 = 2640 yards.

"To find the depth of the water on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The initial depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet.
2. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.
3. On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = (24 * 2) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we need to add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish he caught.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.

Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Total fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin = 19 + 13 = 32

"To find the cost of the marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price. 

The original price of the marbles is $20. 

After 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
The new price after 2 months is $20 + $4 = $24.

After 4 months, the price increases by 20% of $24, which is 0.20 * $24 = $4.80.
The new price after 4 months is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

After 6 months, the price increases by 20% of $28.80, which is 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76.
The new price after 6 months is $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can write an equation:

S = 2B

In 2 years, their ages will be B + 2 and S + 2. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the second equation, we get:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"

"To find the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the miles he walks on weekdays and weekends separately and then add them together.

Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. 
5 days * 20 miles/day = 100 miles

He walks 10 miles a day on Saturday and Sunday, which is 2 days.
2 days * 10 miles/day = 20 miles

Total miles walked in a week = miles walked on weekdays + miles walked on weekends
Total miles walked in a week = 100 miles + 20 miles
Total miles walked in a week = 120 miles

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hat is $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times as much as the hat, so it is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
2. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
3. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo.
4. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.

From point 3, we know Sally Four is 8 years old. 

From point 2, we know Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

From point 1, we know Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of three birds: Sally Four (8), Granny Red (16), and Sally Two (19). 

The only bird left is the one at the Caboose, which is Sally, but we don't know which Sally. However, since Sally Two and Sally Four are already accounted for, the only other Sally left is Sally Thirtytwo, which we already know is 8 years old.

So, the total age of the four birds is 8 + 16 + 19 + 8 = 51.

"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes, then add the time it takes to cut one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)

Total time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Total time to cut one potato: 5/60 minutes = 0.0833 minutes

Now, let's multiply the time it takes to peel and cut one potato by the total number of potatoes:
Total time to peel all potatoes: 1.5 minutes * 60 potatoes = 90 minutes
Total time to cut all potatoes: 0.0833 minutes * 60 potatoes = 5 minutes

Now, add the time it takes to peel and cut all the potatoes:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of gallons they made as 'g'. 
2. The cost of lemons for 'g' gallons is $3g.
3. The cost of sugar for 'g' gallons is $2g.
4. The total cost is $3g + $2g = $5g.
5. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so they make $0.50 * 20 = $10 per gallon.
6. The total revenue is $10g.
7. The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $25. So, $10g - $5g = $25.
8. Simplifying the equation, we get $5g = $25.
9. To find the number of gallons, we divide both sides by $5, which gives us g = $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.
10. Now that we know they made 5 gallons, we can find the cost of lemons by multiplying the cost per gallon by the number of gallons: $3 * 5 = $15.

"Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is 4x. 

The number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, so the number of pink calla lilies is 5x. However, we are given that the number of pink calla lilies is 200. Therefore, we can set up the equation 5x = 200.

To find the value of x, we need to solve the equation 5x = 200. 

Divide both sides of the equation by 5 to isolate x: 
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the number of red roses. The number of red roses is 4x, so the number of red roses is 4 * 40 = 160.

Mark - 2 = (1/2)Jan - 5

Since we know Jan is 30, we can substitute 30 for Jan in the equation:
Mark - 2 = (1/2)(30) - 5
Mark - 2 = 15 - 5
Mark - 2 = 10
Mark = 12

Now that we know Mark is 12, we can find Jean's age using point 1:
Jean = Mark + 2
Jean = 12 + 2
Jean = 14

"To find the total time for the well-rounded team, we multiply the time per runner by the number of runners: 55 seconds * 4 = 220 seconds.

For the less well-rounded team, the first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. 

To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we add the times of all the runners: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then find the difference between these two probabilities.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 or 25%.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. The total number of rats is 3r.

2. There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. The total number of hamsters is 10.

3. The total number of straw distributed among the small rodents (rats and hamsters) is 160. The total number of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50. The remaining straw is given to the rats.

4. The total number of straw given to the rats is 160 - 50 = 110.

5. Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the total number of rats is 110 / 6 = 18.33. However, the number of rats must be a whole number, so we need to find the number of rats that would result in a total of 110 straw pieces when each rat is given 6 pieces.

6. Since 3r = 18.33, we can try different values of r to find the one that results in a whole number of rats. However, we can also try to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 3, which is 6. 

7. Since 18.33 is not a whole number, we can try to find the closest multiple of 6 that is greater than 18.33. The closest multiple of 6 is 18, but 18 * 3 = 54, which is greater than 18.33. However, we can try 18 - 1 = 17, which is not a multiple of 3. We can try 18 - 2 = 16, which is also not a multiple of 3. We can try 18 - 3 = 15, which is not a multiple of 3. We can try 18 - 4 = 14, which is not a multiple of 3. We can try 18 - 5 = 13, which is not a multiple of 3. We can try 18 - 6 = 12, which is not a multiple of 3. We can try 18 - 7 = 11, which is not a multiple of 3. We can try 18 - 8 = 10, which is not a multiple of 3. We can try 18 - 9 = 9, which is not a multiple of 3. We can try 18 - 10 = 8, which is not a multiple of 3. We can try 18 - 11 = 7, which is not a multiple of 3. We can try 18 - 12 = 6, which is a multiple of 3. 

8. Since 6 is a multiple of 3, we can try 6 * 3 = 18, but 18 * 6 = 108, which is less than 110. We can try 6 * 4 = 24, but 24 * 6 = 144, which is also less than 110. We can try 6 * 5 = 30, but 30 * 6 = 180, which is greater than 110. We can try 6 * 4.83 = 29.98, but 29.98 * 6 = 179.88, which is greater than 110.

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the principal amount.

The monthly interest rate is 2%, which is 0.02 as a decimal. 

The principal amount is $100.

The interest for the first month is: $100 * 0.02 = $2
The interest for the second month is: $100 + $2 = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04
The interest for the third month is: $102 + $2.04 = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808

The total interest is: $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208

The total amount Mandy should pay is: $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208

Rounded to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is: $106.12

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total cost of buying the bags of wheat and the total cost of transporting them. Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'.

The cost of buying the bags is $20x.
The cost of transporting the bags is $2x.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of buying and transporting the bags: $20x + $2x = $22x.

The trader sold the bags at a rate of $30 each, so the total revenue is $30x.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $30x - $22x = $8x.

We are given that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation: $8x = $400.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8: x = $400 / $8 = 50.

The trader sold 50 bags."
"To find the total cost of the tickets, we multiply the cost of one ticket by the number of tickets: 
$20.25 * 3 = $60.75

They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, so the cost of food is:
$20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75

The cost of the rides is:
$33 * 2 = $66

The total cost is the sum of the cost of tickets, food, and rides:
$60.75 + $15.75 + $66 = $142.50

Since they split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
$142.50 / 3 = $47.50

The final answer is $47.50."
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total minutes he collects peaches and then multiply it by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the total minutes by the number of peaches per minute:

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the total pounds of insects the flock needs per day, we first need to find the total pounds of insects they need per week. 

The total pounds of insects the flock needs per week is 3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the pounds of insects the flock needs per day by dividing the total pounds per week by 7.

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees.

He plants 10 trees a year, so in 10 years, he will plant 10 * 10 = 100 trees.

He chops down 2 trees a year, so in 10 years, he will chop down 2 * 10 = 20 trees.

The net change in the number of trees is 100 (planted) - 20 (chopped down) = 80 trees.

So, after 10 years, Tom will have 50 (initial trees) + 80 (net change) = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we need to calculate 30% of 130.

30% of 130 = 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees.

So, the number of trees that die is 39.

The number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find the number of pink and white flamingos, we need to break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard. So, the number of white flamingos is 6.

The number of pink flamingos left is 18 - 6 = 12.

On Sunday, the neighbors added another 18 pink flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is now 12 + 18 = 30.

The number of white flamingos remains the same, which is 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many crayons Violetta can buy, we need to divide the amount of money she has by the cost of one crayon. 

Number of crayons = Total money / Cost of one crayon
Number of crayons = $20 / $2
Number of crayons = 10

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color.

Total number of crayons she can buy = 2 * 5
Total number of crayons she can buy = 10

Since she can buy 10 crayons in total and she needs 5 different colors, she will buy 2 of each color.

Now, let's find out how much change she will get. 

Change = Total money - Total cost of crayons
Change = $20 - (2 * 5 * $2)
Change = $20 - $20
Change = $0

Violetta will get $0 change."
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser.

Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. 

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12

Total pounds of carrots distributed = 80 pounds

Now, subtract the total pounds of carrots distributed from the initial amount:

Initial amount of carrots = 200 pounds
Total pounds of carrots distributed = 80 pounds

Pounds of carrots not used = Initial amount of carrots - Total pounds of carrots distributed
Pounds of carrots not used = 200 - 80
Pounds of carrots not used = 120

"To find the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and add them to the initial number of cards.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the initial number of cards: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months: (60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards from each month and the initial cards: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mark edits 1000 sentences each week.
2. Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.
3. Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence.
4. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.
5. The total amount Mark makes from Publisher A is 500 * 5 = 2500 cents.
6. The total amount Mark makes from Publisher B is 500 * 10 = 5000 cents.
7. The total amount Mark makes in a week is 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water he gets every day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

"To find the total amount John made that year, we need to calculate his new salary after the 5% raise and then multiply it by the number of weeks he works in a year.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his current salary:
5% of 2000 = 0.05 * 2000 = 100

New salary = Current salary + Raise
New salary = 2000 + 100 = 2100

Since John works every week of the year, there are 52 weeks in a year. 
Total amount made in a year = New salary * Number of weeks
Total amount made in a year = 2100 * 52
Total amount made in a year = 109200

Adding the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to the total amount made in a year:
Total amount made in a year = 109200 + 5000
Total amount made in a year = 114200

The final answer is: 114200"

1. Slices used for sandwiches: 
   - Number of days: 7 (since he ate a sandwich every day for a week)
   - Slices per sandwich: 2
   - Total slices for sandwiches: 7 * 2 = 14

2. Slices used for omelets: 
   - Number of days: 3 (since he ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week)
   - Slices per omelet: 2 + 1 = 3 (since he used one more slice per omelet than per sandwich)
   - Total slices for omelets: 3 * 3 = 9

3. Slices used for macaroni and cheese: 
   - Number of slices: 8

Now, let's add the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish together:

"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the total number of pens she had initially and the total number of pens she bought.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so the total number of pens she had initially is 22 + 10 = 32.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so the total number of blue pens she bought is 6 * 9 = 54.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so the total number of red pens she bought is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of pens she bought is 54 + 12 = 66.

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, we need to find the lowest score of the first 5 tests. The lowest score is 71.

We subtract the lowest score from the total score of the first 5 tests to get the new total: 
338 - 71 = 267

Now, we add the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to the new total to get the total score for the semester: 
267 + x = 558

To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we subtract 267 from 558: 
x = 558 - 267
x = 291

The final answer is: 291"
"To find the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike, we need to calculate the total kilometers for the first four weeks and the total kilometers for the next three weeks, then add them together.

For the first four weeks, Michael rode 5 times a week for 4 weeks. 
5 times/week * 4 weeks = 20 times
Each time, he rode 25 kilometers.
20 times * 25 kilometers/time = 500 kilometers

For the next three weeks, Michael rode 2 times a week for 3 weeks.
2 times/week * 3 weeks = 6 times
Each time, he rode 60 kilometers.
6 times * 60 kilometers/time = 360 kilometers

Now, we add the total kilometers for both periods.
500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers

The final answer is: 860"
"To find the total weight of the chocolate bars, we need to multiply the number of chocolate bars by their weight. 

Number of chocolate bars: 25
Weight of each chocolate bar: 40g
Total weight of chocolate bars: 25 * 40g = 1000g

To find the weight of each candied apple, we need to divide the weight of a chocolate bar by 2, since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.

Weight of each chocolate bar: 40g
Weight of each candied apple: 40g / 2 = 20g

To find the total weight of the candied apples, we need to multiply the number of candied apples by their weight.

Number of candied apples: 80
Weight of each candied apple: 20g
Total weight of candied apples: 80 * 20g = 1600g

To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples.

Total weight of chocolate bars: 1000g
Total weight of candied apples: 1600g

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates will cost 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

2. We are told that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

3. Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

4. To find the cost of each cup, we need to divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups: $34,800 / 240 = $145.

"To find out how much money Sara needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. 

The cost of the jacket is $30, and the cost of 2 pairs of shoes is 2 * $20 = $40. 

So, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn. 

Let's calculate how much more money she needs: $70 - $10 = $60.

Now, let's calculate how much she earns from babysitting: $5 * 4 = $20.

To find out how much more she needs to earn from mowing the lawn, we subtract the amount she earns from babysitting from the total amount she needs: $60 - $20 = $40.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we need to divide the amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn by the amount she earns per mowing: $40 / $4 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We know that W = R + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can set up the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle first. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(l + w)
P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Now that we have the perimeter, we can find the time Gary spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed:

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The first day, Sloane counts 100 customers.
- The second day, she counts 50 more customers than the first day, so she counts 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
- The total number of customers by the third day is 500.

To find the number of customers on the third day, we need to subtract the total customers on the first two days from the total by the third day. 

Total customers by the third day = Customers on the third day + Customers on the first two days
500 = Customers on the third day + (100 + 150)
500 = Customers on the third day + 250

Now, we need to isolate the customers on the third day. 

Customers on the third day = 500 - 250
Customers on the third day = 250

The final answer is: 250"
"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of change of water in each pool is -4 gallons/minute.

The change in the amount of water in the small pool over 4 minutes is -4 * 4 = -16 gallons.

The change in the amount of water in the big pool over 4 minutes is -4 * 4 = -16 gallons.

The current amount of water in the small pool is x - 16 gallons.

The current amount of water in the big pool is 2x - 16 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

The initial amount of water in the small pool is 24 gallons. 

The current amount of water in the small pool is 24 - 16 = 8 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn, which is the cost of the shoes and the belt. 

Total cost = cost of shoes + cost of belt

Total cost = $352.00

Now, we need to divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours to work = 44

"To find the remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months. 

Janeth pays $165 per month for 12 months, so the total amount she pays is:
$165 * 12 = $1980

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. The additional amount is:
10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200

So, the total amount Janeth needs to pay is:
$2000 (initial amount) + $200 (additional amount) = $2200

Since Janeth pays $1980 in 12 months, the remaining balance will be:
$2200 (total amount) - $1980 (paid amount) = $220

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age is 2 * 21 = 42 years.
3. Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's current age is 3 * 21 = 63 years.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored. 

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Naomi scored 68 points. Half of 68 is 34. 10 more than 34 is 44. So Yuri scored 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. Naomi scored 68 points. 17 more than 68 is 85. So Brianna scored 85 points.

The total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points scored by all four students. 

251 - 197 = 54

"To find the total number of letters Mike receives, we need to multiply the number of pen pals he has left by the number of letters each sends per week. 

Number of pen pals left = 5 - 2 = 3
Letters sent per week per pen pal = 2
Total letters received per week = 3 * 2 = 6

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

Total letters written per week = 6 (received) + 6 (sent) = 12

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages written per week is:
Total pages written per week = 12 * 5 = 60

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time spent writing per week is:

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries.

Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin. So, Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin some fries, and then Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, Colby took 2 fries from Griffin.

After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin was left with 9 - 2 = 7 fries.

Since Griffin ended up with 27 fries, Ginger must have given Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

Cost for 5 weeks = $6000 * 5 = $30,000

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. 
Discount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3000
Amount Jean paid = $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find out how much each person paid, we need to first calculate the total cost of the party supplies. 

Total cost = cost of cake + cost of presents + cost of decorations + cost of invitations + cost of goodie bags
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total. 

Cost per person = Total cost / Number of people
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, each weighing 50 pounds. 
Total weight = 4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

The cost per pound of onions is $1.50.
Total cost = Total weight * Cost per pound = 200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

2. On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

3. To find the total number of cookies Sue ate, we add the cookies she ate on Monday and Tuesday: 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

4. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, so the total number of cookies her sister ate is 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

5. To find the difference in the number of cookies Sue and her sister ate, we subtract the sister's total from Sue's total: 46 - 18 = 28 cookies.

6. Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we multiply the difference in the number of cookies by the calories per cookie to find the difference in calories: 28 * 200 = 5600 calories.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to find the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of students in the school is 100%. 

There are 3 classes with 20 students each, so the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

Since the total number of girls in the school is 30, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the third class has 20 students and 3 of them are girls, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.
- Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and three fewer cougars than the previous night.

Let's denote the number of cougars killed today as x. Since Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, the number of wolves killed today is 3 * 12 = 36.

The total number of wolves killed is the sum of the wolves killed last night and today: 10 + 36 = 46.

The total number of cougars killed is the sum of the cougars killed last night and today: 15 + 12 = 27.

The total number of animals killed is the sum of the wolves and cougars killed: 46 + 27 = 73.

"To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and subtract that from 30. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Since Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply 21 by 4 to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. 
21 * 4 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

Number of cows added to each stall = Total cows bought / Number of stalls
= 40 / 10
= 4

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8.

Number of cows in 8 stalls = 24 * 8
= 192

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the total weight of the wood and then find 30% of that weight to determine how much the termites ate. 

First, we find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we divide the total height by 10 to find the number of sections, then multiply by the weight per section.

Total height = 200 feet
Number of sections = Total height / 10 = 200 / 10 = 20
Weight per section = 400 pounds
Total weight = Number of sections * Weight per section = 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds

Next, we find 30% of the total weight to determine how much the termites ate.

Percentage of wood eaten by termites = 30%
Weight eaten by termites = Total weight * Percentage of wood eaten by termites = 8000 * 0.30 = 2400 pounds

However, the question asks for the weight of the redwood, not the weight eaten by termites. So, we subtract the weight eaten by termites from the total weight.

Weight of the redwood = Total weight - Weight eaten by termites = 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.

Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as 'x'. Then, the number of bananas Jamal has is 'x + 4' (since he has 4 more bananas than apples).

Since Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, the number of bananas Andrea has is (x + 4) / 2.

Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so the number of apples Andrea has is x + 8. We are given that Andrea has 52 apples, so we can set up the equation:

x + 8 = 52

Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us:

x = 44

Now that we know Jamal has 44 apples, we can find the number of bananas he has:

Number of bananas Jamal has = x + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so the number of bananas Andrea has is:

Number of bananas Andrea has = (x + 4) / 2 = (44 + 4) / 2 = 48 / 2 = 24

Now, let's find the total number of fruits:

Total number of fruits = Number of apples Andrea has + Number of apples Jamal has + Number of bananas Andrea has + Number of bananas Jamal has
= 52 + 44 + 24 + 48
= 168

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we first need to determine how many cups are needed for each day. 

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 1 dozen (12) cookies require 2 cups of flour, we can find out how many cups are needed for 36 cookies by dividing 36 by 12 and then multiplying by 2. 

36 / 12 = 3, then 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour are needed for today.

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. We can use the same method to find out how many cups are needed for 30 cookies. 

30 / 12 = 2.5, then 2.5 * 2 = 5 cups of flour are needed for tomorrow.

To find the total amount of flour needed, we add the flour needed for today and tomorrow. 

6 + 5 = 11 cups of flour.

"To find the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first find two thirds of 9,300. 

Two thirds of 9,300 can be calculated as (2/3) * 9,300. 

To calculate this, we multiply 9,300 by 2 and then divide by 3.

9,300 * 2 = 18,600
18,600 / 3 = 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62

3. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has.
   First, we find twice the number of trees Ferdinand has: 2 * 3 = 6
   Then, we add 5 to that number: 6 + 5 = 11
   So, Harry has 11 trees.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard.
Harry has 11 trees, and Ferdinand has 3 trees.
The difference is 11 - 3 = 8

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is the sum of the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to add 10 to both x and y, and then add the results together. 

(x + 10) + (y + 10) = x + y + 20

Since x + y = 20, we can substitute this into the equation:

"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S.

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can write the equation:
R = 6S

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write the equation:
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Substituting R = 6S into the second equation, we get:
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation, we get:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:
3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
S = 6

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles.

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Ali has 22 medals.
2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
4. They have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, so the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. Let's call the total number of medals given out ""x"". We can write this as an equation: 39 = x/10.
5. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 10: x = 39 * 10.
6. x = 390.

The final answer is: 390"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are available in total, we multiply the number of packets by the number of chocolate bars in each packet: 8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars.

Since each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, we multiply the number of adults by the number of chocolate bars each adult gets: 4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars.

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars.

These 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among 8 children. To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars/child.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

Total time worked = 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her hourly wage:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed, we need to first calculate their points after the fourth round.

Initially, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point and still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed: 
Mike has 22 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points. 
So, the total points of all three players is 22 + 18 + 43 = 83. 

The final answer is: 83"
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to determine how many oranges the sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, so the youngest son is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. 

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges initially. To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges: 15 - 12 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total count of activities, we need to calculate the number of each activity done on the first and second day and then add them together.

Day 1:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Day 2:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add the activities from both days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Total count of activities: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

"To find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day. 

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 3 meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). So, each person consumes 0.2 * 3 = 0.6 kg of rice per day.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.6 * 5 = 3 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per day (3 kg).

42 kg / 3 kg/day = 14 days

Since we want to find out how many weeks the rice will last, we need to convert the number of days to weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide 14 days by 7.

14 days / 7 days/week = 2 weeks

The 42 kg bag of rice will last 2 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold and subtract that from his target.

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he didn't sell any crates on those days. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday.

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65

Since he was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 working days. His target for the week is 120 crates, but he only had 5 working days, so we need to calculate his target for 5 days.

Target for 5 days = 120 / 7 * 5 = 85.71 (approximately), but since you can't sell a fraction of a crate, we'll round down to 85 crates for 5 days.

Now, let's find out how many crates he was off from his target:

Crates off from target = Target for 5 days - Total crates sold
= 85 - 65
= 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to determine the total number of bids made by Carmen and the total amount she paid. 

Since there are 3 other people who bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them, the total number of bids made by Carmen is 3 (bids by others) + 1 (Carmen's initial bid) + 3 (Carmen's bids after others) = 7 bids.

The initial bid is $200, and each subsequent bid is $50 more than the previous one. 

The total amount paid by Carmen can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: 

Total amount = (n/2) * (a + l), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term.

In this case, n = 7, a = 200, and l = 200 + (7-1)*50 = 450.

Total amount = (7/2) * (200 + 450)
Total amount = 3.5 * 650
Total amount = 2275

The final answer is: $2275"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total miles driven, the total cost of driving, and the total bonus.

1. Total miles driven per day: 30 miles * 2 (to and from work) = 60 miles
2. Total miles driven per week: 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week
3. Total miles driven per year: 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year
4. Total cost of driving per year: 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000/year
5. Total bonus per year: $150/week * 4 weeks/month * 12 months/year = $7200/year
6. Total cost per year: $30000/year + $7200/year = $37200/year

"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. A standard piece of paper has two sides: front and back.
2. When folded, the paper is divided into four sections: left front, left back, right front, and right back.
3. Since each section can be used for printing a page, we need to determine how many sections are created when folding a 32-page tabloid.

When folding a 32-page tabloid, the paper is folded once, creating two sections on the left and two sections on the right. 

- The left side has 16 sections (left front and left back for each page).
- The right side has 16 sections (right front and right back for each page).

Since each section is a separate piece of paper, we need to count the total number of sections.

Total sections = sections on the left + sections on the right
Total sections = 16 + 16
Total sections = 32

However, this counts each piece of paper twice (once for the left side and once for the right side). Since each piece of paper is used twice, we need to divide the total number of sections by 2.

Total pieces of paper = Total sections / 2
Total pieces of paper = 32 / 2
Total pieces of paper = 16

"Let's break down the information given:

- Total books = 250
- Unsold books = 50
- Books sold this year = 45
- Books sold in the first year = 2 * Books sold this year = 2 * 45 = 90
- Books sold in the second year = Total books - Unsold books - Books sold this year - Books sold in the first year
= 250 - 50 - 45 - 90
= 65

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
Total money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book
= 65 * 20
= 1300

"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since there are 4 weeks in April, we can calculate his total hours worked in April: 
50 hours/week * 4 weeks = 200 hours

Now, let's calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage: 
200 hours * $10/hour = $2000

Next, we add the weekly bonus for 4 weeks: 
$300/week * 4 weeks = $1200

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each:
   Cost of suits = 6 * $100 = $600

2. He buys 3 suitcases at $50 each:
   Cost of suitcases = 3 * $50 = $150

3. The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
   Cost of a business suit = $100
   5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
   Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

4. Total cost of the items so far:
   Total cost = $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950

5. Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so he has a total budget of $6000 - $2000 = $4000 for the rest of the expenses.

6. To find out how much he has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we subtract the total cost of the items from his remaining budget:

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D, the number of players on the offense as O, and the number of players on the special teams as S.

We are given that there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so O = 2D.

We are also given that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so S = D/2.

The total number of players on the team is 105, which is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. Therefore, we can write the equation:

O + D + S = 105

Substituting the expressions for O and S in terms of D, we get:

2D + D + D/2 = 105

Combine like terms:

(4D + D)/2 = 105

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to find the volume of the pool first. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length (l) = 6 feet
- Width (w) = 4 feet
- Height (h) = 5 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:
V = lwh
= 6 * 4 * 5
= 120 cubic feet

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people at the party was 25 + 15 = 40.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. To find the number of people who left, we multiply the total number of people by 1/4:

1/4 * 40 = 10

So, 10 people left the party.

Since 22 men stayed at the party, and there were initially 25 men, the number of men who left is:

25 - 22 = 3

Since 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is:

10 - 3 = 7

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 of them left. To find the number of women who stayed, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this:

3x + 2 = 26

where x is the number of pencils in each box. To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x:

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 * 8 = 24 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils they have together is 24 + 46 = 70.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all their pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each box:

Number of boxes = Total number of pencils / Number of pencils per box
= 70 / 8
= 8.75

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the added cream. 

First, let's find the weakening effect of one ice cube. We know that each ice cube weakens the coffee by 12 milliliters. To find the weakening effect of 65 degrees, we need to find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. 

Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to find the number of ice cubes: 65 / 13 = 5. 

Now, we know that 5 ice cubes weaken the coffee by 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters. 

Next, we need to find the weakening effect of the added cream. We know that the cream weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters. 

To find the total weakening effect, we add the weakening effect of the ice cubes and the cream: 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 7 * 2
x = 14

So, the 5 people brought in 14 old records.

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to find the number of junior programmers, the number of senior programmers, and then calculate the total amount paid to each group.

First, we find the number of junior programmers:
Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * Total number of employees
= 2/5 * 100
= 40

Since the number of senior programmers is the remaining employees, we subtract the number of junior programmers from the total number of employees:
Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, we find the monthly salary of a senior programmer:
Monthly salary of a senior programmer = Monthly salary of a junior programmer + $400
= $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, we can calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately:
Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Monthly salary of a junior programmer
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Monthly salary of a senior programmer
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

Now, we add the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers to find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:
Total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000

Then, 8 more people got in, so the total became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6. 
We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 20. 

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: 
x = 20 - 6
x = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many lollipops Oscar has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
2. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
3. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
4. He eats 3 more lollipops that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
5. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first find the total number of percentage points it needs to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs to charge 100% - 60% = 40% more.

Since the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can find the time it takes to charge 40% by multiplying 40 by 3. 

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 / 60 = 2 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to follow the order of operations:

1. Erin starts with 7 lollipops.
2. Her mother gives her 10 more lollipops, so now she has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.
3. Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so we subtract 3 from 17: 17 - 3 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip, apply the rewards and the coupon to the current shopping trip, and then subtract the total from the amount spent on the current shopping trip.

The customer spent $80 on the last shopping trip, so they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. Since they had 4 rewards, they used $4 off the price. 

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8. 

So, the total discount applied is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

The amount the customer paid is $43 (price) - $12 (discount) = $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"To determine which job pays more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

Job A: 
- Gross income: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year
- Tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B: 
- Gross income: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income before tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Since $32,400 is less than $24,000, Job A pays more. To find the difference, we subtract the net income of Job B from the net income of Job A:
$24,000 - $32,400 = -$8,400

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of ruined castles, we need to calculate 40% of 220. 

40% of 220 = 0.4 * 220 = 88

"To find the total cost of each offer, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment.

Furniture United's offer:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Cozy Homes' offer:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two offers:

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price after the first increase and then the price after the decrease.

Initial price per share: $8
Increase percentage: 50%
Price after the first increase = Initial price + (Initial price * Increase percentage)
= $8 + ($8 * 0.5)
= $8 + $4
= $12

Now, we need to calculate the price after the 25% decrease in the second year.
Decrease percentage: 25%
Price after the second year = Price after the first increase - (Price after the first increase * Decrease percentage)
= $12 - ($12 * 0.25)
= $12 - $3
= $9

Since Maria bought 8 shares, we need to multiply the price after the second year by 8 to find the total value of her shares.
Total value = Price after the second year * Number of shares
= $9 * 8
= $72

"Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the last group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Since the last group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the last group by subtracting 10 from x:

x - 10 = 70 - 10
= 60

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as Ch. We know that Ch = 2C, since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows. We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so C + Ch = 60.

Substituting Ch = 2C into the equation C + Ch = 60, we get C + 2C = 60, which simplifies to 3C = 60. Dividing both sides by 3, we get C = 20.

Now that we know C = 20, we can find Ch by substituting C into the equation Ch = 2C, which gives us Ch = 2(20) = 40.

The number of legs on a cow is 4, and the number of legs on a chicken is 2. So, the total number of legs on the cows is 4C = 4(20) = 80, and the total number of legs on the chickens is 2Ch = 2(40) = 80.

The total number of legs on all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

"To find out how many balls Josh is juggling at the talent show, we need to determine how many balls he had before the incident and then subtract the balls that were lost.

Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. So, the total number of balls he has after 4 weeks is 3 + 4 = 7.

However, Josh drops 3 balls, but 2 of them are caught by the crowd. So, he loses 1 ball.

Therefore, Josh starts juggling with 7 - 1 = 6 balls."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:

Weight of the pink frog = 50 pounds
Weight of the blue beetle = 50 pounds
Weight of the green toad = 50 pounds
Weight of the yellow snake = 60 pounds
Weight of the red bird = 30 pounds
Weight of the container = 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

1. Andrea started with $36.
2. She spent $11 on a sweater, so she had $36 - $11 = $25 left.
3. She then gave her brother $4, so she had $25 - $4 = $21 left.

Since $21 is the amount of money Andrea had after spending and giving her brother money, this is the amount she had after saving. To find out how much she saved, we need to subtract this amount from the initial amount.

Initial amount: $36
Amount after saving: $21

So, the amount Andrea saved is $36 - $21 = $15.

"To find the total time John spent, we need to calculate the time spent boating, swimming, and watching shows. 

Time spent boating = 6 hours
Time spent swimming = 6 / 2 = 3 hours
Time spent watching shows = 3 * 2 = 6 hours

Total time spent on these activities = 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours

Since the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time, we can set up the equation: 
0.3x = 6, where x is the total time spent.

To find x, we divide both sides by 0.3: 
x = 6 / 0.3
x = 20

Now that we know the total time spent is 20 hours, we can find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time. 
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 20

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
Since there are 'x' friends, the total cost for mini-golf for her friends will be 1 * $5 = $5. 
The total cost for mini-golf for Morgan and her friends will be $5 + $5 = $10.

The cost of arcade tokens is $5.

The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 rides * $10 = $20. 
Since there are 'x' friends, the total cost for go-karts for her friends will be 2 * $10 * x = $20x. 
The total cost for go-karts for Morgan and her friends will be $20 + $20x.

The total cost for all activities is $10 + $5 + $20 + $20x = $35 + $20x.

Since Morgan has a budget of $90, we can set up the equation: $35 + $20x = $90.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract $35 from both sides of the equation: $20x = $55.

Now, divide both sides by $20: x = $55 / $20.

x = 2.75

Since we can't invite a fraction of a friend, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, let's find out how much change Billy has after buying the candy. 
   Billy starts with $10 and spends an unknown amount on candy. Let's call the amount of candy he buys 'x'. 
   The cost of the candy is $1.5x. 
   So, the change he has is $10 - $1.5x.

2. He then takes half of this change and spends it on gumballs. 
   Half of the change is ($10 - $1.5x)/2.

3. The cost of each gumball is $0.05, and he buys 40 gumballs. 
   The total cost of the gumballs is 40 * $0.05 = $2.

4. The amount he spent on gumballs is half of his change, so we can set up the equation:
   ($10 - $1.5x)/2 = $2

5. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
   $10 - $1.5x = $4

6. Now, we can isolate x by subtracting $10 from both sides:
   -$1.5x = -$6

7. Finally, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by -1.5:
   x = $6 / $1.5
   x = 4

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

We are given that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45.

We are also given that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, so we can write the equation: C = 2S - 5.

Substituting C = 45 into the equation, we get: 45 = 2S - 5.

To solve for S, we need to isolate S on one side of the equation. First, we add 5 to both sides: 45 + 5 = 2S - 5 + 5, which simplifies to 50 = 2S.

Next, we divide both sides by 2: 50 / 2 = 2S / 2, which simplifies to 25 = S.

   We can write the equation: S = 4 * 3 - 5
   S = 12 - 5
   S = 7
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   Let's denote the number of people kicked out for physical violence as V. 
   We can write the equation: V = 3 * S
   V = 3 * 7
   V = 21
4. If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, we can write the equation: 
   3 + S + V = 50
   3 + 7 + 21 = 50
   31 = 50
   However, this equation is incorrect as it doesn't account for the people kicked out for other reasons. Let's correct the equation: 
   3 + S + V + O = 50
   3 + 7 + 21 + O = 50
   31 + O = 50
   O = 50 - 31
   O = 19

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"Let's denote the number of points Erin had before as x. 

Since Erin now has 14 points and she has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8, we can set up the equation: 

14 = x + 3(8)

Expanding the equation, we get:

14 = x + 24

Subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation, we get:

-10 = x

So, Erin had -10 points before."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the pins, and the cords separately and then add them together.

1. Cost of picture frames: 
   The cost of each picture frame is $20. Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.
   The logo etching costs an additional 20% of the picture frame cost. 20% of $20 is 0.2 * $20 = $4. So, the total cost of each picture frame with the logo etching is $20 + $4 = $24.
   The total cost of the picture frames with the logo etching is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. Cost of pins:
   2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. The total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. Cost of cords:
   1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 1/4 * 44 = 11 seniors.
   Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12. The total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we add the costs together:
$1056 (picture frames) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"
"To find the total cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the materials cost first. 

The original price of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

Since making it DIY saves 20%, we can calculate the materials cost as follows:

Materials cost = Original price - (Original price * 20%)
Materials cost = $400 - (400 * 0.20)
Materials cost = $400 - $80
Materials cost = $320

So, the total cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold on each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday.

Total shoes sold on Sunday = 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 
14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total hours of dance practice per week, we need to add up the hours from each day.

"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her children. 

Mrs. Sherman started with a dozen rolls, which is 12 rolls. She fed 6 children, so she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left.

Then, she broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces. To find out how many pieces in total, we multiply the number of rolls left by 8: 6 * 8 = 48.

So, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

48"
"To find the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we need to first find the number of pupils who like blue and green, and then subtract that from the total number of pupils.

Half of the class likes blue, so the number of pupils who like blue is 40 / 2 = 20.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so the number of pupils who like green is (40 - 20) / 4 = 20 / 4 = 5.

The number of pupils who like yellow is the total number of pupils minus the number of pupils who like blue and green, which is 40 - 20 - 5 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples picked and got $56. Since she sells apples at $4 per piece, we can find the number of apples she picked on Monday by dividing the total amount she got by the price per apple:
   Number of apples on Monday = Total amount / Price per apple
   Number of apples on Monday = $56 / $4
   Number of apples on Monday = 14

2. On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

3. On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day (Tuesday). 
   Number of apples on Wednesday = 2 * Number of apples on Tuesday
   Number of apples on Wednesday = 2 * 12
   Number of apples on Wednesday = 24

4. To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we add the number of apples picked each day:
   Total apples = Number of apples on Monday + Number of apples on Tuesday + Number of apples on Wednesday
   Total apples = 14 + 12 + 24
   Total apples = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many socks Lindsay has washed, we need to calculate the total number of socks from the pairs and the loose socks. 

Since each pair of socks has 2 socks, washing 10 pairs of socks means Lindsay has washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks from the pairs. 

Adding the 15 loose socks, Lindsay has washed a total of 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks that need washing, to find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks that need washing: 50 - 35 = 15.

"To find the monthly payment, we can use the formula for monthly payments on a loan:

M = P [ i(1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n - 1]

Where:
M = monthly payment
P = principal amount (initial loan amount) = $3,650
i = monthly interest rate = 10%/year / 12 months/year = 0.008333 (or 10%/12)
n = number of payments = 5 months

Plugging in the values, we get:

M = 3650 [ 0.008333(1 + 0.008333)^5 ] / [ (1 + 0.008333)^5 - 1]
M ≈ 3650 [ 0.008333(1.04319) ] / [ 1.04319 - 1]
M ≈ 3650 [ 0.008733 ] / 0.04319
M ≈ 3650 * 0.202
M ≈ 738.65

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. 

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 
Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

"To find the total profit per hour, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she bought enough supplies to make 3 pitchers, she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue will be 36 * $1 = $36.

Now, let's find the total cost. She spent $18 to buy the supplies.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we need to find the profit per hour. To do this, we divide the total profit by the number of cups she sells per hour: $18 / 4 = $4.50.

The final answer is: $4.50"
"Let's denote the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had as 'x'. Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his land, which is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation: (2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2 to isolate x:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of girls in the choir, we need to calculate 50% of 52. 
50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26 girls.

Since half the people performing can't make it to the show, we need to find half of the number of girls. 
Half of 26 = 26 / 2 = 13 girls can't make it.

The number of girls who can make it is 26 - 13 = 13 girls.

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. 
Total number of people who sang in the performance = 13 girls + 3 teachers = 16.

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu.

First, let's find the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and the number of messages to Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to find out how many popsicles each of them has. 

Let's assume the common ratio is x. So, Betty has 5x and Sam has 6x. 

The total number of popsicles they have together is 5x + 6x = 11x. We are given that the total number of popsicles is 165. 

So, 11x = 165. 

To find x, we divide both sides by 11: x = 165 / 11 = 15.

Now that we know x, we can find out how many popsicles each of them has. Betty has 5x = 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles. Sam has 6x = 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

"To find the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. 

The normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $10 + $10 = $20. 

Since Tim saves 20% by bundling, we need to find 20% of $20. 
20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4.

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

To find the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: 
$60 (cable package) - $26 (streaming services) = $34.

"To find the total work time, we need to convert all the times to the same unit. Let's convert 4 hours to minutes (4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes) and 90 minutes to hours (90 minutes / 60 = 1.5 hours).

Now, we know that Carol spends 4 hours (240 minutes) writing, half that time recording (240 minutes / 2 = 120 minutes), and 1.5 hours (90 minutes) editing.

Total work time = 240 minutes (writing) + 120 minutes (recording) + 90 minutes (editing) = 450 minutes

To convert total work time to hours, we divide by 60: 450 minutes / 60 = 7.5 hours.

Now, we need to find the percentage of time spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, and the total time is 7.5 hours.

Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100 = 20%

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we can find 1/3 of 12 by multiplying 12 by 1/3. 

12 * (1/3) = 12 * 1 / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4 slices to Bill.

Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. We can find 1/4 of 12 by multiplying 12 by 1/4.

12 * (1/4) = 12 * 1 / 4 = 12 / 4 = 3 slices to Mark.

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so the total slices eaten is 7 (given away) + 2 (eaten by Jenny) = 9 slices.

"To find out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, he needs 4 times the amount of each ingredient.

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs to buy:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs to buy:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before his jog. 

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, before his jog, Elliott completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. 

10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps completed before jog) = 4,000 steps left to complete

However, since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the steps he had left to complete before his jog.

4,000 (steps left to complete) - 2,000 (steps left after jog) = 2,000 steps

The final answer is: 2000"
"To find out how many minutes it will take Toby to read the book, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book and then divide it by his reading rate.

Total words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Time taken to read the book = Total words / reading rate = 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Since it takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, Toby will arrive at the airport 30 minutes after he starts reading. 

Time taken to get to the airport = Time taken to read the book + Time taken to travel to the airport = 30 minutes + 10 minutes = 40 minutes

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, so we need to find out how many minutes early he will be.

Minutes early = Total time available - Time taken to get to the airport = 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. 

The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees left is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400.

The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

The final answer is: $168,000"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds and the sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off,"" we can break it down as follows:

- 1 pound at $3
- 1/2 pound at 1/2 off, so the price is $3 - ($3 * 1/2) = $1.50
- Total cost of taffy = $3 + $1.50 = $4.50

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets:
- 4 magnets at $0.25 each = 4 * $0.25 = $1

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashells: $1.50
- Magnets: $1
- Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount:
- Money left = $10 - $7 = $3

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework separately and then add them together.

The first package of fireworks costs $400. The second package costs twice that much, so it is 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

He gets a 20% discount on the fireworks. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost of the fireworks by 0.20 (which is the decimal form of 20%): $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discount amount is subtracted from the total cost of the fireworks: $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150.

The total amount spent is the sum of the discounted fireworks and the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To find out how many cookies Shannon needs, we need to multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of days she wants the cookies to last. 

She eats 2 cookies per night, and she wants them to last 30 days. 

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies needed by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make.

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen cookies

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of a candle both smelling like wet dog and exploding. 

First, let's find the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog. This is given as 5% or 0.05. 

Next, we need to find the probability of a candle not exploding. Since the probability of a candle exploding is 1% or 0.01, the probability of a candle not exploding is 1 - 0.01 = 0.99.

However, we are given that 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of the candles will explode. This is consistent with our previous calculation.

Now, we need to find the probability of a candle both smelling like wet dog and not exploding. This is the product of the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog and the probability of a candle not exploding: 0.05 * 0.99 = 0.0495.

To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog and exploding, which is the product of the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog and the probability of a candle exploding: 0.05 * 0.01 = 0.0005.

Now, we can multiply this probability by the total number of candles to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode: 0.0005 * 50000 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount is 30% of the regular price, which is $20. To find 30% of $20, we multiply $20 by 0.30 (since 30% = 30/100 = 0.30). 

$20 * 0.30 = $6

So, the discount on each blouse is $6. To find the price of each blouse after the discount, we subtract the discount from the regular price:

$20 - $6 = $14

Now, we know that Misha picks out 4 blouses, and each blouse costs $14 after the discount. To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we multiply the price of each blouse by the number of blouses:

$14 * 4 = $56

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees as x.

Since Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees and her sister gathered twice as many, her sister gathered 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

Joanne gathered half the amount from the shortest trees as she did from the tallest trees, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples. Her sister gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so her sister gathered 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 30 + 15 + 60 + 45 = 150.

Since the sisters gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 150 = 350.

The number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is x, and the number of apples her sister gathered from the average trees is 0 (since she didn't take any). The total number of apples gathered from the average trees is 350, so x + 0 = 350.

x = 350"
"Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The total number of heads is 180, which means C + D = 180.
2. The total number of bumps is 304, which means 2C + D = 304 (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump).

We can solve this system of linear equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting C into the first equation:

D = 180 - C
D = 180 - 124
D = 56

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each part of the trip and add them together.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

In the next 2 days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 
30% of 800 km = 0.3 * 800 = 240 km
So, the total distance traveled in the next 2 days is 240 km.

In the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each part of the trip:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from Peter's locker size. 

Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can find Zack's locker size by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.

Zack's locker size = 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can find Timothy's locker size by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 20 * 2 = 40 cubic inches

"To find the elevation where Stanley's comb is, we need to subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's original elevation. 

Stanley's original elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's elevation to determine how many feet Oliver must climb.

Elevation of the comb: 6,000 feet
Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the steps:

1. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats carried away is 4 x 5 = 20.
3. Now, we subtract the number of cats carried away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30.
4. 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5: (3/5) * 30 = (3 * 30) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.
5. Now, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different pricing periods and calculate the cost for each period.

1. The first 6 months were $8 a month, so the cost for this period is:
6 months * $8/month = $48

2. The next 8 months were $12 a month, so the cost for this period is:
8 months * $12/month = $96

3. The remaining months (24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months) were $14 a month, so the cost for this period is:
10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, let's add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

The total cost for 2 years of the service is: $284"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. 
   Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J. 
   We can write the equation: J = T - 6.

2. The total savings is $6. 
   Since Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 2/3 from the tattered jeans. 
   We can write the equation: (1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6.

3. Substitute J from the first equation into the second equation: 
   (1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6.

4. Multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 
   T - 6 + 2T = 18.

5. Combine like terms: 
   3T - 6 = 18.

6. Add 6 to both sides of the equation: 
   3T = 24.

7. Divide both sides of the equation by 3: 
   T = 8.

8. Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans, we can find the cost of the jogger jeans: 
   J = T - 6 = 8 - 6 = 2.

9. The question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans: 
   J - T = 2 - 8 = -6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{-6}$"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, so she has a total of 3 + 3 = 6 bird feeders.

Each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds. Since Lillian has 3 store-bought bird feeders, they attract a total of 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Lillian has 3 bird feeders she made herself, so they attract a total of 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we add the number of birds attracted by the store-bought bird feeders and the number of birds attracted by the bird feeders Lillian made herself: 60 + 90 = 150.

The bagel costs $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. 
25% of $4 is 0.25 * 4 = $1. 
So, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5. 
The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is $4 / 2 = $2.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Kenny has $50 in spending cash and needs $100 to go to the amusement park, so he needs to make $50 from selling his cards.
2. He plans to sell each card for $1.5, so the number of cards he needs to sell to make $50 is:
   $50 / $1.5 = 33.33 (round down to 33, since he can't sell a fraction of a card)
3. Since Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, the number of cards he sells is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with.
4. Let's call the total number of cards he started with ""x"". Then, 2/3 of x is equal to 33:
   (2/3)x = 33
5. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:
   x = 33 * (3/2)
   x = 49.5
6. Since Kenny can't have a fraction of a card, we round up to the nearest whole number, but in this case, we can keep it as a decimal because we are looking for the number of cards he started with, and he can have a fraction of a card in his collection.

The final answer is: 49.5"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many guests were expected to have two hotdogs. Since half of the 36 guests were expected to have two hotdogs, we can calculate this as follows:

36 / 2 = 18

So, 18 guests were expected to have two hotdogs. This means that the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs in total.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that 40 guests in total had two hotdogs. Since the caterer only prepared 36 hotdogs, this means that 4 hotdogs were not enough for the extra 4 guests.

Since each guest who got a second hotdog had 2 hotdogs, the 4 extra guests who didn't get a second hotdog must be the 4 guests who were originally expected to have only one hotdog.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 4.

The cost of 3 bags of chips is 3 * 40 cents = $1.20. 

Since he spent 99% of his money, the amount he spent on chips and candy bars is 99% of $5, which is 0.99 * 5 = $4.95.

The total amount spent on candy bars is the difference between the total amount spent and the amount spent on chips: $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, the number of candy bars he bought is $3.75 / 0.75 = 5.

"To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to determine how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then add 5 minutes to that time.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne's arrival time. Since Wayne arrives in 4 minutes, Bernadette needs to leave 4 - 5 = -1 minute before Wayne's arrival time. However, since you can't leave a negative amount of time before, we need to calculate Bernadette's arrival time. 

Bernadette's arrival time is 16 minutes (her drive time) + 5 minutes (the time she needs to arrive before Wayne) = 21 minutes. 

Since Bernadette needs to arrive 21 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave 21 minutes before Wayne's arrival time. Wayne arrives in 4 minutes, so Bernadette needs to leave 4 - 21 = -17 minutes before Wayne's arrival time. However, since you can't leave a negative amount of time before, we need to calculate Bernadette's departure time. 

Bernadette's departure time is 21 minutes (the time she needs to arrive before Wayne) - 16 minutes (her drive time) = 5 minutes.

So Bernadette needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne to get to the theater first.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. Since the area of the room is given as 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length to feet. 

1 yard = 3 feet
So, 3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:
Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width
width = 360 / 9
width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula:
Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven:

Temperature increase per hour = 5 degrees
Number of hours the oven is on = 3 hours
Total temperature increase = 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window:

Temperature decrease per 10 minutes = 2 degrees
Time the window is open = 30 minutes
First, we need to convert 30 minutes to hours: 30 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 0.5 hours
Since the temperature decrease is per 10 minutes, we need to convert 0.5 hours to minutes: 0.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 30 minutes
Now, we can find the number of 10-minute intervals: 30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3 intervals
Total temperature decrease = 2 degrees/interval * 3 intervals = 6 degrees

Now, let's find the final temperature:

Initial temperature = 40 degrees
Temperature increase = 15 degrees
Temperature decrease = 6 degrees
Final temperature = Initial temperature + Temperature increase - Temperature decrease

- Bike: 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's find James' time for the swim. James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. 
10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. 
So, James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

James' bike time is 5 minutes longer than Jon's, so it is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, we can find James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time: 
180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

The final answer is: 59"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then divide it by 4.

Movie C is 1.25 hours. We need to convert this to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so:

Movie B = Movie C + 5 minutes
Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes
Movie B = 80 minutes

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so:

Movie A = Movie B / 4
Movie A = 80 minutes / 4
Movie A = 20 minutes

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount of hay the horse eats, we need to find the distance it runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, we need to convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time = 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money: $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to calculate the number of eggs in the cases and add the loose eggs. 

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 4 dozen eggs will be 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. 

Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs in total.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, so the total number of glasses Rozanne can make is 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, the total number of trays Rozanne can put out is 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's find the revenue from the flash sale on Monday:
17 sneakers were sold for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 * $20 = $340

Next, let's find the revenue from the sale to the department store:
There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.
These were sold for $25 each, so the revenue from the department store sale is:
31 * $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store sale:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The initial cost of the case of sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra.
2. The regular ticket costs $12.
3. The soda costs $3.
4. You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of the popcorn and soda with the regular ticket must be $2 more than the super ticket. 

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and the extra cost for popcorn and soda is $1. So, the total cost of the popcorn and soda with the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of the popcorn and soda with the regular ticket is $21 + $2 = $23.

The cost of the regular ticket is $12, and the cost of the soda is $3. So, the cost of the popcorn is $23 - $12 - $3 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is:

New cost = Original cost + Increase
New cost = 45 + 20
New cost = 65

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new rate:

Cost of filling 170 balloons = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
Cost of filling 170 balloons = 65 * 170
Cost of filling 170 balloons = 11050

The final answer is: 11050"
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed * Time
For the first part of the trip: Distance1 = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles

Total distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average speed = 50 mph

"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so the total number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost will be 160 * 12 = $1920.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

After 20 minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means 50 / 2 = 25 fairies joined the group.

So, the total number of fairies now is 50 (initial fairies) + 25 (new fairies) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. 

The number of fairies remaining is 75 - 30 = 45.

- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:
2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds

Since the truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
3400 / 2250 = 1.511 (round up to 2, since you can't make a fraction of a trip)

The farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."

Number of cookies = (1/2)x + 2

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

Pomeranians = (2/3) * 27
Pomeranians = 18

Now, we need to find the number of girl Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can calculate this as follows:

Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * 18
Girl Pomeranians = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the average highest temperature, we need to add the temperatures of the three countries and divide by 3.

The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48 degrees Fahrenheit.
The highest temperature in Northlandia is 21 degrees Fahrenheit.
The highest temperature in Midlandia is -3 degrees Fahrenheit.

First, let's add the temperatures:
-48 + 21 = -27
-27 + (-3) = -30

Now, let's divide the sum by 3:
-30 / 3 = -10

The average highest temperature of the three countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit.

The final answer is: -10"
"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to save. 

The toy car costs $12, and he already has $4. So, the remaining amount he needs to save is $12 - $4 = $8.

He promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take to save $8, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings:

$8 / $2 = 4

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to calculate the total number of eggs that can fit on the 2 trays and subtract that from the total number of eggs he has.

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays, so the total number of eggs that can fit on the trays is:
24 eggs/tray * 2 trays = 48 eggs

Jaime has 64 eggs, and 48 eggs can fit on the trays, so the number of eggs that won't fit is:
64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

"To find the total amount Sally spent, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

Cost of small pizza: $8
Cost of family-size pizza: $8 * 3 = $24

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent.

Total amount spent: $8 + $24 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the buy one get one free offer, and then apply the $2.00 coupon.

Since the buy one get one free offer means that Heather will get 8 razors for the price of 4, the cost of 2 packs of razors will be the cost of 1 pack, which is $4.00. 

So, the total cost of 2 packs of razors is $4.00.

Now, we apply the $2.00 coupon to the total cost. 

$4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00

Since Heather will get 8 razors for $2.00, we need to divide the total cost by 8 to find the cost of each individual razor.

$2.00 / 8 = $0.25

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.

$0.25 * 100 = 25 cents

"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them up.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall, so their total height is 4 * 64 = 256"".

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall, so their total height is 3 * 64 = 192"".

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128"".

The shortest girl is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 636"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 636"" / 12 = 53 feet.

The final answer is: 53"
"To find the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she walked in a day and then multiply it by the number of days she worked.

Charisma walks 5 minutes every hour. Since she works 8 hours a day, the total number of minutes she walks in a day is 5 * 8 = 40 minutes.

She worked for 5 days, so the total number of minutes she walked is 40 * 5 = 200 minutes.

"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is 6 dollars per ride, and he drove twice a day for 14 days. So, the total cost of the morning rides is:
6 * 2 * 14 = 168 dollars

The cost of the afternoon rides is 2 dollars per ride, and he also drove twice a day for 14 days. So, the total cost of the afternoon rides is:
2 * 2 * 14 = 56 dollars

Now, we add the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides to find the total amount of money Paul spent:
168 + 56 = 224 dollars

"To find out how many pies they can make, we need to calculate the total number of oranges they have and then divide that by 3 (since one pie needs 3 oranges).

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she has 5 x 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one pie needs 3 oranges, they can make 120 / 3 = 40 pies.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

For the first venue, the total cost is the flat fee of $200 plus the cost of food for each guest, which is $5x. So, the total cost for the first venue is 200 + 5x.

For the second venue, the total cost is the cost per guest, which is $25x.

To find the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we set the two expressions equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by Lily as L, David as D, and Bodhi as B.

We are given the following information:

1. L + D + B = 43 (total number of insects collected)
2. L = D + 7 (Lily found 7 more than David)
3. D = B/2 (David found half of what Bodhi found)

From equation (3), we can express D in terms of B: D = B/2.

Substituting D = B/2 into equation (2), we get:
L = B/2 + 7

Now, substitute L and D in terms of B into equation (1):
(B/2 + 7) + (B/2) + B = 43

Combine like terms:
(2B/2) + 7 + B = 43
B + 7 + B = 43
2B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2:
B = 18

Now that we know B, we can find D:
D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9

And finally, we can find L:
L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, she used (1/4) * 364 yards = 91 yards.

Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, she used (1/2) * 364 yards = 182 yards.

Now, let's add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together: 91 yards + 182 yards = 273 yards.

"To find the length of the couch, we need to first find the width of the rug. 

Given that the chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, the width of the rug is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. Adding 2 feet to this gives us the length of the couch: 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

- Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.
- 2 packs are strawberry gum.
- 1 pack is grape gum, which costs $2.
- 1 pack is green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum.
- The total cost is $7.

Since the green apple gum costs half as much as the grape gum, and the grape gum costs $2, the green apple gum costs $2 / 2 = $1.

Now, let's find the total cost of the grape and green apple gum: $2 (grape) + $1 (green apple) = $3.

Since Suzie bought 4 packs in total, and 3 packs are not strawberry, the remaining 1 pack must be strawberry. The total cost of the strawberry gum is the total cost minus the cost of the other 3 packs: $7 - $3 = $4.

Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack is $4 / 2 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar spent. 

Let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

For a 2 x 4, Frederick gets 200 sticks for $4, so the cost per stick is $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick.
For a 2 x 8, Frederick gets 400 sticks for $6, so the cost per stick is $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick.

Since a 2 x 8 gives him more sticks per dollar, we should prioritize buying 2 x 8s. 

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8s Frederick can buy with his $24:

$24 / $6 = 4

Since he can buy 4 2 x 8s, he will get 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks from the 2 x 8s.

The remaining money is $24 - $24 = $0, so he cannot buy any 2 x 4s.

The total number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make is 1600."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total number of snowshoes needed and then multiply it by the cost per pair.

Each dog has 4 legs, and Mario has 6 dogs. So, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes needed is 24 / 2 = 12 (because each pair has 2 snowshoes).

The cost per pair of snowshoes is $12.00. 

Now, we multiply the total number of snowshoes needed by the cost per pair: 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"

"Let's break down the information given:

- The farm has 30 cows.
- The zoo has 20 sheep.
- The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
- The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Total number of animals: 40 (farm) + 80 (zoo) = 120

"Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'. 

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can write the equation as:
x + y = 4(x + y)

Given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, we can write the equation as:
x + y = 12 and x + y = 4

However, the second equation is incorrect as it is the same as the first one. We can assume that the second equation should be the total number of items Rose bought, which is 16 (12 onions + 4 potatoes). So, the correct equation is:
x + y = 16

Since we have two variables and one equation, we need more information to solve for x and y. However, we can use the fact that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. This can be written as:
x + y = 4(x + y)

Simplifying the equation, we get:
x + y = 4x + 4y

Subtracting x from both sides, we get:
y = 3x + 4y

Subtracting 4y from both sides, we get:
-3y = 3x

Dividing both sides by -3, we get:
y = -x

Substituting y = -x into the equation x + y = 16, we get:
x + (-x) = 16

Simplifying the equation, we get:
0 = 16

This is a contradiction, which means that the initial assumption that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is incorrect. However, we can try to find the ratio of the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought.

Let's assume that Sophia bought x onions and y potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can write the ratio as:
x : y = 1 : 4

Since Rose bought 12 onions, we can write the equation as:
x = 12/4
x = 3

Substituting x = 3 into the ratio, we get:
3 : y = 1 : 4

Simplifying the ratio, we get:
y = 12

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 12 potatoes.

"To find the number of days Andy has to lose the weight, we need to calculate the difference between his birthday and today's date. 

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to January 1st is 1 day. 
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. 
February has 28 days (since it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. 
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. 
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days. 
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days. 
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days. 
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total days = 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 171 days

Since Andy needs to lose 30 pounds and it takes 3500 calories to lose a pound, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 
105,000 calories / 171 days = approximately 613.5 calories per day.

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we can find the cost of the house by multiplying x by 3:

Cost of the house = 3x = 3(30,000) = 90,000

"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the canvas bags, which is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack * $4 per bag = 8 * 5 * 4 = $160.

The total revenue is the selling price of the bags, which is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $64 - $160 = -$96.

However, since profit cannot be negative, it seems there is an error in the problem. The selling price of $8 per bag is lower than the cost price of $4 per bag, which is not possible. 

Assuming the selling price is higher than the cost price, let's recalculate the profit with a higher selling price. 

If the selling price is $12 per bag, the total revenue would be 8 bags * $12 per bag = 8 * 12 = $96.

The profit would be $96 - $160 = -$64. However, this is still not possible.

If the selling price is $16 per bag, the total revenue would be 8 bags * $16 per bag = 8 * 16 = $128.

The profit would be $128 - $160 = -$32. However, this is still not possible.

If the selling price is $20 per bag, the total revenue would be 8 bags * $20 per bag = 8 * 20 = $160.

The profit would be $160 - $160 = $0.

If the selling price is $24 per bag, the total revenue would be 8 bags * $24 per bag = 8 * 24 = $192.

The profit would be $192 - $160 = $32.

Since the selling price of $24 per bag is higher than the cost price of $4 per bag, this is a possible scenario.

The final answer is: $32"

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins by the amount of raisins needed for each batch of cookies.

First, let's find out how many cups of raisins will be used for each of the three items (oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix). Since Heather divides the bag of raisins equally among the three items, each item will get 1/3 of the total raisins.

Total raisins = 27 cups
Raisins for each item = 27 / 3 = 9 cups

Now, we know that each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the raisins for each item (9 cups) by the amount of raisins needed for each batch of cookies (3/4 cup).

Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, 5 people can paint half a house in 5 / 5 = 1 day. 

Since 5 people can paint half a house in 1 day, they can paint a whole house in 2 days (because 2 * 0.5 = 1).

Now, we need to convert the time from days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 2 days is equal to 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has x chairs, where x - 2 = 20 (sofas).
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3x chairs.

From the first point, we know Ophelia has 20 sofas. From the second point, we can find the number of chairs Ophelia has: x - 2 = 20, x = 22.

Now we know Ophelia has 22 chairs and 20 sofas. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of sofas and chairs Ophelia has to the number of chairs Jenna has: 20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 108.

The final answer is: 108"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say the number of CDs Tom bought is x and the number of headphones he bought is y. We know that the total cost of the items is $48, and the cost of a CD is $4. We also know that Tom bought a CD for $4, so we can set up the equation:

4x + 4y = 48

Since Tom bought a CD for $4, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 4:

x + y = 12

We are asked to find how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he had decided not to buy the headphone set. This means we need to find the value of x when y = 0.

x + 0 = 12
x = 12

So, Tom would have been able to buy 12 CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

However, we need to find out how many more CDs he would have been able to buy, not the total number of CDs. Since we know that Tom originally bought 1 CD, we can subtract 1 from the total number of CDs he would have been able to buy:

12 - 1 = 11

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours spent in the weeks where he worked out 4 hours, the weeks where he worked out 5 hours, and the week where he worked out 6 hours.

Let's start by calculating the total hours spent in the weeks where he worked out 4 hours. Since there are 8 weeks in total, and he worked out 4 hours in 6 of those weeks, the total hours spent in those weeks is 6 * 4 = 24 hours.

Next, we need to calculate the total hours spent in the weeks where he worked out 5 hours. He worked out 5 hours for 2 consecutive weeks, so the total hours spent in those weeks is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

Finally, we need to add the hours spent in the week where he worked out 6 hours, which is 6 hours.

Now, we can add up the total hours spent in all the weeks: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the number of passengers after the second stop, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus, so 5 * 8 = 40 people get in. 
Now, the total number of passengers is:
40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 3 times 21 is 63, but since it's 3 times fewer, we subtract 63 from 21 to get the number of passengers who got in, which is 21 - 63 = -42. However, since you can't have a negative number of passengers, this means that 63 is the number of passengers who got in. 
Now, the total number of passengers is:
59 (left) + 63 (got in) = 122

The final answer is: 122"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5 + 8) = x + 13 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 13 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation:

x + 13 = 2x + 10 - 5
x + 13 = 2x + 5
13 - 5 = 2x - x
8 = x

Now that we know Jame's current age, we can find his age in 5 years:

Jame's age in 5 years = x + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13

We also know that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 13 = 8 + 13 = 21 years old.

To find the difference in their ages now, we subtract Jame's current age from his cousin's current age. However, we don't know Jame's cousin's current age. We can find it by subtracting 8 from 21 (Jame's cousin's age in 8 years) to get 13. 

Jame's cousin's current age = 13 - 8 = 5

Now we can find the difference in their ages:

Difference in their ages = Jame's cousin's current age - Jame's current age = 5 - 8 = -3

However, since age cannot be negative, we need to find the absolute difference. The absolute difference in their ages is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
2. The cost of the computer is $1,100.
3. The cost of the printer is $400 less than the computer.

First, let's find the cost of the printer. Since the cost of the printer is $400 less than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer:

Cost of printer = Cost of computer - $400
= $1,100 - $400
= $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400. We can subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from this total to find the cost of the 2 monitors:

Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - (Cost of computer + Cost of printer)
= $2,400 - ($1,100 + $700)
= $2,400 - $1,800
= $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we need to divide the cost of the 2 monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor:

Cost of one monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
= $600 / 2
= $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many shells the boys brought in total. Since there are 10 boys (half of 20 kids), and each boy brought 60 shells, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 60 shells. 

First, we calculate 4 * 60 = 240. Then, we add 600 + 240 = 840.

Since there are 10 girls (half of 20 kids), we need to find out how many shells each girl brought. To do this, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by the number of girls: 840 / 10 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say George had x candies initially. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2x candies initially.

George ate 5 candies, so he has x - 5 candies left.

We are given that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation:

x - 5 = 3

To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 3 + 5
x = 8

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find out how many candies Nick had initially:

Nick had 2x candies initially, so Nick had 2(8) = 16 candies initially.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Anne's age, we need to first find Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6 years.

Then, to find Anne's age, we add 2 years to Alyana's age. So, Anne's age is 6 + 2 = 8 years.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188

"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the total number of vlogs she has already made from the target number of vlogs.

Emma made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

Total vlogs made = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Now, subtract the total vlogs made from the target number of vlogs (72) to find out how many more vlogs Emma needs to make.

Vlogs needed = 72 - 54 = 18

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let x be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of the month. 

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, he will save 2x each day in the second half.

The total number of days in April is 30. 

The total amount Elvis saves in the first half of the month is 15x (15 days). 

The total amount Elvis saves in the second half of the month is 15 * 2x = 30x.

The total amount Elvis saves in the month is 15x + 30x = 45x.

We know that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. 

So, we can set up the equation: 45x = 1125.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 45: x = 1125 / 45 = 25.

Now that we know x, we can find the amount Elvis saves each day in the second half of the month, which is 2x = 2 * 25 = 50.

Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, and Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks, we can find the number of cups Octavia drinks by dividing the daily recommended amount by 2. However, the daily recommended amount is not specified in the problem. 

Let's assume the daily recommended amount is 'x'. Then, Octavia drinks x/2 cups of coffee. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks, Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups of coffee.

We are given that Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan needs to reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the recommended amount from the amount he currently drinks: 5x - 4.

However, we still need to find the value of 'x'. Since we are not given the daily recommended amount, we can assume it to be a variable. But to solve the problem, we need a specific value for 'x'. 

Let's assume the daily recommended amount is 8 cups. Then, Octavia drinks 8/2 = 4 cups of coffee. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks, Juan drinks 10 * 4 = 40 cups of coffee.

"Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M, the number of goals scored by Anna as A, and the number of goals scored by Richie as R.

We are given that R = 80, R = M + 20, and R = A + 45.

From the first two equations, we can write M = R - 20. Substituting R = 80 into this equation, we get M = 80 - 20 = 60.

From the first and third equations, we can write A = R - 45. Substituting R = 80 into this equation, we get A = 80 - 45 = 35.

Now that we have the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can find the total number of goals scored by adding M, A, and R: M + A + R = 60 + 35 + 80 = 175.

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we need to first find out how much money Mitchell made and then subtract the amount Liam made from it.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so we multiply 21 by 4 to find out how much he made: 
21 * 4 = 84

Now, we subtract the amount Liam made ($63) from the amount Mitchell made ($84):
84 - 63 = 21

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of action figures he bought each day and add them up.

From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day on wooden action figures. Since he spent 4 days, he spent a total of 4 * $5 = $20 on wooden action figures.

He has $70 initially and spent $20 on wooden action figures, so he has $70 - $20 = $50 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), Peter will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. Since he has $50 left and there are 3 days remaining, he can spend a maximum of $50 / $2 = 25 action figures.

However, we need to consider that he has $50 left, so he can't buy 25 action figures. He can only buy 25 action figures if he had $50, but since he has $50, he can buy 25 action figures. 

So, Peter bought 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures. The total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is 4 + 25 = 29.

The final answer is: 29"
"To find the total cost, we need to add up the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200.
The cost of the vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60.
The cost of the broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The final answer is: $308"
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to first calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 - 160 = 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the remaining amount in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount removed from the account and subtract it from the initial amount.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 * 12 = 24 months.

The amount removed each month is $100, so the total amount removed in 24 months is 24 * $100 = $2400.

The initial amount in the account is $3000. 

Now, subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

Total cost per 10 sandwiches:
- Bread cost: $3.00 per loaf * 1 loaf (since 1 loaf makes 10 sandwiches) = $3.00
- Cheese and condiments cost: $30.00 per 10 sandwiches
- Total cost per 10 sandwiches: $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

Total revenue per 10 sandwiches:
- Selling price per sandwich: $7.00
- Total revenue per 10 sandwiches: $7.00 * 10 = $70.00

Since the problem asks for the net profit, we need to find the profit per 10 sandwiches first:
- Profit per 10 sandwiches: Total revenue per 10 sandwiches - Total cost per 10 sandwiches = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

To find the net profit per sandwich, we divide the profit per 10 sandwiches by 10:
- Net profit per sandwich: $37.00 / 10 = $3.70

However, the question asks for the net profit, which is the profit per 10 sandwiches. Therefore, the net profit is $37.00.

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to first find out how many muffin crayons she can make. 

Since Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, she has a total of 3 * 64 = 192 crayons.

She melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin crayon. To find out how many muffin crayons she can make, we need to divide the total number of crayons by 8.

192 / 8 = 24

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom and the costs for each component.

The area of the bedroom is length * width = 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost for the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost for the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost to remove the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost to remove the old carpet is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost to install the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost to install the new carpet is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost to replace the carpet is the sum of the costs for the carpet, padding, removal, and installation: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11332.

The final answer is: $11332"

1. The starting value of the number train is 20.
2. Half of the starting value is 20 / 2 = 10.
3. The starting value plus half the number is 20 + 10 = 30.
4. The resulting value is divided by 5, so 30 / 5 = 6.
5. The resulting value is multiplied by the starting value minus 12, so 6 * (20 - 12) = 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To find the total number of cards the brother has, we need to subtract 3 from the number of cards the boy has. 

The boy has 5 cards. 
The brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, to find the total number of cards they have together, we need to add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards the brother has.

Total cards = 5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7

"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to find the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference is 468 - 450 = 18.
The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4%, to find the actual temperature, we need to add 4% of the set temperature to the set temperature.

The actual temperature for 520 degrees is 520 + (520 * 0.04) = 520 + 20.8 = 540.8.

Since the oven is off by the same percentage, to find the temperature Maggie should set it at, we need to subtract 4% of the desired temperature from the actual temperature.

The temperature Maggie should set it at is 540.8 - 20.8 = 520.

However, since the oven is off by 4% in both directions, we need to adjust the temperature in the opposite direction. 

The temperature Maggie should set it at is 520 - (520 * 0.04) = 520 - 20.8 = 499.2.

The final answer is: 499.2"
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 1 hour to 60 minutes. Adding 30 minutes to that gives us 60 + 30 = 90 minutes for the first movie.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours to minutes gives us 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. Adding 5 minutes to that gives us 120 + 5 = 125 minutes for the second movie.

Now, we add the time for both movies together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

The final answer is: 215"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price.

Herb's house price = $76,000
30% of Herb's house price = 0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800
Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
= $76,000 - $22,800
= $53,200

Now, we need to find the combined value of the two houses.
Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
= $76,000 + $53,200
= $129,200

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.
2. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.
3. Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 + 20 = 60 dishes.
4. To find the total number of cups, we add Judy's cups and her friend's cups: 12 + 40 = 52 cups.
5. To find the total number of dishes, we add Judy's dishes and her friend's dishes: 24 + 60 = 84 dishes.
6. To find the total number of utensils, we add the total number of cups and the total number of dishes: 52 + 84 = 136.

"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we need to first find the total number of pairs of contacts Pete will buy and the total cost of the boxes.

Since each box lasts 45 days and Pete buys 2 boxes, the total number of days the contacts will last is 2 * 45 = 90 days.

Since 90 single use contacts will last 90 days, the number of pairs of contacts Pete will buy is 90 / 2 = 45 pairs.

The discount on each box is 10% of $100, which is 0.1 * $100 = $10. So, the discounted price of each box is $100 - $10 = $90.

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is 2 * $90 = $180.

To find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs: $180 / 45 = $4.

"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate the total hours worked by each of them and then multiply it by the hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so the total hours worked by Jill is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so John worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. 
John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so John worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. 
The total hours worked by John is 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

The hourly wage is $10. 
Jill's total earnings = 3 hours * $10 = $30.
John's total earnings = 7 hours * $10 = $70.

The difference in earnings between John and Jill is $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find the total calories burned, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running separately and then add them together.

Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units there are.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by 100 ml.

8 * 100 ml = 800 ml

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans)
2. G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans)
3. B + R + G = 4500 (total number of jelly beans)

Substituting the first two equations into the third equation, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3.00B = 4500
Divide both sides by 3:
B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

R = 0.99B = 0.99(1500) = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01(1500) = 1515

To find the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

After the first increase, his speed is 52 WPM. 
To find the third measurement, we add 5 WPM to the second measurement: 
52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM.

Now, we have the three measurements: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM. 

To find the average, we add the three measurements and divide by 3:

2. Alex then calls 10 of her friends to invite them too. 
   So, the total number of people invited by Alex is 300 + 10 = 310.

3. 8 of the friends she called say they will be bringing their spouses. 
   So, the total number of spouses is 8.

Now, we add the total number of people invited by email, the friends she called, and the spouses to find the total number of people attending:

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown, and then subtract the deposit he has already paid.

The base price of each implant is $2000. Since he needs 2 implants, the total cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000.

He wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

He has already paid a deposit of $600. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since he makes $15 per hour at work, to find out how many hours he needs to work to pay for the dental work, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it can be represented as 2x. 
And since one angle is three times the smallest angle, it can be represented as 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

One angle is twice the smallest angle: 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
One angle is three times the smallest angle: 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

Total amount of money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball

"To find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to first find out how many pounds Ruiz makes in an hour. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how many pounds he makes in an hour, we divide 120 by 2. 

120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour for Ruiz.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour. To find out how many pounds Marissa makes in an hour, we multiply 60 by 3/4.

60 * (3/4) = 45 pounds per hour for Marissa.

Now, we know that Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour and Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour. They both work for 12 hours a day. 

To find the total amount of chocolates they make in a day, we add their hourly production and multiply it by 12.

Ruiz's total production = 60 * 12 = 720 pounds

Rotations per month = 400 miles/month * 725 rotations/mile = 290,000 rotations/month

Now, we need to find out how many months the tire can last. 

Total rotations = 10,440,000 rotations
Rotations per month = 290,000 rotations/month

Months the tire can last = Total rotations / Rotations per month = 10,440,000 / 290,000 = 36 months

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find out how many years the tire can last by dividing the number of months by 12.

Years the tire can last = 36 months / 12 months/year = 3 years

"To find the cost per pump, we need to first find the total cost of the shampoo in cents. 

The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, which is equal to 2400 cents (since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents).

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, to find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the number of washings per pump. 

Cost per pump = Total cost / Number of washings per pump
Cost per pump = 2400 cents / 60
Cost per pump = 40 cents

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total cost of the items before the discount, we need to add the price of the shirt and the shorts. 

Total cost before discount = $25 (shirt) + $35 (shorts) = $60

Since there is a 30% discount, we need to find 30% of $60 to calculate the discount amount.

Discount amount = 30% of $60 = 0.30 * $60 = $18

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost to get the final cost.

Final cost = Total cost before discount - Discount amount = $60 - $18 = $42

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to calculate it separately.

Joe started with $50, so to find out how much money he will have left after the purchase, we subtract the final cost from the initial amount.

Money left = Initial amount - Final cost = $50 - $42 = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the total number of pounds of butter needed, we need to calculate the total number of croissants and then multiply it by the amount of butter needed per croissant.

Since Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 12 croissants in a dozen, we can calculate the total number of croissants as follows:

4 dozen * 12 croissants/dozen = 48 croissants

Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we can calculate the amount of butter needed per croissant as follows:

1/4 pound / 12 croissants = 1/48 pound per croissant

Now, we can multiply the total number of croissants by the amount of butter needed per croissant to find the total amount of butter needed:

48 croissants * (1/48 pound/croissant) = 1 pound

Since Juan wants to make croissants for a week, which is 7 days, we need to multiply the total amount of butter needed per day by 7:

1 pound/day * 7 days = 7 pounds

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as 'x'. Since there are 10 total classes, the number of classes he will attend is 10 - x.

The total cost of the classes is $60. If he attends '10 - x' classes at $10 per class, the total cost of the classes he attends is 10(10 - x).

The cost of the classes he misses is x * $0 (since he doesn't pay for the classes he misses).

The total cost of the classes is the sum of the cost of the classes he attends and the cost of the classes he misses, which is equal to $60.

So, we can set up the equation: 10(10 - x) = 60

Expanding the equation, we get: 100 - 10x = 60

Subtracting 100 from both sides, we get: -10x = -40

Dividing both sides by -10, we get: x = 4

So, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

Discount: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Total cost = $600 - $60 = $540

Now, let's find the difference between the two costs:
Difference = $540 - $398 = $142

The final answer is: $142"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first month, the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Let's denote the total sales from green hats as G. Then, the sales from red hats can be represented as 0.5G = 400.

2. Solve for G: G = 400 / 0.5 = 800.

3. So, in the first month, the total sales were G + 400 = 800 + 400 = 1200.

4. In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. Let's denote the total sales of the second month as S2. Then, S2 = (3/4) * 1200 = 900.

5. The total amount she made in two months is the sum of the sales of the first and second months: Total = 1200 + 900 = 2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and the total cost of those hours.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. Each hour after that costs twice the cost of the first hour, which is 2 * $15 = $30.

So, the cost of the second hour is $30 and the cost of the third hour is $30.

The total cost is $15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $30 (third hour) = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find out how much was withheld from Sally's wage, we need to calculate the difference between her expected wage and the actual amount in her account. 

First, let's find out how much money Sally should have in her account if she received her full wage. 

Expected wage: $300
Initial amount in the account: $200
Expected total: $300 + $200 = $500

Since the actual amount in her account is $420, we can find the difference between the expected total and the actual amount to determine how much was withheld.

Withheld amount = Expected total - Actual amount
Withheld amount = $500 - $420
Withheld amount = $80

The final answer is: $80"
"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori's guests will eat, we multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves per guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many eggs are needed for 48 deviled egg halves. 

48 deviled egg halves / 2 deviled egg halves per egg = 24 eggs

To find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12).

24 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 2 dozens

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the plane, the cost of renting the hanger, and the cost of fuel for the first year.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The cost of renting the hanger per month is $5000. 
The cost of fuel per month is twice the cost of renting the hanger, which is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The total monthly cost is $5000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year).
$15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

The total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year is $150,000 (plane) + $180,000 (maintenance) = $330,000.

"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can set up the following equation based on the total number of legs:

4S + 2G = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, which means the sum of the number of sheep and geese is 20:

S + G = 20

We can solve the second equation for G:

G = 20 - S

Now, substitute G in the first equation:

4S + 2(20 - S) = 70

Expand the equation:

4S + 40 - 2S = 70

Combine like terms:

2S + 40 = 70

Subtract 40 from both sides:

2S = 30

Divide both sides by 2:

S = 15

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut.

The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound. The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 * 5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 pounds. The cost of the more expensive coffee is 7 * $6 = $42.

The cost of the donut is $2.

The total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:

Janey's books = 2x + 3

We are given that Janey has 21 books. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for 'x':

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To find the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 20 feet to inches by multiplying 20 by 12.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches per day and its current height is 240 inches. To find the number of days it will take to reach 600 inches, we can subtract the current height from the target height and divide by the growth rate.

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Now, divide the remaining height by the growth rate:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. 
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs 8 more toys. Now, he has 4 (initial toys) + 8 (new toys) = 12 toys for 12 dogs.
3. When James came back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs. So, James needs 16 more toys. Now, he has 12 (previous toys) + 16 (new toys) = 28 toys for 28 dogs.
4. When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. Now, he has 28 - 3 = 25 toys for 25 dogs.

However, the question asks for the total number of toys James needs. Since James has 25 toys, but he needs one toy for each dog, and there are 25 dogs, he still needs 25 toys."

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

Let's denote the cost of one candy as 'c'. We know that 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20. We also know that each lollipop costs $0.40. 

The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2. 

Now, we can set up an equation to find the cost of one candy: 
5 lollipops + 4c = $3.20
$2 + 4c = $3.20

Subtract $2 from both sides of the equation:
4c = $1.20

Divide both sides of the equation by 4:
c = $0.30

Now that we know the cost of one candy, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
10 lollipops = 10 * $0.40 = $4
10 candies = 10 * $0.30 = $3

The total cost is $4 + $3 = $7.

"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, we can express it as 0.6x. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check, so we can write the equation: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. Subtracting 0.6x from both sides gives us 0.4x = $40. 

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.4: x = $40 / 0.4 = $100.

Now that we know the total bill is $100, we can find out how much John leaves with. He brought $125, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares, so it is 18 + 6 = 24.
The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares, so it is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, we add the number of squares of each color together: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68.

The total number of squares is 68, and since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: 68"

"To find the total number of fireworks set off in the city, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of fireworks in each box. 

15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300.

40% of 300 = 0.4 * 300 = 120 fireworks

Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. 

3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to add the number of fireworks she can see from the city and the number of fireworks she sets off in her backyard.

"To find the total number of people, we need to add Aiden and his 12 friends and the 7 friends they meet at the cinema. 
Total people = Aiden + 12 friends + 7 friends = 19 people

Since each seat can hold 1 person, 2 drinks, and 3 snacks, we need to multiply the total number of people by 2 drinks and 3 snacks to find the total number of drinks and snacks.
Total drinks = 19 people * 2 drinks/person = 38 drinks
Total snacks = 19 people * 3 snacks/person = 57 snacks

Since each drink and snack costs $2, we multiply the total number of drinks and snacks by the cost per item to find the total cost.

"Let's denote the weight that Gissela's truck can carry as G, Gordy's truck as Gd, and Gary's truck as Gy. 

We know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel. 
Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gd = G + 800. 
The total weight that all three trucks can carry is 11,600 pounds, so G + Gd + Gy = 11,600.

Substituting Gd = G + 800 into the equation G + Gd + Gy = 11,600, we get G + (G + 800) + Gy = 11,600. 
Combine like terms to get 2G + Gy + 800 = 11,600. 
Subtract 800 from both sides to get 2G + Gy = 11,800. 
Now we have two equations: G = 4,000 and 2G + Gy = 11,800. 
Substitute G = 4,000 into 2G + Gy = 11,800 to get 2(4,000) + Gy = 11,800. 
Simplify to get 8,000 + Gy = 11,800. 
Subtract 8,000 from both sides to get Gy = 3,800.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3800}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. There are 8 males and 6 females, so the total number of people is 8 + 6 = 14.
2. Each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.
3. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.
4. The total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.
5. The total number of dumplings eaten by all people is 18 (by females) + 32 (by males) = 50.
6. Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten, which is 50.

"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to first find out how much they need to raise per hour. 

The amount raised in the first 3 hours is $2100. To find the amount raised per hour, we divide the total amount raised by the number of hours: 

$2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise the remaining amount. The total goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. 

Remaining amount = $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

To find the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour:

$4200 / $700 per hour = 6 hours.

Since they have already raised money for 3 hours, we need to add the additional hours to the initial 3 hours:

Total hours = 3 hours + 6 hours = 9 hours.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city, and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. 

80% of the water used by the city is used for industrial purposes, so the percentage used for non-industrial purposes is 100% - 80% = 20% of the water used by the city.

To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we multiply the percentage of the river's water used by the city (40%) by the percentage used for non-industrial purposes (20%):

40% * 20% = 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.08 * 100 = 8%

"To find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to find the rate at which the factory makes chocolate and vanilla ice cream per hour.

For chocolate ice cream, the factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours. 
So, the rate of chocolate ice cream per hour is 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours. 
So, the rate of vanilla ice cream per hour is 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours by multiplying the rate of each flavor by the number of hours and adding them together.

Total quarts of chocolate ice cream in 48 hours = 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Total quarts of vanilla ice cream in 48 hours = 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

2 friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, so each friend ate 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices. Since there are 2 friends, they ate 2 * 8 = 16 slices in total.

Bryce also ate 2/3 of his pizza, which is 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices.

So, the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and 2 friends is 16 + 8 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas, so each friend ate ¾ * 12 = 9 slices. Since there are 2 friends, they ate 2 * 9 = 18 slices in total.

The total number of slices eaten is 24 + 18 = 42 slices.

Since there were 5 friends and each ordered 1 pizza with 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60 slices.

"Let's denote the number of books Steven has as 'x'. 

Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven, Clara has 2x books. We are given that Clara has 20 books, so we can set up the equation 2x = 20.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 20 / 2 = 10.

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find the number of books Alice has. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, Alice has 10 + 6 = 16 books.

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has: 20 - 16 = 4.

The total cost is the cost of the packs plus the cost of the cards. 
3 packs for $1800 each is 3 x $1800 = $5400.
The cost of the 2 cards is $4000 + $1000 = $5000.
The cost of the 30 cards is 30 x $50 = $1500.
The total cost is $5400 + $5000 + $1500 = $11900.

The total revenue is the value of the 2 cards plus the value of the 30 cards.
The value of the 2 cards is $4000 + $1000 = $6000.
The value of the 30 cards is 30 x $50 = $1500.

Step 1: Calculate the number of small stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons.
Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them. 
90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.

Step 2: Calculate the number of large buttons Lorraine gets for the small stickers.
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, Lorraine gets 27 small buttons.

Step 3: Calculate the number of large buttons Lorraine gets for her large stickers.
Lorraine starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them. 
50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.

Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, Lorraine gets 20 large buttons.

Step 4: Calculate the number of small buttons Lorraine gets for the remaining large stickers.
Since Lorraine traded 20 large stickers for large buttons, she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
Each large sticker is worth three small stickers, so she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Since each small sticker is worth one small button, Lorraine gets 60 small buttons.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of buttons Lorraine has.
Lorraine has 27 small buttons from the small stickers, 20 large buttons from the large stickers, and 60 small buttons from the remaining large stickers.
Total buttons = 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons.

3. There are 6 Pomeranian girls.

From point 2, we know that 1/3 of the Pomeranians are girls, and we are given that this number is 6. To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To solve for Total Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now that we know there are 18 Pomeranians, we can use point 1 to find the total number of puppies. Since 2/3 of the puppies are Pomeranians, and we know there are 18 Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To solve for Total Puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

The cost of the older movies is:
160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are normal movies. We subtract the series and older movies from the total:
600 - 200 - 160 = 240 normal movies

The cost of the normal movies is:
240 * $10 = $2400

Now, we add the cost of the series movies, the older movies, and the normal movies to find the total cost:
$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

The final answer is: $4400"

"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to find the total distance they traveled by driving and hiking. 

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's find the distance they traveled by driving. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. The distance they traveled by driving is 6 * 50 = 300 miles.

Next, let's find the distance they traveled by hiking. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. The distance they traveled by hiking is 1.5 * 20 = 30 miles.

The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance they traveled by driving and hiking. The total distance is 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: 330"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Let's assume Emma jumps on x enemies, so Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies.
- Emma collects y berries, so Ava collects y + 3 berries.
- Emma finishes the level in z seconds, so Ava finishes the level in z + 4 seconds.

The score for each player can be calculated as follows:
- Emma's score = 10x + 5y + 30z
- Ava's score = 10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(z + 4)

Simplifying the expressions:
- Emma's score = 10x + 5y + 30z
- Ava's score = 10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 30z + 120
- Ava's score = 10x + 5y + 30z + 195

Now, let's find the difference between their scores:
Difference = Ava's score - Emma's score
Difference = (10x + 5y + 30z + 195) - (10x + 5y + 30z)
Difference = 195

The final answer is: $\boxed{195}$"
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to find the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. 

Two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, so the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the cost of the other two pizzas. 

Total cost of all four pizzas = 64 dollars
Cost of two known pizzas = 60 dollars
Cost of the other two pizzas = Total cost of all four pizzas - Cost of two known pizzas
Cost of the other two pizzas = 64 - 60
Cost of the other two pizzas = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the cost by 2 to find the cost of one pizza.

Cost of one pizza = Cost of the other two pizzas / 2
Cost of one pizza = 4 / 2
Cost of one pizza = 2 dollars

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

They ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days, so the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, so they ride 3 * 2 = 6 times on each of these days.

The total number of times they ride on the two extra days is 6 * 2 = 12.

The total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is 15 + 12 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as W and the number of orange fish Bob bought as O.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had 3 + O orange fish and 4 + W white fish.

Since he had twice as many orange fish as white fish after buying more fish, we can set up the equation:

3 + O = 2(4 + W)

Simplifying the equation:

3 + O = 8 + 2W

Subtract 3 from both sides:

O = 5 + 2W

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, which is the sum of the white and orange fish he bought:

W + O = 17

Substitute the expression for O from the previous equation:

W + (5 + 2W) = 17

Combine like terms:

3W + 5 = 17

Subtract 5 from both sides:

3W = 12

Divide both sides by 3:

W = 4

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total miles driven per week and then multiply it by the fuel efficiency and the price of gas.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per week:
- Distance to work: 5 miles (one way)
- Since it's a round trip, we multiply the distance by 2: 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles per day
- Total miles driven per week: 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles/week

Now, let's calculate the fuel consumption per week:
- Fuel efficiency: 10 MPG
- Total miles driven per week: 50 miles
- Fuel consumption per week: 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week

Finally, let's calculate the total cost per week:
- Price of gas: $3/gallon
- Fuel consumption per week: 5 gallons
- Total cost per week: 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15/week

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to find the total fraction of TVs that are not OLED. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8.

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 8. 
1/4 can be written as 2/8. 

Now we can add the fractions: 
2/8 + 1/8 = 3/8

This means that 3/8 of the TVs are not OLED. To find the fraction of OLED TVs, we subtract this from 1 (the whole): 
1 - 3/8 = 5/8

Now we can multiply this fraction by the total number of TVs sold (40) to find the number of OLED TVs sold: 
5/8 * 40 = (5 * 40) / 8 = 200 / 8 = 25

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first determine how much the school will cover. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we can calculate this as:

Half of $300 = $300 / 2 = $150

The school will cover $150, and John has $50. To find out how much John is missing, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost of the trip minus the amount the school will cover:

Total cost of the trip = $300
Amount the school will cover = $150
Amount John has = $50

Amount John is missing = Total cost of the trip - Amount the school will cover - Amount John has
= $300 - $150 - $50

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature at night. 

Given that it's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, and it was 45 degrees during the day, we can calculate the temperature at night as follows:

Night temperature = Day temperature - 33
Night temperature = 45 - 33
Night temperature = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, we need to find out how many degrees the temperature needs to be raised to prevent freezing.

Degrees to be raised = Night temperature - Freezing temperature
Degrees to be raised = 12 - 32
Degrees to be raised = -20 degrees

However, since we can't burn a negative number of logs, we need to find out how many degrees the house needs to be raised to reach 32 degrees. 

Degrees to be raised = Freezing temperature - Night temperature
Degrees to be raised = 32 - 12
Degrees to be raised = 20 degrees

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we can find out how many logs Carson needs to burn as follows:

Number of logs = Degrees to be raised / Degrees per log
Number of logs = 20 / 5
Number of logs = 4

"To find the total number of seashells, we need to first find the number of groups and then the number of groups that brought back seashells. 

First, we find the number of groups: 
Number of people = 90
Number of people per group = 9
Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Now, we find the number of groups that brought back seashells: 
Fraction of groups that brought back seashells = 3/5
Number of groups that brought back seashells = Number of groups * Fraction of groups that brought back seashells
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 6

Now, we find the total number of seashells: 
Number of seashells per group = 2
Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total number of seashells = 6 * 2
Total number of seashells = 12

Number of puppies = 3
Number of koalas = 5
Number of zebras = 2
Number of frogs = 4

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Since Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up the equation:

Number of stuffed goats / Total number of stuffed animals = 0.30

Let's say the number of stuffed goats she buys is x. Then the total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats will be 14 + x.

We can set up the equation as follows:

x / (14 + x) = 0.30

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

x = 0.30 * (14 + x)

Distribute 0.30:

x = 4.2 + 0.30x

Subtract 0.30x from both sides:

0.70x = 4.2

Divide both sides by 0.70:

x = 6

So Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats."

"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group of students drank and add them together.

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so the total amount they drank is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so the total amount they drank is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we need to convert the total amount of tea consumed from quarts to gallons. 

38 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 9.5 gallons.

Now, we need to find the initial amount of tea. We know that 9.5 gallons were consumed, and there are 4 quarts in a gallon. So, the initial amount of tea in quarts is 9.5 * 4 = 38 quarts.

Since we already know that there are 10 quarts of tea left, we can find the initial amount of tea by adding the amount left to the amount consumed.

Initial amount of tea = 38 quarts (consumed) + 10 quarts (left) = 48 quarts.

To convert the initial amount of tea from quarts to gallons, we divide by 4.

Initial amount of tea in gallons = 48 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 12 gallons.

Since Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, we have f = z.

Since Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, we have s = s.

Since Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, we have o = 2s.

Since Tanya uses twice as much salt as zest, we have s = 2z.

Substituting s = 2z into o = 2s, we get o = 2(2z) = 4z.

Since the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, we have z + f + s + s + o = 10.

Substituting f = z and s = 2z into the equation, we get z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10.

Combine like terms: 10z = 10.

Divide both sides by 10: z = 1.

Now that we know z = 1, we can find o = 4z = 4(1) = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount spent by John, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

Cost of 3 goats: 3 x $500 = $1500

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars. So, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2: 40 * 0.2 = 8. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

4. Now, let's find out how many cars Joe has left. He started with 40 cars, sold 8, and gave away 16. So, he has 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine how much money the students raised in total. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the amount raised by the students is:

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Now, we know that 20 students raised $125,000 in total. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount by the number of students:

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 
On the second day, she walked half as many hours as the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

Now, we need to convert the total hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we multiply the total hours by 60.

Total hours = 8 + 4 = 12 hours
Total minutes = 12 * 60 = 720 minutes

"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we find the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break. 
   Initial number of cars = 50
   Number of cars added during the first break = 20
   Total number of cars after the first break = 50 + 20 = 70

2. Then, we find the number of cars that left the parking lot during the lunch break. 
   Number of cars that left = 1/2 of the total number of cars after the first break
   Number of cars that left = 1/2 * 70 = 35

3. Now, we find the total number of cars in the parking lot during the lunch break. 
   Total number of cars during the lunch break = Total number of cars after the first break - Number of cars that left
   Total number of cars during the lunch break = 70 - 35 = 35

Daily earnings = Number of cycles per day * Number of tasks per cycle * Pay per task
Daily earnings = 30 * 5 * $1.20
Daily earnings = 180 * $1.20
Daily earnings = $216

To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he works in a week.

Number of days in a week: 7
Weekly earnings = Daily earnings * Number of days in a week
Weekly earnings = $216 * 7

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write this as an equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs.

She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had (1/3) * 9 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

1. Time spent on TikTok videos: 
   Britany records 18 videos each week, and each video takes 4 minutes. 
   So, time spent on videos = 18 * 4 = 72 minutes per week.

2. Time spent writing amateur songs: 
   Britany spends 2 hours per week writing amateur songs. 
   Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 
   Time spent writing amateur songs = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes per week.

3. Time spent doing makeup: 
   Britany spends 15 minutes, 6 days a week doing her makeup. 
   So, time spent doing makeup per week = 15 * 6 = 90 minutes per week.

4. Total time spent on TikTok per week:

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of the initial installation is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures, we need to calculate the cost of the additional items.

Additional mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors
Additional chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier
Additional pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 pictures

The cost of the additional items is:
2 mirrors * $15.00 = $30.00
1 chandelier * $15.00 = $15.00
10 pictures * $15.00 = $150.00

Total cost of additional items: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to find out how high Saskay can lift a mountain, then multiply it by 4 to find out how high Kagiyami can lift a mountain, and then multiply that by 10 to find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, Saskay can lift 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we need to convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12.

480 / 12 = 40 feet

Erika has been paid $150 and her mom gave her $80, so the total amount of money she received is:
$150 + $80 = $230

Since she only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, we can set up an equation to find out how much money she has in her purse:
Let x be the amount of money Erika has in her purse.
x + $230 = $400 + $50

"Let's denote my age as 'x'. Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age is x + 3. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so her age is 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of all our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78

Divide both sides by 5: x = 15.6

Since age cannot be a decimal, we need to re-examine the equation. The error is likely due to the fact that we assumed the ages are whole numbers. Let's re-examine the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78

Divide both sides by 5: x = 15.6

However, since age cannot be a decimal, we need to re-examine the equation again. Let's try to find the closest whole number that satisfies the equation. We can round 15.6 to 16.

Let's check if x = 16 satisfies the equation: 16 + (16 + 3) + (16 - 2) + 3(16 + 3) - 1 = 16 + 19 + 14 + 51 - 1 = 99

Since 99 is not equal to 87, we need to try another whole number. Let's try x = 15.

Let's check if x = 15 satisfies the equation: 15 + (15 + 3) + (15 - 2) + 3(15 + 3) - 1 = 15 + 18 + 13 + 48 - 1 = 93

Since 93 is not equal to 87, we need to try another whole number. Let's try x = 14.

Let's check if x = 14 satisfies the equation: 14 + (14 + 3) + (14 - 2) + 3(14 + 3) - 1 = 14 + 17 + 12 + 45 - 1 = 87

Since 87 is equal to 87, x = 14 satisfies the equation.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required and then divide that by the number of glue sticks per pack.

Total number of students: 27
Number of glue sticks per student: 2
Total number of glue sticks required: 27 * 2 = 54

Number of glue sticks per pack: 8
Number of packs required: 54 / 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to calculate the amount of water on the first day, the second day, and the third day, and then add them together.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Now, we add the amount of water on each day: 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: 24000"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. The number of people infected each day is six times the number of people infected the previous day, plus the number of people infected the previous day (since the people from the previous day are still infected).

Day 1: 10 people are infected initially.
Day 2: 10 * 6 = 60 new people are infected, plus the 10 from the previous day, so 60 + 10 = 70 people are infected.
Day 3: 70 * 6 = 420 new people are infected, plus the 70 from the previous day, so 420 + 70 = 490 people are infected.

The final answer is: 490"
"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of the amount Rafaela received and subtract it from Rafaela's total. 

Rafaela received 40 * $20 = $800.

10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80.

So, Julieta received $800 - $80 = $720.

The total amount they received altogether is $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to first calculate the total number of oranges given to her children.

Jennifer gave her 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so the total number of oranges given to her daughters is 3 x 2 = 6 oranges.

She also gave her son 3 oranges.

In total, Jennifer gave away 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges, so to find out how many she remained with, we subtract the number of oranges given away from the total number of oranges bought:

12 - 9 = 3

"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each person is:
- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices sold and then multiply it by the price per slice.

Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, she baked 2 * 5 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * $0.50 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to find the number of silver coins first. 

Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We know that G = S + 30 and G = 70.

Since G = S + 30 and G = 70, we can set up the equation S + 30 = 70.

To find S, we need to isolate S on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation:

S + 30 - 30 = 70 - 30
S = 40

Now that we know S = 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver coins and gold coins:

Total coins = S + G
Total coins = 40 + 70
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos eaten by the students and Mr. George.

Number of students = 50
Number of burritos per student = 10
Total burritos eaten by students = 50 * 10 = 500

Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

Total burritos eaten = 500 (by students) + 20 (by Mr. George) = 520

Total burritos ordered = 600

Total leftover burritos = Total burritos ordered - Total burritos eaten
= 600 - 520
= 80

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Number of red cars: 12
- Number of green cars: 2 fewer than red cars, so 12 - 2 = 10 green cars
- Number of blue cars: 3 times the number of green cars, so 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars
- Total number of cars: 75

We know the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 cars
To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars: 75 - 52 = 23

The number of yellow cars is 23."
"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We are given the following information:

1. S + A + F = 85 (Together, they have 85 books)
2. S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get:
(A + 25) + A + F = 85
Combine like terms:
2A + 25 + F = 85

Now, we can substitute the third equation into the above equation to get:
2(F - 12) + 25 + F = 85
Expand the equation:
2F - 24 + 25 + F = 85
Combine like terms:
3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3:
F = 28

The final answer is: 28"
"To find the weight of the carrots, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the weight of the carrots is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The weight of the carrots is 7 pounds."
"To find out how many boxes of jello Greg needs, we need to calculate the total number of jello cups he needs. Since each kid will have 4 jello cups, and there are 30 kids, the total number of jello cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120.

Since one box of jello makes 10 jello cups, the number of boxes needed is 120 / 10 = 12.

The cost of one box of jello is $1.25, so the total cost will be 12 * $1.25 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total cost of the phones, we multiply the number of phones by the cost per phone: 
5 phones * $700/phone = $3500

The seller gives the seller $4000 in dollar bills. To find the change, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given: 
$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to find out how much Keenan spends in a month. 

Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

40% of $400 = 0.4 * 400 = $160

This is the amount Keenan pays in a month. 

To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide the monthly amount by 4.

$160 / 4 = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many pieces Tobias ate in total, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate on each day and add them together.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5:
(2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find the remaining pieces after the first two days, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26:
(7/13) * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

Now, we add the pieces eaten on each day to find the total:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda, we need to divide the total cost of 7 bottles of soda by 7 and then multiply by 3. 

Cost of 1 bottle of soda = $21.00 / 7 = $3.00
Cost of 3 bottles of soda = $3.00 * 3 = $9.00

To find the cost of 2 bottles of water, we need to divide the total cost of 4 bottles of water by 4 and then multiply by 2.

Cost of 1 bottle of water = $8.00 / 4 = $2.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = $2.00 * 2 = $4.00

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she gets from each type of question and add them together.

Multiple-choice questions: 
Amy correctly answers 80% of 10 questions, so she answers 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correctly.
Each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, so she gets 8 * 1 = 8 points from multiple-choice questions.

True/false questions: 
Amy correctly answers 90% of 20 questions, so she answers 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correctly.
Each true/false question is worth 1 point, so she gets 18 * 1 = 18 points from true/false questions.

Long-answer questions: 
Amy correctly answers 60% of 5 questions, so she answers 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correctly.

"To find out how much money Isaias made from selling the chickens, we first need to find out how many chickens he sold. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens, we can calculate this as follows:

3/5 * 300 = (3 * 300) / 5
= 900 / 5
= 180

So, Isaias sold 180 chickens.

Now, we know that he made a profit of $2000 by selling these chickens at $50 each. To find out the total amount he made from selling the chickens, we can multiply the number of chickens sold by the price per chicken:

180 * $50 = $9000

However, this is the amount he made from selling the chickens, not the amount he spent to buy them. To find out how much he spent, we need to subtract the profit from the amount he made:

$9000 - $2000 = $7000

So, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 2, since they sold an equal number of glasses. 

Total glasses sold = 32

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Melanie's present age be x.

In 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. This means that her present age (x) plus 10 years will equal 18. We can write this as an equation:

x + 10 = 18

To find Melanie's present age, we need to solve for x. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

x = 18 - 10
x = 8

So, Melanie's present age is 8 years.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's call this number y. We can write this as an equation:

Melanie's age in y years = 3 * Melanie's present age
8 + y = 3 * 8

To find y, we can simplify the equation:

8 + y = 24

Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

y = 24 - 8
y = 16

So, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age in 16 years.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total.

Next, let's find the cost of the chicken: Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each pack of chicken costs $10 / 5 = $2. Since Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $2 = $12.

Now, let's find the cost of the strawberries: Each pack of strawberries costs $4.

Finally, let's find the cost of the apples: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2. Since Kelly has 7 packs of apples, the total cost of the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $12 (chicken) + $24 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $60 = $5.

"Let's denote the runtime of Elaina's usual concert as 'x' minutes. 

Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, the runtime of the final concert without the encore is 2x minutes. 

The total runtime of the final concert, including the encore, is 65 minutes. 

We can set up the equation: 2x + 15 = 65

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 
2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:
x = 50 / 2
x = 25

"To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs. 

Let's assume the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is x. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the total number of microphones arranged in pairs is 2x.

However, we know that 20% of the total 50 microphones won't find any space to fit in. This means that 80% of the microphones will be arranged in pairs. 

We can set up the equation: 80% of 50 = 2x

To find 80% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.8 (since 80% = 80/100 = 0.8)
50 * 0.8 = 40

Now we have the equation: 40 = 2x

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
x = 40 / 2
x = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, let's find the number of birds flying overhead. 2/3 of the birds in the bushes are flying overhead. Since there are 6 birds in the bushes, we multiply 6 by 2/3.

6 * (2/3) = 4

So, 4 birds are flying overhead.

Next, let's find the number of birds feeding. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we multiply 3 by 8.

3 * 8 = 24

Now, we add the number of birds in the bushes, flying overhead, and feeding to find the total number of birds.

6 (in the bushes) + 4 (flying overhead) + 24 (feeding) = 34

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we can divide both sides of the equation by 11:

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. Since the whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob, we can multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55

"Let's denote the price of one carrot as 'c'. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, the price of the yogurt is 6 / 2 = 3 dollars.

The total cost of Ellen's daily goods is the sum of the cost of two carrots, one salad, and one yogurt. This can be represented by the equation: 2c + 6 + 3 = 11.

Combine the constants: 2c + 9 = 11.

Subtract 9 from both sides of the equation: 2c = 2.

Divide both sides of the equation by 2: c = 1.

"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is 3x. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is 5x.

The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is the sum of the amounts she made from mowing each lawn, which is 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x.

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns. Since she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, the amount she made from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns is 54x - 6.

We can set up the equation: 54x - 6 + y = 80, where y is the amount she made from lemonade sales.

Simplifying the equation, we get 54x + y = 86.

We know that Tasha made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, so we can substitute x = 1 into the equation 54x + y = 86.

54(1) + y = 86
54 + y = 86

Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Martha initially had x notebooks. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3x notebooks.

Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so she now has x + 5 notebooks.

We are also given that after buying 5 more notebooks, Martha had a total of 7 notebooks. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 5 = 7

To solve for x, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

x = 7 - 5
x = 2

So, Martha initially had 2 notebooks. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3x = 3(2) = 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has 6 notebooks, so the difference is:

7 - 6 = 1

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first find the distance rowed by Anis. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. 

1/5 of 50 miles is 50 * 1/5 = 10 miles. 

So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

The total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis is 50 + 60 = 110 miles.

"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we first need to subtract the cookies that Susan's husband took from the total number of cookies. 

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by Susan's husband = 4
Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by Susan's husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews to find out how many each will get.

Number of nephews = 6
Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today.

So, Denise's total pages read is 10 + 18 = 28 pages. 
Daniel's total pages read is 13 pages.

The difference between Denise's and Daniel's total pages read is 28 - 13 = 15 pages.

The final answer is 15."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bowls of soup Calvin's family will use for dinner. 

Since Calvin, his wife, and their two children are eating, that's a total of 3 adults and 2 children, which equals 5 people. 

Since each adult's bowl is equivalent to 1/4 of the pot's capacity and each child's bowl is equivalent to 1/8 of the pot's capacity, we can say that 4 adult bowls are equivalent to 8 child bowls. 

For dinner, 5 people will eat, which is 5 adult bowls or 10 child bowls. 

Since 4 adult bowls are equivalent to 8 child bowls, 5 adult bowls will be equivalent to 10 child bowls. 

So, the family will use 10 child bowls for dinner. 

Now, we need to find out how many child bowls are left. The pot can fill 8 child bowls. 

To find the leftover child bowls, we subtract the number of child bowls used from the total capacity: 8 - 10 = -2. However, since we can't have a negative number of bowls, this means that the pot is not enough to fill 10 child bowls. 

So, the family will use 8 child bowls for dinner, and there will be 0 child bowls left."
"To find the total amount William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the cost of the ballpen, then add them together.

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to first determine the amount of material required for each type of mask and then multiply it by the number of masks she wants to make.

For small masks: 2 yards of material makes 4 small masks. 
To find the material needed for 1 small mask, we divide 2 yards by 4 masks: 2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards per small mask.

For large masks: 2.25 yards of material makes 3 large masks. 
To find the material needed for 1 large mask, we divide 2.25 yards by 3 masks: 2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards per large mask.

Now, we multiply the material needed for each type of mask by the number of masks Jo wants to make:
- For small masks: 0.5 yards/mask * 20 masks = 10 yards
- For large masks: 0.75 yards/mask * 8 masks = 6 yards

To find the total amount of material needed, we add the material required for small and large masks: 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. 
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours a day.
He walks his dog for 1 hour a day.

Total hours spent: 10 (sleep) + 8 (work) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours

Free time = Total hours in a day - Total hours spent
Free time = 24 - 19
Free time = 5 hours

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. 

Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write the equation: 
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
(60 - 8) = 2 * (x - 4)
52 = 2x - 8

Now, let's solve for x:
52 + 8 = 2x
60 = 2x
x = 60 / 2
x = 30

So, Adam's age four years ago was 30. 

Now, we need to find Adam's age in 8 years. 
Adam's current age = x + 4 = 30 + 4 = 34
Adam's age in 8 years = 34 + 8 = 42

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. 
Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 
Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 
100 acres more than 400 acres is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the number of acres in both farms to find the total number of acres. 
200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The final answer is: 700"
"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to first determine how many packages he completes in an hour and then multiply that by the number of hours he works and his hourly wage.

Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

In an eight-hour workday, he would complete 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, his total earnings for the day would be 320 * $0.20 = $64.

The final answer is $64."
"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku and then divide it by the time it takes to drink one bottle of water.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so an extreme sudoku takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to convert the time from minutes to half hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 2 half hours in an hour. 

180 minutes is equal to 180 / 30 = 6 half hours.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, he drinks 6 bottles of water in 6 half hours.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as y. Since there are 20 red balloons, the total number of balloons is 20 + y.

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of bologna pieces thrown at red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, so the total number of bologna pieces thrown at yellow balloons is 3 * y.

The total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58, so we can set up the equation:

40 + 3y = 58

Subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

3y = 18

Divide both sides of the equation by 3:

y = 6

The number of yellow balloons in the bundle is 6."
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days. 

Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so the total miles driven is 100 * 30 = 3000 miles.

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we need to divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs.

3000 miles / 1000 miles per tune-up = 3 tune-ups.

"To find out how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. 1 dozen balloons is equal to 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, 12 balloons will cost 12 * $0.5 = $6.

The total cost of the cake and the balloons is $11 + $6 = $17.

They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total cost of the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount of money they spent is $17 + $14 = $31.

Since they spent $31 in total, and they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount by 2 to find out how much each of them received. 

$31 / 2 = $15.50

"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to find the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea in each row. 

Since Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, we divide 27 by 3 to get the number of cups in each row: 27 / 3 = 9 cups per row.

Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is half of the total cups in each row: 9 / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea per row.

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a cup, we can assume that Lana will make whole cups of tea. Therefore, she will make 4 cups of mint tea in each row and 5 cups of chamomile tea in each row, as 9 - 4 = 5.

- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Colby has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since he wants to spend $8 on popcorn and $2 on candy, he will have $20 - $8 - $2 = $10 left for movie tickets.

Each movie ticket costs $10, so he can see $10 / $10 = 1 more movie.

We are given the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old: P + p + j = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than John: p = j + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age: P = p + j

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get: P = (j + 10) + j
Combine like terms: P = 2j + 10

Now, substitute the expression for P into the first equation: (2j + 10) + p + j = 100
Substitute the second equation into this expression: (2j + 10) + (j + 10) + j = 100
Combine like terms: 4j + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides: 4j = 80
Divide both sides by 4: j = 20

Now that we know John's age, we can find Paul's age: p = j + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30

Finally, we can find Peter's age: P = p + j = 30 + 20 = 50

He buys 5 pencils for 10 dollars each, so we multiply the number of pencils by the cost of each pencil and subtract that from his remaining money: 
5 * 10 = 50 dollars. 
150 - 50 = 100 dollars.

Now, we need to find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining money: 
100 / 25 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 20 * 15 = 300.

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, so we add 50 to the total number of letters Craig spelled: 300 + 50 = 350.

Now, we add the total number of letters Craig spelled to the total number of letters his brother spelled: 300 + 350 = 650.

The final answer is: 650"
"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows and then multiply the result by the number of schools.

Number of children in each row: 8
Number of rows: 7
Number of schools: 5

First, multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows: 8 * 7 = 56
Then, multiply the result by the number of schools: 56 * 5 = 280

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to first calculate the total number of bottles she gives to the students. 

There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58.

The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she can get is 9 * 100 = 900.

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher can get: 900 - 58 = 842.

The final answer is: 842"
"To find the total charge, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the parts cost and the initial visit charge.

Labor cost = $35 per hour * 2.25 hours = $78.75
Parts cost = $60
Initial visit charge = $40

Total charge = Labor cost + Parts cost + Initial visit charge
Total charge = $78.75 + $60 + $40
Total charge = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To find the total cost of the CDs, we first need to find the original price and then apply the 40% discount.

Original price of 1 CD = $15
Total number of CDs = 10
Original total price = 10 * $15 = $150

Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60
Price after discount = $150 - $60 = $90

James sells 5 CDs for $40 each, so the total amount he gets from selling them is:
5 * $40 = $200

However, he bought the CDs for $90, so the amount he was out is the difference between the selling price and the cost price:
$200 - $90 = $110

The final answer is: $110"
"To find out how much Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of root crop and then add them together.

The earnings from yams: 6 yams * $1.5 = $9
The earnings from sweet potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes * $2 = $20
The earnings from carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25 = $5

Now, let's add the earnings from each type of root crop together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the time James took to swim 60% of the distance.
Distance = 20 miles
Speed = 2 miles per hour
Time = Distance / Speed = 20 / 2 = 10 hours
60% of the distance is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles
Time taken to swim 12 miles = 12 / 2 = 6 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time James rested on the island.
Time taken to swim 12 miles = 6 hours
Time rested = 6 / 2 = 3 hours

Step 3: Calculate the remaining distance.
Remaining distance = 20 - 12 = 8 miles

Step 4: Calculate the time James took to swim the remaining distance at half the speed.
Speed = 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour
Time = Distance / Speed = 8 / 1 = 8 hours

Step 5: Calculate the total time taken by James to get across the lake.
Total time = Time taken to swim 12 miles + Time rested + Time taken to swim the remaining distance
Total time = 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday and then subtract 40 from that result.

Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had, so we subtract 40 from 490: 490 - 40 = 450.

The final answer is: 450"
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to follow the order of events.

1. Jasmine starts with 15 stickers.

"To find the total commission earned by Cayley, we need to calculate the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal separately and then add them together.

Commission from New York Times: 
- Number of copies sold: 6
- Price per copy: $5
- Commission percentage: 10%
- Commission per copy: 10% of $5 = 0.1 * $5 = $0.5
- Total commission from New York Times: 6 * $0.5 = $3

Commission from Wall Street Journal: 
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Price per copy: $15
- Commission percentage: 8%
- Commission per copy: 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.2
- Total commission from Wall Street Journal: 10 * $1.2 = $12

Total commission earned by Cayley: $3 + $12 = $15

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Deanna is 26 years old.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.
3. Marcus is half of Leo's age, so Leo's age is twice Marcus's age. 

To find Leo's age, we multiply Marcus's age by 2: 21 * 2 = 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D.

We know that B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
We also know that B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can set these two equations equal to each other:
A + 20 = D + 10

Now, we can rewrite the equation as A - D = -10.

We also know that the total points scored by the team is 45, so A + B + D = 45. We can substitute B with A + 20 and D with A - 10 (from the equation A - D = -10) into the total points equation:
A + (A + 20) + (A - 10) = 45

Combine like terms:
3A + 10 = 45

Subtract 10 from both sides:
3A = 35

Divide both sides by 3:
A = 35/3
A = 11.67

However, since points must be a whole number, we need to re-examine the equation A - D = -10. If A is not a whole number, then D must be a whole number. We can try different values of A to find a whole number for D.

Let's try A = 12:
12 - D = -10
D = 22

Now, we can check if A + B + D = 45:
12 + (12 + 20) + 22 = 66, which is not equal to 45.

Let's try A = 11:
11 - D = -10
D = 21

Now, we can check if A + B + D = 45:
11 + (11 + 20) + 21 = 63, which is not equal to 45.

Let's try A = 10:
10 - D = -10
D = 20

Now, we can check if A + B + D = 45:
10 + (10 + 20) + 20 = 60, which is not equal to 45.

Let's try A = 9:
9 - D = -10
D = 19

Now, we can check if A + B + D = 45:
9 + (9 + 20) + 19 = 57, which is not equal to 45.

Let's try A = 8:
8 - D = -10
D = 18

Now, we can check if A + B + D = 45:
8 + (8 + 20) + 18 = 54, which is not equal to 45.

Let's try A = 7:
7 - D = -10
D = 17

Now, we can check if A + B + D = 45:
7 + (7 + 20) + 17 = 51, which is not equal to 45.

Let's try A = 6:
6 - D = -10
D = 16

Now, we can check if A + B + D = 45:
6 + (6 + 20) + 16 = 48, which is not equal to 45.

Let's try A = 5:
5 - D = -10
D = 15

Now, we can check if A + B + D = 45:
5 + (5 + 20) + 15 = 45

First, let's find the total time in minutes: 
11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, let's find the total number of reports stapled:
Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. 
So, the number of reports stapled per minute is 30 / 15 = 2 reports/minute
Total reports stapled = 2 reports/minute * 900 minutes = 1800 reports

"To find the total minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total minutes she slept and subtract the minutes she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. So, her usual sleep duration is 8 hours. 

8 hours = 8 * 60 minutes = 480 minutes

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so her actual wake-up time is 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

Her actual sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. 

10 p.m. to 12 a.m. = 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
12 a.m. to 2:15 a.m. = 2 hours 15 minutes = 2 * 60 + 15 = 135 minutes
2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. = 3 hours 40 minutes = 3 * 60 + 40 = 220 minutes

Total minutes she slept = 120 + 135 + 220 = 475 minutes

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. 
2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes

Total minutes she was sleepwalking = 23 minutes

Total minutes she slept on her bed = Total minutes she slept - Total minutes she was sleepwalking
= 475 - 23
= 452 minutes

"To find the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially, we need to first find the number of measuring cups he has. Since he has two dozen cups, we multiply 2 by 12 to get the total number of cups.

2 * 12 = 24 cups

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we multiply the number of cups by 2/3 to find the number of spoons.

24 * (2/3) = 16 spoons

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, we subtract 6 from the initial number of spoons to find the remaining number of spoons.

16 - 6 = 10 spoons

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the remaining spoons and the number of cups.

24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils

"To find the number of occupied beds, we need to calculate 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital. 

1/5 of 1000 = 100

Since 1/5 of the beds are occupied, 4/5 of the beds are unoccupied. 

4/5 of 1000 = 800

Now, we need to find the number of occupied beds after 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks.

There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 14 days.

Total patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 * 14 = 700

Now, we need to find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks. 

Initial occupied beds = 100
Additional occupied beds = 700
Total occupied beds = 100 + 700 = 800

Now, we need to find the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.

Total capacity = 1000
Total occupied beds = 800
Total unoccupied beds = 1000 - 800 = 200

"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as x. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason carried 2x balls. Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2 * 2x = 4x balls.

We know that the total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them. So, the total number of balls is x + 2x + 4x = 7x.

We are also given that Jason carried 2 balls. Since Jason carried 2x balls, we can set up the equation 2x = 2 and solve for x.

2x = 2
x = 1

Now that we know x = 1, we can find the total number of balls by substituting x into the equation 7x.

Total number of balls = 7x

"To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to first determine the total number of holes at the end of the third day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes the first day, 13 holes the second day, and 8 holes the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40.

Now, we know that the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 29, and the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 40. This means that the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got as x. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so we can set up the equation:

x = 70

Since Collins got x + 15 corn chips, we can set up the equation:

x + 15 = 70 + 15 (since Collins got 15 more than the others)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 15 = 85

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get:

x = 70

This confirms that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each.

Now, let's find the total number of corn chips. We know that Collins got x + 15 corn chips, which is 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got:

Total = x + x + (x + 15)
Total = 2x + (x + 15)
Total = 3x + 15
Total = 3(70) + 15
Total = 210 + 15
Total = 225

We are given the following information:
1. A + S + L = 339
2. L = S + 5

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to get:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the third equation into the above equation:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand the equation:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and then add it to the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

Distance = speed * time

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction for the first 10 hours:
Distance1 = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles

Then, the bird flies towards the north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour:
Distance2 = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles

Since this distance is in the opposite direction, we need to subtract it from the first distance:
Distance3 = 300 miles - 36 miles = 264 miles

Finally, the bird flies towards the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour:
Distance4 = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Now, we add the distances traveled in the southerly direction:
Total distance = Distance1 + Distance4 = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles

"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to add the brownies she made, the ones she took home from the office, and the ones her friends had waiting at home.

Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so she made 12 brownies.

She took home 1/2 a dozen brownies from the office. 1/2 a dozen is equal to 6, so she took home 6 brownies.

Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting at home. 4 dozen is equal to 48, so her friends had 48 brownies.

Now, let's add the brownies together: 12 (Greta's brownies) + 6 (brownies from the office) + 48 (brownies from her friends) = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. 1 1/2 dozen is equal to 18, so 18 brownies were eaten.

To find the number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies: 66 (total brownies) - 18 (brownies eaten) = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we need to multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form).

Nani's sister's age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of all three family members: Nani (8 years), his brother (16 years), and his sister (6 years).

"Let's denote the number of cherries Richard has as R, the number of cherries Jerry has as J, and the number of cherries Robert has as B. 

We know that B = 30 and B = R + 10. 

From the first equation, we can substitute B in the second equation: 
30 = R + 10
R = 30 - 10
R = 20

We also know that the total number of cherries is 60, so R + J + B = 60. 
Substituting the values of R and B, we get:
20 + J + 30 = 60
J = 60 - 20 - 30
J = 10

Now, we need to find the difference between Robert's and Jerry's cherries: B - J = 30 - 10 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.
- On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so G = 10.
- On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so A = Sunday's apple pie - 4.
- On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so Sunday's gingerbread = G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.
- On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's find the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday:
Sunday's apple pie = A + 4 = 15 + 4 = 19.

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on Saturday and Sunday:
- Saturday's gingerbread: 10
- Saturday's apple pie: 15
- Sunday's gingerbread: 15
- Sunday's apple pie: 19

Total boxes of gingerbread sold = 10 + 15 = 25
Total boxes of apple pie sold = 15 + 19 = 34

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
- Total earnings from gingerbread = 25 * $6 = $150
- Total earnings from apple pie = 34 * $15 = $510
- Total earnings for two days = $150 + $510 = $660

The final answer is: $660"
"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total number of ounces she will use and divide it by the number of ounces in each bottle.

Pamela will be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days, so she will be outside a total of 4 * 8 = 32 hours.

Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour, she will use 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.

Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she will need, we divide the total number of ounces she will use (32) by the number of ounces in each bottle (8):

32 / 8 = 4

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

Price of blue car = $100
Discount = 40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40

Price of red car = Price of blue car - Discount
= $100 - $40
= $60

So, the price of the red car is $60 and the price of the blue car is $100.

The final answer is: $160"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is 19 years old now.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

From point 3, we can write an equation:

24 = 2x, where x is the brother's age when Emil turns 24.

Solving for x, we get:
x = 24 / 2
x = 12

This means the brother is 12 years old when Emil turns 24.

From point 2, we can write another equation:

24 = (1/2) * dad's age when Emil turns 24

Let's call the dad's age when Emil turns 24 as 'D'. Then:

24 = (1/2) * D
D = 24 * 2
D = 48

This means the dad is 48 years old when Emil turns 24.

Now, we need to find the current age of the dad and the brother.

The dad's current age is 48 - 5 = 43 (since Emil is 19 now and will turn 24 in 5 years).
The brother's current age is 12 - 5 = 7 (since the brother is 12 when Emil turns 24 and Emil is 19 now).

The sum of the ages of the dad and the brother now is:
43 + 7 = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to add the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (mother) + 30 (sister) + 40 (friend) = 90 beads.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the number of football players, we need to calculate 20% of 30 students. 
20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

The remaining students are 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Now, we need to find 25% of the remaining 24 students to determine the number of cheerleaders or band members.
25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

The total number of students leaving early is the sum of football players and cheerleaders or band members.
6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. 

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie's boots are size 5, we multiply 5 by 5 to get Charlie's boot size: 
5 * 5 = 25

Now, we need to find the average of Sophie's and Charlie's boot sizes. To do this, we add their sizes and divide by 2: 
(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to first convert the width of the flower bed from feet to inches, since the width of the plants is given in inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches
So, 1.5 feet = 1.5 * 12 = 18 inches

Now, let's find the total width of the flower bed in inches:
111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Since Pat needs to leave 18 inches between each plant, the total space taken by each plant and the space between them is 18 + 12 = 30 inches.

Now, let's find the total number of plants Pat can fit in her flower bed:
Total space in inches / space taken by each plant = 1332 / 30 = 44.4

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 44 plants.

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:
44 - 17 = 27 more flowers

Each flower costs $6, so the total amount Pat will spend at the store is:
27 * 6 = $162

The final answer is: $162"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate 1/2 of 18. 

1/2 of 18 = 18 / 2 = 9

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day by 7.

9 * 7 = 63

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00
The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Total cost = cost of petunias + cost of sweet potato vines = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers need 4 * 3 = 12 pounds of soil.
10 carnations need 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil.

The total amount of soil used for sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have a 30-pound bag of soil, the remaining amount of soil for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so they can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000.00 = 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00

Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, we need to find out how much she sets aside in a year.

$500.00 * 12 months = $6,000.00

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so we divide the total amount she sets aside in a year by the cost of one pair of shoes.

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many shrimp Emily can peel and cook per minute. 

First, let's find out how many shrimp Emily can cook per minute. She can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to find out how many shrimp she can cook per minute, we divide 30 by 10. 

30 / 10 = 3 shrimp per minute.

Now, let's find out how many shrimp Emily can peel per minute. We already know that she can peel 6 shrimp a minute.

Now, let's find out how many shrimp Emily can process (peel and cook) per minute. We add the number of shrimp she can peel per minute and the number of shrimp she can cook per minute. 

6 (peel) + 3 (cook) = 9 shrimp per minute.

Now, let's find out how many minutes it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp. We divide 90 by 9.

90 / 9 = 10 minutes.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature. 

First, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on low for 3 hours: 
Temperature change on low = -2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = -6 degrees

Next, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on high for 4 hours: 
Temperature change on high = -3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = -12 degrees

Now, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours: 
Temperature change when off = 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees

The net temperature change is the sum of the temperature changes: 
Net temperature change = -6 - 12 + 4 = -14 degrees

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. 
2. The time between two consecutive appearances of the comet is 75 years.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. 
   - This means Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.
4. Since the comet appears every 75 years, the time between the first and second appearances is 75 years.
   - This means Bill's dad saw the comet 75 years before Bill saw it for the second time.
5. Since Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, his dad was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he saw the comet.
6. However, we are asked to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. 
   - Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, and the comet appears every 75 years, the time between the first and second appearances is 75 years.
   - This means Bill was 30 years old when his dad saw the comet, and 30 + 75 = 105 years have passed since then.
   - Therefore, Bill was 105 - 75 = 30 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each type and add them together.

1. Checks for the electric bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
2. Checks for the gas bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month, so 24 checks per year.
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 1 check every 3 months, so 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add the total number of checks: 
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

"Let's break down the information given:

- The first plane flies to Greece for 3/4 of its flights and splits the remaining 1/4 between France and Germany.
- The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.
- Since the second plane makes 44 trips, the first plane must make 2 * 44 = 88 trips.

Now, let's find out how many trips the first plane makes to Greece and the remaining trips are split between France and Germany. The first plane makes 3/4 of its 88 trips to Greece, which is (3/4) * 88 = 66 trips to Greece.

The remaining trips are split between France and Germany, which is 88 - 66 = 22 trips. Since these trips are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to find the individual howl times and add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the individual howl times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

Total amount received from parents = $6 + $12 = $18.

Now, subtract the total amount received from the cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings:
$30 (cost of trousers) - $18 (total received from parents) = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. We know that the total age of the children is 20, and Akbar and Alessandro are 3 and 4 years old, respectively. 

The total age of Akbar and Alessandro is 3 + 4 = 7. 

Since the total age of the children is 20, the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 20 - 7 = 13.

We are also given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's denote the average age of the group as A. Then, Helene's age is 2A.

The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 20/4 = 5. 

So, A = 5. 

Helene's age is 2A = 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we know that the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 13, and Helene is 10 years old. Therefore, Wilfred's age is 13 - 10 = 3.

"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to first find out the total amount collected by Walter from his neighbors and the online fund. 

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 

Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend gives him $200, but this is not included in the amount that Walter's lawyer will base his donation on. 

Walter's lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates, which is the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, $2000. 

So, the amount Walter's lawyer will contribute = 3 * $2000 = $6000

The final answer is $6000."
"To find the total number of cookies, we multiply the number of guests by the number of cookies each guest brought. 

Total cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

Since the bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church, we need to find 1/2 of 1500.

1/2 of 1500 = 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got.

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

"To solve this problem, let's assume the total watermelon is divided into 6 equal parts. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid, we can represent the size of each kid's slice as 'x'. Then, the size of each adult's slice would be '2x'.

Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6. 

The total size of the watermelon is 6x (since it's divided into 6 equal parts). 

The total size of the slices given to the adults is 2x * 2 = 4x. 

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to divide the total size of the slices given to the adults by the total size of the watermelon and multiply by 100.

Percentage = (4x / 6x) * 100 = (2/3) * 100 = 66.67%

The final answer is: 66.67"
"To find the total time spent on rounds, we need to multiply the number of inpatients by the time spent per inpatient. 

Time spent on rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the time spent on rounds to hours.

Time spent on rounds (in hours) = 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

To find the total time spent on appointments, we multiply the number of appointments by the time spent per appointment.

Time spent on appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes

Converting the time spent on appointments to hours:

Time spent on appointments (in hours) = 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

Total time spent at the clinic = Time spent on rounds + Time spent on appointments
= 3 hours + 5 hours
= 8 hours

Since Doctor Jones is spending 8 hours at the clinic, and he has 9 hours scheduled, we subtract the time spent at the clinic from the total scheduled time to find the time left for updating records.

Time left for updating records = 9 hours - 8 hours
= 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours and minutes:
180 minutes = 3 hours

To be ready to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract the total time required from the serving time. 

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, Jordan can start making the cake at 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We are given that they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation 8x = 64.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8: 
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, so it is rented 3 * 4 = 12 times in a month (assuming a 4-week month).

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25.

The cost of students per session is $1.50 per student, and there are 10 students, so the total cost of students per session is 10 * $1.50 = $15.

The total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $15 (students) = $40.

The total cost per month is $40 * 12 = $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as 'x'. Since Peter has 4 boxes, the total number of chocolate bars he has is 4x. We are given that this total is 64, so we can write the equation:

4x = 64

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 64 / 4
x = 16

Now, let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as 'y'. Since Martha has 7 boxes, the total number of chocolate bars she has is 7y. We are given that this total is 56, so we can write the equation:

7y = 56

To find the value of 'y', we divide both sides of the equation by 7:

y = 56 / 7
y = 8

Now that we know the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes, we can find the difference:

Difference = x - y
= 16 - 8

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed them to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need, we need to do that next.

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon.

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. 
Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. 
Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

The amount of water remaining in the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the initial charge of the power bank be x.

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining will be (1 - 0.09)^5 * x.

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining will be (1 - 0.07)^3 * (1 - 0.09)^5 * x.

We are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

(1 - 0.07)^3 * (1 - 0.09)^5 * x = 0.28

Now, let's simplify the equation:

(0.93)^3 * (0.91)^5 * x = 0.28

(0.863193) * (0.590485) * x = 0.28

0.509511 * x = 0.28

x = 0.28 / 0.509511

x = 0.549

"To find out how much Janet makes in a week, we need to add her wages and tips. 

Wages: $10/hour * 40 hours/week = $400/week
Tips: $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $600/week
Total weekly income: $400/week + $600/week = $1000/week

Now, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the car's cost. 

20% of $10000 = 0.20 * $10000 = $2000

Now, we need to find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000. 

Number of weeks = Total amount needed / Weekly income
= $2000 / $1000
= 2

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate how much money he has left after purchasing the other fruits. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:
- 3 peaches at $.5 each: 3 * $.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $.5 each: 4 * $.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $.75 each: 5 * $.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he has already purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Since plums cost $.25 each, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy:
$0.75 / $.25 = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. 

Anne kept 2 packs, so she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Since she gave the packs equally to 10 friends, each friend received 13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are in 1.3 packs. Since each pack has 60 pieces, we multiply 1.3 packs by 60 pieces per pack: 1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces.

However, since we can't divide packs into fractions, we can round down to 13 packs per friend and then calculate the remaining pieces from the remaining packs. 

13 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 780 pieces. 
780 pieces / 10 friends = 78 pieces per friend.

The remaining 2 packs will be distributed among the friends. 
2 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 120 pieces. 
120 pieces / 10 friends = 12 pieces per friend.

78 pieces per friend + 12 pieces per friend = 90 pieces per friend.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to first find the number of pictures in each album. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8 to find the number of pictures in each album.

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Since 3 albums were selfies only, the number of selfies is 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies.

The remaining albums are portraits, which is 8 albums - 3 selfies albums - 2 portrait albums = 3 albums. 

The number of portraits is 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 portraits.

The total number of portraits and selfies is 27 selfies + 27 portraits = 54.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the total time James spends reading, we need to first find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. 

Since it takes James 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can divide 10 minutes by 3 pages to get the time per page. 

10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we know James reads 18 pages. We can multiply the time per page by the total number of pages to get the total time spent reading.

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the current number of guests, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, there were 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the remaining guests are 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests checked out late, so the remaining guests are 76 - 15 = 61.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30.

So, the total number of guests after the afternoon check-ins is 61 + 30 = 91.

After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so the total number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The final answer is: 98"

"To find the number of points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of questions in each category and then find the number of questions Aries is sure to get in each category.

First, let's find the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:
- Total questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions
- Average and difficult questions: 60 - 24 = 36 questions
- Since the rest are equally divided as average and difficult questions, we have:
  - Average questions: 36 / 2 = 18 questions
  - Difficult questions: 36 / 2 = 18 questions

Now, let's find the number of questions Aries is sure to get in each category:
- Easy questions: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions
- Average questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9 questions

"Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 's' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'l'. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation:

s = 2l

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. Since Teresa sold large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * 4 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales is $120. We can write an equation based on the total earnings:

4s + 12l = 120

Substituting s = 2l into the equation, we get:

4(2l) + 12l = 120
8l + 12l = 120
20l = 120

Dividing both sides by 20, we get:

l = 6

Since s = 2l, we can substitute l = 6 into this equation to find the number of small stuffed animals:

s = 2(6)
s = 12

The final answer is: 12"

Next, let's calculate her earnings from selling cupcakes:
60 cupcakes * $4 each = $240

Now, let's add her earnings from cookies and cupcakes:
$80 + $240 = $320

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave a total of:
2 * $10 = $20

"To find the amount of ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe, we first need to find the amount he can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 2 * 12 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. So, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, we need to find the total amount of ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month. Since there are 30 days in a month, the total amount of ore one dwarf can mine in a month is 36 * 30 = 1080 pounds.

For 40 dwarves, the total amount of ore mined in a month is 40 * 1080 = 43200 pounds.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The ratio for the first package is 3/2, and for the second package is 6/4. We can simplify these ratios to 3/2 and 3/2. 

Since the ratios are the same, the price of the third package with 8 sandwiches will be proportional to the price of the second package. 

The price of the second package is $6 for 4 sandwiches. To find the price per sandwich, we divide the price by the number of sandwiches: $6 / 4 = $1.5 per sandwich.

Now, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches in the third package: $1.5 * 8 = $12.

"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to first calculate how much he still owes after selling his old bedroom set.

Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old bedroom for $1000. 

So, the amount he still owes is: 
$3000 (initial cost) - $1000 (amount received from selling old bedroom) = $2000

Now, he has to pay 10% of $2000 per month.

To find 10% of $2000, we multiply $2000 by 0.1 (since 10% = 10/100 = 0.1)
$2000 * 0.1 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 
40% of 25 is 0.4 * 25 = 10. 
So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. 
Half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6. 
So, 6 yellow balloons were released, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. 
So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's add up the remaining balloons: 
15 red balloons + 7 green balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 6 blue balloons = 34 balloons.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability of the complement of the event that he won't have to turn it in. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). 

However, the last scenario is dependent on the first two not happening. So, we need to find the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not convincing her, which is 60% (100% - 40%) * 80% (100% - 20%). 

Now, we can find the total probability of the first two scenarios happening: 50% + 60% * 40% = 50% + 24% = 74%. 

However, we need to add the last scenario to this total, but it's dependent on the first two not happening, so we need to subtract the probability of the first two scenarios from 100% to find the probability of the last scenario happening: 100% - 74% = 26%. 

Now, we can add this to the total: 74% + 26% = 100% - 26% = 74%. 

However, this is the probability that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework. To find the probability that he will have to turn it in, we need to subtract this from 100%: 100% - 74% = 26%.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of small beans Grandpa can eat in terms of the number of large beans. 

First, we know that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is 2 * 75 = 150.

We are also given that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, the number of small beans he can eat is 3 times the number of medium-sized beans. 

Therefore, the number of small beans Grandpa can eat is 3 * 150 = 450.

"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses.

Total earnings: 
Melissa is paid $15 per day for 3 days, so her total earnings are 15 * 3 = $45.

Total expenses: 
Melissa pays $3 for parking each day for 3 days, so her total expenses are 3 * 3 = $9.

Now, let's calculate her net earnings (total earnings - total expenses):
Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = 45 - 9
Net earnings = $36

Next, we need to find out how many hours she worked in total:
Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so the total hours she worked is 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and not working while in school. 

The total amount of loans is 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000.

The amount of money Jim lost by not working while in school is 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000.

The total amount of money Jim needs to earn is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After college, Jim's income triples, so his new income is $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

To find out how long it will take Jim to earn the total amount of $300,000, we can use the formula for simple interest:

Time = Total Amount / Annual Income
Time = $300,000 / $75,000
Time = 4 years

However, this is the time it would take to earn the money after college, but we need to consider the time spent in college as well. Since Jim spent 4 years in college, we need to add that to the time it takes to earn the money after college.

Total Time = Time to earn money after college + Time spent in college
Total Time = 4 years + 4 years
Total Time = 8 years

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday is 85 + 17 = 102. 
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 
5 more than twice as many as Tuesday is 204 + 5 = 209. 
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add up the number of letters delivered each day:

"Let's denote the share of the first person as x.

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the fraction of the day they worked.

First, let's convert 3 weeks to days: 
3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days

Now, let's find the total hours worked in 21 days:
3/8 of a day is the fraction of the day the painters worked each day. 
Since there are 24 hours in a day, 3/8 of a day is (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, let's find the total hours worked in 21 days:
Total hours = 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours

Now, let's divide the total hours by the number of painters and the fraction of the day they worked:
Total hours per painter = 189 hours / (4 painters * 1) = 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we need to combine like terms and isolate x. Multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4

"To find out how many gallons Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. 
So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups.

Now, we need to convert cups to gallons. 
There are 16 cups in a gallon. 
So, to find out how many gallons, we divide the total cups by 16. 
240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to calculate the number of people at each step.

Initially, there are 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. 
So, the total number of people becomes 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (2 * 50 = 100) board the train. 
So, the number of people who descended is 50, and the number of people who boarded is 100. 
The total number of people becomes 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. 
So, the total number of people becomes 190 - 80 = 110.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total amount Alison spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55

The final answer is: $55"
"To find the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to find the total number of tiles required and multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, we need to find the area of one tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of one tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Next, we need to find the total number of tiles required to cover the kitchen floor. We can do this by dividing the total area of the kitchen floor (200 SqFt) by the area of one tile (1 SqFt).

Total number of tiles = Total area of kitchen floor / Area of one tile
= 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt
= 200 tiles

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile.

Total cost = Total number of tiles * Cost of each tile
= 200 tiles * $12
= $2400

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost.

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72

Increased cost = Normal cost + Increased cost
= $120 + $72
= $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we need to multiply it by 12.

Annual cost = Increased cost * 12
= $192 * 12
= $2304

The final answer is: $2304"
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
- 4 twin beds = 4 * 2 = 8 twin sheets (since each twin bed requires 2 sheets)
- 1 king size bed = 1 * 1 = 1 king sheet (since each king size bed requires 1 sheet)

Total sheets per week = 8 (twin) + 1 (king) = 9 sheets

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets (4 sheets) and 1 king set (1 sheet) at a time, we need to find the maximum number of sets that can be washed in a week.

- 2 twin sets = 4 sheets
- 1 king set = 1 sheet

Total sets per week = 4 (twin) + 1 (king) = 5 sets

However, we need to consider that the laundry machine can only wash 2 twin sets at a time. So, we need to calculate the number of twin sets and king sets separately.

- 4 twin beds require 4 twin sets, but the laundry machine can only wash 2 twin sets at a time. So, Greg needs to wash 4 / 2 = 2 twin sets twice a week.
- 1 king set per week

Total loads per week = 2 (twin sets) * 2 (times) + 1 (king set) = 5 loads

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the total loads per week by 52 to get the total loads per year.

Total loads per year = 5 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 260 loads/year

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and multiply it by 4.

They watch 4 movies on Saturday. 
They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

To find the total number of movies they watch in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of movies they watch in one weekend by 4:
6 * 4 = 24

"To find the total number of stickers Leo has now, we need to calculate the number of stickers he collected this year and add it to the total number of stickers he had last year.

Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers. 
This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, so he collected 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

The total number of stickers Leo had last year was 100 (initial stickers) + 50 (stickers collected last year) = 150 stickers.

This year, Leo collected 100 stickers, so the total number of stickers he has now is 150 (stickers last year) + 100 (stickers this year) = 250 stickers.

The final answer is: 250"
"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount of cat food each cat eats per day (60 grams * 2, since they eat twice a day).

First, let's calculate the total amount of cat food each cat eats per day: 60 grams * 2 = 120 grams.

Now, let's divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount each cat eats per day (120 grams): 720 / 120 = 6.

So, the cat food will last for 6 days.

The final answer is: 6"

1. Becky ate 10 slices.
2. Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake did, so Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.
3. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake did, so Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.
4. To find the total number of slices eaten, add the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia: 10 + 7 + 14 = 31.

"Let's denote the time Donovan took as 'x'. Since Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, the time Betsy took is 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken by both of them is 98 minutes, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 18) = 98.

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98.

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Since x is Donovan's time, and Betsy's time is x + 18, Betsy's time is 40 + 18 = 58.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The cost of the 30-minute visit is $300/hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of 30 painkillers at $4/pill is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of parking is $6/hour for a minimum of 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add the costs together:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The final answer is: $482"
"To find out how many emails James responds to, we first need to find out how many emails he doesn't respond to. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the rest. The rest of the emails are 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Now, we need to find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week. 

Since James responds to 64 emails per day, in a 5-day work week, he responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the total number of classes that visited:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 207

The average score is 95."
"To find the total number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team, and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 
They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 (by the glee club) + 32 (by the football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 (by the glee club) + 40 (by the football team) = 60 pizzas.

The number of pizzas left is 60 (total pizzas) - 46 (pizzas eaten) = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 = 3500 cents.

He also wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, which is 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons together: 3500 + 21000 = 23500 cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert 23500 cents to dollars by dividing by 100: 23500 / 100 = 235 dollars.

The final answer is: $235"
"To find out how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered, we need to subtract 3 from 10. 

10 - 3 = 7

Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.

"To find the total cost of the butter, we need to calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter with the promotion.

Since Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion is buy one pound of butter get one half off, which means that for every 2 pounds of butter, he will pay the full price of 1 pound. 

So, for 6 pounds of butter, he will pay for 3 pounds at the full price and 3 pounds at half the price.

The cost of 3 pounds at the full price is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00.

The cost of 3 pounds at half the price is 3 * ($4.00 / 2) = 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.

The total cost of 6 pounds of butter is $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat each day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. 

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are 3 monkeys in total, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats.

We know that the total number of bananas is 315, and they last for a week, which is 7 days. So, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315.

The total number of bananas eaten in a day is 315 / 7 = 45.

Since the first and second monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day, the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day is 45 - 24 = 21.

"To find out how much Jenny paid for the roses, we need to calculate the cost of 15 roses. 

Since roses cost $2 each, 15 roses will cost 15 * $2 = $30. 

However, the florist also offers a dozen roses for $15. Since 12 roses are in a dozen, we can calculate the cost per rose as $15 / 12 = $1.25 per rose. 

Since 15 roses is more than a dozen, we should calculate the cost of 12 roses as $15 and the cost of the remaining 3 roses as 3 * $1.25 = $3.75. 

So the total cost of 15 roses is $15 + $3.75 = $18.75.

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she paid with: $25 - $18.75 = $6.25.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the change to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so we can convert $6.25 to quarters by multiplying it by 4: $6.25 * 4 = 25 quarters.

Jenny leaves with 25 quarters."

"To find the time Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time interval between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's arrival.

1. The first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes.
2. The first train will stay in the station for 20 minutes. So, the first train will leave the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.
3. The second train will arrive half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after the first train's arrival.
4. The second train will stay in the station for a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed in the station, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train will leave the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.
5. The third train will arrive an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after the first train's arrival.
6. The third train will leave the station immediately after it arrives, so it will leave at 125 minutes.
7. The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after the first train's arrival.

Now, we need to find the time Paul will wait for his train. Since the first train arrives at 10 minutes, we need to find the time difference between 10 minutes and 145 minutes.

The time Paul will wait for his train is 145 - 10 = 135 minutes.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and then the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is:

2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so the price his friend paid is:

1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price his friend paid, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100:

Discount = ((2000 - 1800) / 2000) * 100

First, let's find the time it took him to walk to the store. The distance to the store is 4 miles, and his speed is 4 miles per hour. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

Since he walked to the store and then back home, we need to double the time to account for the return trip.

Total Time = 2 * Time
Total Time = 2 * 1 hour

"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet. 

Since they have 100 feet of fence in total, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To find the total earnings, we need to find the number of each type of bike sold and multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's find the total earnings for each type of bike:

- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add the earnings from each type of bike to find the total earnings:

"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we need to calculate the total minutes for the extra classes and the regular classes.

The regular classes are 6 periods a day, and each period is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes for regular classes in a day is 6 * 40 = 240 minutes.

John has 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long, so the total minutes for extra classes in a day is 2 * 40 = 80 minutes.

The total minutes for classes in a day is 240 + 80 = 320 minutes.

Since John goes to class for 5 days a week, the total minutes for classes in a week is 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes.

Now, we need to calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday. John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time. 

First, we need to find the total minutes in a week. There are 7 days in a week, and each day has 24 hours, and each hour has 60 minutes. So, the total minutes in a week is 7 * 24 * 60 = 10080 minutes.

John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time, so the extra learning time is 10080 * (1/16) = 630 minutes.

The total minutes John spends learning in a week is the sum of the minutes for classes and the extra learning time, which is 1600 + 630 = 2230 minutes.

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, the total hours John spends learning in a week is 2230 / 60 = 37.17 hours.

"To find the height of the fourth child in inches, we need to convert the height of the first child to inches and then calculate the height of the fourth child.

1 foot is equal to 12 inches. 

The first child is 6 feet tall. 
6 feet * 12 inches/foot = 72 inches

The second child is two inches taller than the first child. 
72 inches + 2 inches = 74 inches

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child. 
74 inches - 5 inches = 69 inches

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child. 
69 inches + 3 inches = 72 inches

The height of the fourth child is 72 inches."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by 10 to find the number of bags.

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which is half of what was left after the velociraptors ate. So, the velociraptors ate half of the remaining meat, which means the Allosaurus ate half of that half, or 1/4 of the original amount.

2. Since the Allosaurus ate 1/4 of the original amount, and they ate 270 kilograms, we can set up the equation: 1/4 * x = 270, where x is the original amount of meat.

3. To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate x: x = 270 * 4.

4. x = 1080.

So, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

The final answer is: 1080"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then divide it by the area covered by a gallon of paint to find out how many gallons are needed. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet. 
The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet. 
The total area of the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the remaining number of shaken and unshaken sodas after Ellen's brother took some.

Initially, there were 3 shaken sodas and 9 unshaken sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving:

- 2 shaken sodas
- 7 unshaken sodas

Ellen's friend will choose a soda randomly from the remaining 9 sodas (2 shaken + 7 unshaken). The probability of choosing a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas:

Probability = Number of shaken sodas / Total number of sodas
Probability = 2 / 9

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:

Probability = (2 / 9) * 100
Probability ≈ 22.22%

The final answer is: 22.22"
"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to find the total distance each train has traveled and add them together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

The total distance between the two trains is the sum of the distances they have traveled, which is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of days Billy works, we first need to find the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

Now, we subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy works.
50 - 10 = 40

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so we need to find the total number of hours he works in a day.
2 people/hour * 3 hours = 6 people/day

Now, we multiply the number of days Billy works by the number of people he can help per day.
40 days * 6 people/day = 240 people

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people that were present.

First, let's calculate the total number of people that were transported by the buses:
12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people that were transported by the cars:
20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the number of people transported from the total number of people present. However, the question does not provide the total number of people present. It only provides the number of private cars and buses. We can assume that the number of people present is equal to the number of people transported (i.e., 480 people) since the question does not provide any other information.

However, if we assume that the number of people present is equal to the number of people transported, then the number of people inside the church would be 0.

But if we assume that the number of people present is greater than the number of people transported, then the number of people inside the church would be the difference between the number of people present and the number of people transported.

Since we do not have the total number of people present, we cannot provide a definitive answer. However, we can provide a range of possible answers.

If we assume that the number of people present is equal to the number of people transported, then the number of people inside the church is 0.

If we assume that the number of people present is greater than the number of people transported, then the number of people inside the church is greater than 0.

However, if we assume that the number of people present is equal to the number of people transported plus some unknown number of people, then the number of people inside the church would be equal to that unknown number of people.

Since we cannot provide a definitive answer, we will provide the number of people transported as the answer.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike.
3. Mike is 24 years old.

From point 2, we can find Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age:
Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

From point 1, we can find Jeff's age by adding 10 to Martha's age:
Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of each slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time = 3 minutes

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the two slides:
Difference = Time for the biggest slide - Time for the second biggest slide
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference = 2 minutes

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. 
Total time spent per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 2 x 15 minutes (breaks) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. 
To find the total time spent over 5 days, we multiply the daily time by 5:
1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total miles run by all three is 52. We can subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Total miles = 52
Amber's miles = 8
Micah's miles = 28
Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the returns and the discounts.

Initially, Sheila charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card. She returned one item that cost $15.00, so the new balance is:

$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

She then bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we need to calculate 20% of $20.00:

20% of $20.00 = 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

The cost of the frying pan after the discount is:

$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we need to calculate 10% of $30.00:

10% of $30.00 = 0.10 x $30.00 = $3.00

The cost of the towels after the discount is:

$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

The total cost of the items she purchased is:

$16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

The new balance on her credit card is:

$70.00 (initial balance) + $43.00 (new purchases) = $113.00

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's break down the information given:

- A fifth of the jellyfish are large.
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
- The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue.
- When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, so we can set up the equation x/15 = 6.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15:
x = 6 * 15
x = 90

"To find Caroline's age, we need to first find Ben's age, and then multiply it by 3.

Since Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, we can find Ben's age by multiplying Chris's age by 2:
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3:
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for her retirement. 

First, let's calculate her annual expenses in retirement: 
40% of $100,000 = 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

Since she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, the total amount she needs to save is:
$40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

Now, let's calculate how much she saves per year. 
20% of $100,000 = 0.2 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

To find out how many years she needs to work to save $800,000, we can use the formula:
Number of years = Total amount / Annual savings
Number of years = $800,000 / $20,000
Number of years = 40

However, this is the number of years she needs to work to save the total amount, but we need to consider the retirement period as well. Since she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, we need to add this to the number of years she needs to work.

Total years = Number of years to save + Retirement period
Total years = 40 + 20
Total years = 60

"To find the total population of the school, we need to use the information given about the boys. Since 40% of the school population is 240 boys, we can set up the following equation:

40% of x = 240

To find x, we need to convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.4x = 240

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total population of the school is 600.

Since 40% of the school population is boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we can multiply the total population by 0.6 (60% as a decimal):

Number of girls = 0.6 * 600
Number of girls = 360

The final answer is: 360"

"To find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to find out how many days she has in June. June has 30 days.

Since Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can divide 9,300 by 30 to find out how many miles she needs to hike per day.

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Soledad is planning to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 250 miles per day. 

To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract 250 from 310.

"To find the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers, we need to calculate the production rate of each group and then add them together.

2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, so their combined production rate is 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour.
2 workers produce 4 toys an hour, so their combined production rate is 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour.
The total production rate of the first 4 workers is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since they work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, and the total order is 400 toys. This means that the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys.

The fifth worker works for 10 hours, so the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour is 180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. This means Luis received half of Seth's stickers, and Seth was left with half of his stickers.
2. Luis used half of the stickers he received and gave the rest to Kris. This means Kris received half of the stickers Luis received, which is a quarter of Seth's stickers.
3. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. This means Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers, which is a quarter of Seth's stickers.

Let's denote the number of stickers Seth had in the beginning as x. Since Kris had a quarter of Seth's stickers, we can set up the equation:

16 = x/4

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 4:

x = 16 * 4
x = 64

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

"To find the total number of M&M's, we need to first find the total weight of M&M's in ounces and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce.

Total weight of M&M's = 3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces

Since 1 ounce has 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's = 30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Now, to find the number of small bags, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag.

Number of small bags = Total number of M&M's / M&M's per small bag = 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Liam's current age as L and Vince's current age as V.

We are given that Liam is 16 years old now, so L = 16.

Two years ago, Liam's age was L - 2 = 16 - 2 = 14.

We are also given that two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince, so we can write the equation:

L - 2 = 2(V - 2)

Substituting L = 16 into the equation, we get:

14 = 2(V - 2)

Expanding the equation, we get:

14 = 2V - 4

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get:

18 = 2V

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:

V = 9

So, Vince is 9 years old now.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

We know that A = M (since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs).

We also know that C + S = 30 (since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs).

Additionally, we know that C = S + 12 (since Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah).

We can substitute the expression for C from the third equation into the second equation:

S + 12 + S = 30

Combine like terms:

2S + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:

2S = 18

Divide both sides by 2:

S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:

C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we can also find A:

A = M = 13 (since A + M = 56 - (C + S) = 56 - 30 = 26, and A = M, so A + M = 2A = 26, A = 13)

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold:

C - A = 21 - 13 = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to first find the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes separately.

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and Nik has 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces and Nik has 200 crayons, he will need 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

The total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 200 + 200 = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to calculate 80% of 80 feet. 

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet, we need to divide the total feet by 4 to find the number of logs.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks, so we multiply the number of logs by 5.

16 * 5 = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 * 1.2 = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is 1/2 of what her brother earns. 
   So, her brother's salary is 2 * 5000 = $10,000 per month.

2. Their mother earns twice their combined salary. 
   Combined salary of Valerie and her brother = 5000 + 10,000 = $15,000.
   So, their mother's salary is 2 * 15,000 = $30,000 per month.

3. To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to add their individual salaries.
   Total amount = Valerie's salary + brother's salary + mother's salary
   Total amount = 5000 + 10,000 + 30,000
   Total amount = $40,000

The final answer is: $40,000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, for a total of 3 miles.
2. Let's denote Grandma's speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute, since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk.
3. The time spent on the beach is 40 minutes, so the distance covered on the beach is 2 miles. We can use the formula: distance = speed * time. So, 2 = x * 40. Solving for x, we get x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.
4. Now that we know Grandma's speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.
5. The time spent on the sidewalk is 1 mile / (1/10 miles per minute) = 10 minutes.
6. The total time spent walking is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk: 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is:
$4 * 8 = $32

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60:
$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take:
$28 / $4 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree.

3 trees had 7 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 3 x 7 = 21.

2 trees had 4 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 2 x 4 = 8.

1 tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the number of blue birds in all the trees: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's denote the number of marbles Bob has as 'x'. 

If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 24. So, the equation becomes x + 24 = 60.

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation:

x + 24 - 24 = 60 - 24
x = 36

Now that we know Bob has 36 marbles, if he loses 10 marbles, we can find the number of marbles he will have left by subtracting 10 from 36:

36 - 10 = 26

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle. 

Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the temperatures of the two mugs. 

Since the average temperature of the two mugs is the total temperature of the water in the bottle, we can set up the equation:

(33 + x) / 2 = (33 + 4 + x - 1) / 2

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(33 + x) = (32 + x + 3)

Combine like terms:

33 + x = 35 + x

Subtract x from both sides:

33 = 35

This is a contradiction, which means that the equation is not true. However, we can try to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle by assuming that the temperature of the second bottle is just enough to make the average temperature of the two mugs equal to 40 degrees.

Let's set up the equation:

(33 + x) / 2 = 40

Multiply both sides by 2:

33 + x = 80

Subtract 33 from both sides:

x = 47

The final answer is: 47"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows

Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
= 470 cows + 230 chickens
= 700 animals

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the original price. 

Original price of 1 pack = $10.00
Number of packs ordered = 4
Total original price = 10 * 4 = $40.00

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of the total original price and subtract it from the total original price.

Discount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.1 * 40 = $4.00
Discounted price = Total original price - Discount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Now, we need to find the total number of bagels in 4 packs.

Number of bagels in 1 pack = 9
Number of packs = 4
Total number of bagels = 9 * 4 = 36

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the discounted price by the total number of bagels.

Cost per bagel = Discounted price / Total number of bagels = $36.00 / 36 = $1.00

The final answer is: $1.00"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
   Let's represent the number of scoops Gomer ate as x. Then, we have the equation: x = 23 - 5
   x = 18

2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
   Let's represent the number of potatoes needed for 1 scoop as y. Then, we have the equation: y = 6 - 3
   y = 3

3. Now, we need to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate. Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes, we can find the number of potatoes Gomer ate by multiplying the number of scoops he ate by the number of potatoes needed for 1 scoop.
   Number of potatoes Gomer ate = 18 * 3
   Number of potatoes Gomer ate = 54

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. 
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total number of eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.
240 eggs / 12 = 20 dozens

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to find the total number of red jellybeans. We know that there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans. 

So, the number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34.

We know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We already know the number of green and red jellybeans, so we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the number of green and red jellybeans from the total.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
= 60 - (17 + 34)
= 60 - 51

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

Given that the ratio of men to women is 5:9, the total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 9 = 14. 

The fraction of the total number of passengers that are women is 9/14. 

We can set up the equation: (9/14) * total_passengers = number_of_women
(9/14) * 84 = number_of_women
number_of_women = (9/14) * 84
number_of_women = 54

Now, we need to find the number of women who remained on the bus after 20 women alight. 

number_of_women_remaining = number_of_women - 20
number_of_women_remaining = 54 - 20
number_of_women_remaining = 34

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Faraday earns $26 from the sunflowers per day. Since each sunflower costs $2, the number of sunflowers sold per day is 26 / 2 = 13.

2. Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers and costs $8. Faraday earns $56 from the bouquets per day. To find the number of bouquets sold per day, we divide 56 by 8, which equals 7.

3. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets is 7 * 12 = 84.

4. The total number of sunflowers sold per day is the sum of sunflowers sold from individual sales and bouquets, which is 13 + 84 = 97.

5. To find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days, we multiply the daily sales by 3: 97 * 3 = 291.

"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference between the two.

First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with $100. 

Cost per rock = $5
Total money = $100
Number of rocks = Total money / Cost per rock
Number of rocks = 100 / 5
Number of rocks = 20

Now, let's find out how much money Adam gets from selling 60% of the rocks.

Number of rocks sold = 60% of 20
Number of rocks sold = 0.6 * 20
Number of rocks sold = 12

Revenue per rock = $7
Total revenue = Number of rocks sold * Revenue per rock
Total revenue = 12 * 7
Total revenue = $84

Now, let's find the cost of the rocks.

Cost per rock = $5
Total cost = Number of rocks * Cost per rock
Total cost = 20 * 5
Total cost = $100

Now, let's find the loss.

Loss = Total cost - Total revenue
Loss = 100 - 84
Loss = $16

"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children.

Since Chatty prepared three dozen eggs, we first need to convert the dozen to a numerical value. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so three dozen eggs would be 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs (36) by the number of children (4):

36 ÷ 4 = 9

Each child receives 9 eggs."
"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total cost of food for one day and then multiply it by the number of days in May.

There are 31 days in May. Each fish needs $1 worth of food a day. Since Jen has 3 fish, the total cost of food for one day is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

The final answer is: $93"

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

The probability of the first ticket winning is 20% or 0.2. 
The probability of the second ticket winning is three times more likely, so it's 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

The probability of both tickets winning is 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. 
   Let's denote the number of seashells Carlos collected as C. Then, Jim collected C + 5 seashells.
   Since Jim collected 27 seashells, we can write the equation: C + 5 = 27.
   Solving for C, we get C = 22.

2. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. 
   Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as x. Then, Carlos collected 2x seashells.
   We already know that Carlos collected 22 seashells, so we can write the equation: 2x = 22.
   Solving for x, we get x = 11.

Now we know that Carrey collected 11 seashells, Carlos collected 22 seashells, and Jim collected 27 seashells.

They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. 
The total number of seashells is 11 + 22 + 27 = 60.
To find out how many seashells each person got, we divide the total number of seashells by 3 (the number of people):
60 / 3 = 20

"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). 
So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. 
So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to get the total number of carrots he eats in a week.
Total carrots eaten in a week = 20 (weekdays) + 10 (weekend) = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to find the length of the second song first. 

The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (which is the decimal form of 60%).

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we have the lengths of both songs: 5 minutes for the first song and 8 minutes for the second song. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the profit from each device and then multiply it by the total number of devices sold.

The cost price of one device is $20.
The selling price of one device is twice the cost price, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

The profit from one device is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $40 - $20 = $20.

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, so the total number of devices sold is 2 + 4 = 6.

The total profit is the profit from one device multiplied by the total number of devices sold, which is $20 * 6 = $120.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of one person. 

Since each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, Hortex would need 100% / 20% = 5 bottles.

Now, to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, Hortex would need 5 bottles/person * 2300 people = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can currently produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the current production from the required production: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

The final answer is: 7300"

Number of babies wearing blue: 1/4 * 8 = 2

Number of babies wearing bows: 
- Number of blue babies wearing bows: 2
- Number of purple babies wearing bows: 1/3 * 6 = 2

Total number of babies wearing bows = 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4

Now, we need to find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This is the number of purple babies wearing bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, multiplied by 100.

Percentage chance = (2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - (Reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Reports received on Thursday and Friday)

"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. 

Next, he sold 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters.

The remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $60 from the third sale. 

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

"To find the total number of eggs found by each person, we need to follow the given information:

- Lamar finds 5 eggs.
- Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
- Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
- Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs found by all the people: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we need to convert the dozen to a numerical value: 1 dozen = 12 eggs, so 3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to find the number of apartments in the last complex. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so together they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. 
The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400. 
60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 
So the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments. 
Now we add the number of apartments in all three complexes: 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments. 
John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects from 1440 * 3 = 4320 apartments per week. 
He gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment, so he makes 4320 * 0.40 = $1728 per week.

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as x. Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the yellow rope is x + 7.

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so its length is 4x.

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 7) + 4x = 37

Combine like terms:

6x + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides:

6x = 30

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:

Length of the red rope = 4x = 4(5) = 20

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume Ronnie was given x dollars initially. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3x dollars.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Ronnie is left with x - y dollars and Rissa is left with 3x - y dollars, where y is the amount they each gave to their little sister.

We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

3x - y = (4/5)(3x)

To solve for y, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

15x - 5y = 12x

Now, we can isolate y by subtracting 12x from both sides:

15x - 12x - 5y = 12x - 12x
3x - 5y = 0

Now, we can add 5y to both sides:

3x = 5y

Now, we can divide both sides by 5:

(3/5)x = y

Now, we can substitute this expression for y into the equation for Ronnie's remaining money:

x - y = x - (3/5)x
x - (3/5)x = x - (3/5)x
(2/5)x = x - (3/5)x
(2/5)x = (2/5)x

Now, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

2x = 2x

This equation is true for all values of x, but we can't find a specific value for x. However, we can express the amount of money Ronnie has left in terms of x:

x - (3/5)x = (2/5)x

Since we can't find a specific value for x, we can express the amount of money Ronnie has left in terms of x.

However, we can find the amount of money Ronnie has left in terms of the amount Rissa has left. We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

3x - y = (4/5)(3x)

We can simplify this equation to get:

3x - y = (12/5)x

We can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

15x - 5y = 12x

Now, we can isolate y by subtracting 12x from both sides:

15x - 12x - 5y = 12x - 12x
3x - 5y = 0

Now, we can add 5y to both sides:

3x = 5y

Now, we can divide both sides by 5:

(3/5)x = y

Now, we can substitute this expression for y into the equation for Ronnie's remaining money:

x - y = x - (3/5)x
x - (3/5)x = x - (3/5)x
(2/5)x = x - (3/5)x
(2/5)x = (2/5)x

Now, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

2x = 2x

This equation is true for all values of x, but we can't find a specific value for x. However, we can express the amount of money Ronnie has left in terms of x.

However, we can find the amount of money Ronnie has left in terms of the amount Rissa has left. We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

3x - y = (4/5)(3x)

We can simplify this equation to get:

3x - y = (12/5)x

We can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

15x - 5y = 12x

Now, we can isolate y by subtracting 12x from both sides:

15x - 12x - 5y = 12x - 12x
3x - 5y = 0

Now, we can add 5y to both sides:

3x = 5y

Now, we can divide both sides by 5:

(3/5)x = y

Now, we can substitute this expression for y into the equation for Rissa's remaining money:

(4/5)(3x) = 3x - y
(12/5)x = 3x - (3/5)x
(12/5)x = (6/5)x

Now, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

12x = 6x

Now, we can subtract 6x from both sides:

12x - 6x = 6x - 6x
6x = 0

Now, we can divide both sides by 6:

x = 0

However, this is not possible since x is the amount of money Ronnie was given. We can try another approach.

Let's say Rissa has R dollars left. We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

R = (4/5)(3x)

We can simplify this equation to get:

R = (12/5)x

We are also given that Rissa gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, so we can set up the equation:

R = 3x - y

Now, we can substitute the expression for R into this equation:

(12/5)x = 3x - y

Now, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

12x = 15x - 5y

Now, we can isolate y by subtracting 15x from both sides:

12x - 15x - 5y = 15x - 15x
-3x - 5y = 0

Now, we can add 5y to both sides:

-3x = 5y

Now, we can divide both sides by 5:

(-3/5)x = y

Now, we can substitute this expression for y into the equation for Ronnie's remaining money:

x - y = x - (-3/5)x
x + (3/5)x = x
(8/5)x = x

Let's say Rissa has R dollars left. We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

R = (4/5)(3x)

We can simplify this equation to get:

R = (12/5)x

We are also given that Rissa gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, so we can set up the equation:

"Let's break down the information given:

- There are 4 colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow.
- There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
- Half the mural is yellow.
- The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is the remaining 3 colors combined (red, white, and purple). Let's represent the amount of paint used for each of these 3 colors as x. 

The total amount of paint used for the 3 colors (red, white, and purple) is 3x. Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of paint used for yellow is also 6x (since 12 pints is the total and 6x is half of 12).

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so we can set up the equation: 3x + 6x = 12

Combine like terms: 9x = 12

Divide both sides by 9: x = 12/9
x = 4/3

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, the amount of red paint used is x, which is 4/3 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{4}{3}}$"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to find the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. 
Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

The total area of the house is the sum of the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

On Wednesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she counts double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds for each day:

"To find out how many pods are in the new box, we need to calculate 20% of 100 and add it to 100. 

20% of 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20
New number of pods = 100 + 20 = 120

Now, we know that the new box costs $12 and has 120 pods. To find out how many cycles we can run for $1, we need to divide the number of pods by the cost of the box and then divide the result by the cost per cycle.

Cost per cycle = $12 / 120 = $0.1 per cycle

Now, we can divide the cost of $1 by the cost per cycle to find out how many cycles we can run for $1.

Number of cycles = $1 / $0.1 = 10

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of bills is 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which means he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is $20, he triples the number of bills, which is 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now $20, he has 60 * 20 = 1200 dollars. To convert this to 5 dollar bills, we divide 1200 by 5, which is 240.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. 

Now, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to determine how much chalk is left after Monday and then calculate how many days it will last at the 20% usage rate.

The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of it. 

First, we need to find 45% of 5 inches:
45% of 5 = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

So, the teacher used 2.25 inches of chalk on Monday. To find out how much chalk is left, we subtract this from the original 5 inches:
5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches

Now, we need to find out how many days the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk will last at the 20% usage rate.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. Then, 20% of 2.75 inches will be used each day. We can set up the equation:
0.20 * 2.75 * x = 2.75

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.20 * 2.75:
x = 2.75 / (0.20 * 2.75)
x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

"To solve this problem, we need to find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute. 

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, which is equivalent to 2/(15/60) = 4/3 snowballs per hour. 

The net rate at which Jay is building snowballs is 1/3 - 4/3 = -1 snowball per hour. 

Since Jay is losing snowballs, we need to find the time it takes for him to have 60 snowballs. Let's assume it takes x hours to have 60 snowballs. 

The number of snowballs Jay has after x hours is 20x - 4x/3 = 60. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 20x - 4x/3 = 60. 

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get 60x - 4x = 180. 

Combining like terms, we get 56x = 180.

We are given that John's current age is 28. Therefore, J1 + 20 = 28.

Now, we can solve for J1: J1 = 28 - 20 = 8.

Since J1 = 2 * J2, we can substitute J1 with 8: 8 = 2 * J2.

Now, we can solve for J2: J2 = 8 / 2 = 4.

Total hours worked in April: 45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Total earnings from hourly rate: 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen had complete attendance for the month, she will receive an additional $10 for each day. 
Total days in April: 4 weeks * 7 days/week = 28 days
Total attendance bonus: 28 days * $10/day = $280

Total earnings: $270 (hourly rate) + $280 (attendance bonus) = $550

"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we need to add up the number of people who entered at each time.

First, 50 people entered in the morning. 
Then, 40 more people entered at 10:00. 
Next, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. 
Finally, 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (50) entered by evening, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, let's add up the number of people who entered at each time: 
50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (lunch) + 150 (evening) = 320

"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and the number of black pens.

Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

She bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. So, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

The total number of pens Alain has is the sum of red and black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the total cost, we first need to find the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately.

The cost of 10 bottles of scotch is $600. 

To find the cost per bottle of scotch, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: 
$600 / 10 = $60 per bottle of scotch.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of cognac is 50% more than the cost of scotch. 50% of $60 is $30, so the cost of cognac per bottle is $60 + $30 = $90.

The total cost of cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the sum of the cost of scotch and cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Day 1:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, so he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

Day 2:
- He planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, so he planted 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees.
- He planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, so he planted 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.

Total number of White Oak trees planted in two days: 20 + 30 = 50
Total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted in two days: 40 + 50 = 90

Total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days: 50 + 90 = 140"
"To find the amount of root beer available for each person to drink, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after all the incidents.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were stolen by his children, so the remaining amount is:
24 - 4 = 20 gallons

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so the remaining amount is:
20 - 7 = 13 gallons

On the third day, 5 gallons were taken by Ronnie, so the remaining amount is:
13 - 5 = 8 gallons

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the remaining root beer equally. To find the amount each person got, we divide the remaining amount by 3:

"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as 'x'. 

The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be translated into the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for 'x':

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

"Amy initially had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes. 

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one palette, so Amy lost 4 colors. Now, Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 colors. Now, Amy has 18 - 3 = 15 colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy has 22 colors from the palettes and 15 colors from the makeup sets, so she has 22 + 15 = 37 eyeshadow colors left.

Weight of the first tuna = 56 kilograms
Weight of the second tuna = 46 kilograms
Weight of the last tuna = 26 kilograms

Total weight of the tunas = 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we need to multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Total weight of the tunas * Cost per kilogram

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed on each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. 
The medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters per day.
The high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters per day.

Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, so the total amount of water removed on the low setting is 3 * 1 = 3 liters.
He ran it for 3 days on the medium setting, so the total amount of water removed on the medium setting is 3 * 2 = 6 liters.
He ran it for 5 days on the high setting, so the total amount of water removed on the high setting is 5 * 4 = 20 liters.

The total amount of water removed is 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

"To find the total amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the total interest he owes. 

The interest is 2% of the principal amount, which is $300. 
Interest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he will pay in the first 11 months is:
Total paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275.

The remaining amount, including the interest, will be paid in the twelfth month. This is the sum of the principal amount and the interest:
Remaining amount = Principal + Interest = $300 + $6 = $306.

However, Stephen has already paid $275 in the first 11 months, so the amount he will pay in the twelfth month is the remaining amount minus the amount already paid:
Amount paid in the twelfth month = Remaining amount - Total paid in 11 months = $306 - $275 = $31.

"To find the volume of the jar, we need to multiply the area of the base by the height. The area of the base is 6 * 6 = 36 square inches. The height is 15 inches. So, the volume of the jar is 36 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume used by the jelly beans is 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so the total number of jelly beans is 432 / 0.15 = 2880.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans is 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

However, the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to know his guess. Since we don't know his guess, we can calculate the percentage difference between his guess and the true number of red jelly beans.

Let's assume Tim's guess is x. The percentage difference is ((x - 900) / 900) * 100.

However, since we don't know the exact guess, we can't calculate the exact percentage difference. But we can express the difference as (x - 900).

To find the difference, we need to know the actual number of jelly beans in the jar, which is 2880. Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans is 864. We know the true number of red jelly beans is 900, so the difference is 900 - 864 = 36.

Since the number of red jelly beans is 864, and the true number is 900, the difference is 36."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the bus had 20 people.
2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.
3. At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop (40) entered the bus. 
   3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30.
   So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.
4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. 
   The current number of people on the bus is 90. 
   Doubling this number gives 90 * 2 = 180.

Now, the bus has 180 people. The capacity of the bus is 200. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity:
200 - 180 = 20

Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we can find out how much seasoning he needs. He adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat.

Total pounds of meat needed = 5
Seasoning per pound = 2 tablespoons

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound

We also know that each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. So the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since the total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, we can write:

C + B = 10

Substituting the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the standard lessons and the reduced-rate lessons separately and then add them together.

For the standard lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. 
Total earnings from standard lessons = 4 * $80 = $320

For the reduced-rate lessons, Charlie has 2 lessons at a 25% discount from his standard rate. 
First, we need to find the reduced rate: 
Reduced rate = $80 - (25% of $80)

60 - 24 = 36

Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. 

25% of 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. 

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. 

27 * 3 = 81

The final answer is: 81"
"To find the number of novels Regina wrote this year, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. 

Let x be the number of novels Regina wrote this year. 

Since 9 novels is 3 quarters of the number of novels she wrote this year, we can write the equation as:

9 = (3/4)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4/3:

x = 9 * (4/3)
x = 12

So, Regina wrote 12 novels this year.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the distance covered by Michael in 3 days, we need to calculate the total time he traveled and multiply it by his average speed.

First, let's convert the time from days to hours:
3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance covered:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hr
Distance = 3600 km

Now, we can find the percentage of the distance covered:
Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100
Percentage = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.
3. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.
4. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.
5. The total number of grapes used by all three is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.
6. Since we want to find the initial number of grapes, we need to add the grapes used by all three to the number of grapes left. However, we don't know the number of grapes left. Let's call the initial number of grapes 'x'. The number of grapes left is x - 84.
7. Since their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, the number of grapes left must be a multiple of 12 (since each pie requires 12 grapes). So, x - 84 = 12k, where k is an integer.
8. However, we can simplify the problem by considering that the number of grapes left must be at least 0 (since you can't have a negative number of grapes). So, x - 84 ≥ 0.
9. Solving the inequality x - 84 ≥ 0, we get x ≥ 84.
10. Since x must be a multiple of 12 (because the number of grapes left is a multiple of 12), the smallest possible value of x is 84 + 12 = 96.

However, we can also consider the case where the number of grapes left is exactly 0. In this case, x - 84 = 0, so x = 84.

Therefore, the initial number of grapes is at least 84.

The final answer is: 96"
"To find the number of teachers at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of sick teachers = 13

"To find the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to calculate the cost of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese.

The cost of the pasta is $1.00 per box.

The cost of the cheddar cheese is $3.00.

The cost of the gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

The total cost of the macaroni and cheese is the sum of the costs of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese: $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the total cost per year is the cost per week multiplied by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year.

The total cost per year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520.00"
"To find the total number of minutes the custodian works in a day, we multiply the number of hours by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day

The total number of minutes the custodian needs to clean all classrooms is the product of the number of classrooms and the minutes per classroom.

80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we divide the total minutes spent cleaning by the total minutes worked in a day, and then multiply by 100.

(1200 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100 = 250%

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms on average."
"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we need to determine the total capacity of each bookcase and divide the total number of books by this capacity.

Each middle shelf can hold 10 books. 
The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.
The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

The total capacity of one bookcase is 10 + 20 + 15 = 45 books.

Now, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 110 / 45 = 2.44.

Since Elly can't have a fraction of a bookcase, she needs to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all her books fit. 

2.44 rounded up to the nearest whole number is 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total cost of the eggs, we need to multiply the cost per dozen by the number of dozens. 

Cost per dozen = $2.40
Number of dozens = 5
Total cost = Cost per dozen * Number of dozens
Total cost = $2.40 * 5
Total cost = $12

To find the total number of eggs, we multiply the number of dozens by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs).

Number of dozens = 5
Total number of eggs = Number of dozens * 12
Total number of eggs = 5 * 12
Total number of eggs = 60

Now, we need to find the total revenue from selling the eggs. We know that Rose sells 3 eggs for $1.

Revenue per 3 eggs = $1
To find the revenue per egg, we divide the revenue per 3 eggs by 3.

Revenue per egg = Revenue per 3 eggs / 3
Revenue per egg = $1 / 3
Revenue per egg = $0.33

Now, we can find the total revenue by multiplying the revenue per egg by the total number of eggs.

Total revenue = Revenue per egg * Total number of eggs
Total revenue = $0.33 * 60
Total revenue = $20

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. We are given that B = 5S - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so S + B = 116.

Substituting B = 5S - 4 into the second equation, we get S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know S = 20, we can find B by substituting S into the equation B = 5S - 4: B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's find the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 is 4, so 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each.

The number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.
The number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Total gallons = 4 + 1 = 5 gallons

Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, the total amount of lemon juice needed is 5 cups.

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we need to find out how many lemons are needed for 5 cups of juice.

Number of lemons per cup = 6 lemons / 1 cup = 6 lemons/cup

Total lemons needed = 5 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 30 lemons

However, the extra gallon for Allen needs to be twice as tart as the other gallons. This means it needs to have twice the amount of lemon juice. 

Extra lemon juice needed = 2 * 1 cup = 2 cups

1% is equal to 0.01. Multiply 1600 by 0.01 to find the force needed: 
1600 * 0.01 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total length of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the backyard fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width.

Given that the length (l) is 20 feet and the width (w) is 15 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(20) + 2(15)
P = 40 + 30
P = 70

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to go around the entire fence.

The final answer is: 70"

"To find out how much feed is left, we need to calculate how much feed the pigs eat in a day and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so each pig eats 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of feed per day.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total amount of feed they eat per day is 5 * 8 = 40 pounds.

In a week, the pigs eat 40 * 7 = 280 pounds of feed.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so to find out how much is left, we subtract the amount eaten from the total amount ordered: 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

"To find out how many hot dogs John needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party. 

Number of guests: 20
Number of hot dogs per guest: 2
Total hot dogs required: 20 * 2 = 40

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over, so we subtract those from the total required:
Total hot dogs required: 40 - 4 = 36

Since each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, we need to find out how many packs John needs to buy. 

To do this, we divide the total hot dogs required by the number of hot dogs per pack:
36 / 6 = 6

Since John needs 6 packs of hot dogs, and each pack costs $2, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:
6 * 2 = 12

For the T-shirts, Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a buy one get one 50% off deal. This means that one T-shirt is at full price and the other is 50% off. 

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. 
The full-priced T-shirt costs $8.
The discounted T-shirt costs 50% off of $8, which is 0.5 * $8 = $4.
So, the total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

For the shoes, the original price is $40 and they are 40% off. 
The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 * $40 = $16.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many holes the dog digs in total and then subtract the number of holes filled by Nate from the total number of holes.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84.

Since the dog digs 6 new holes every night, we need to add these to the total number of holes. However, we don't know how many days Nate takes to fill the holes, so we can't directly calculate the number of nights. 

Let's assume it takes x weeks for Nate to fill the holes. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days is 7x.

In x weeks, the dog digs 6 * x holes at night. 

The total number of holes is 84 + 6x.

Nate fills 9 holes a day, so in 7x days, he fills 9 * 7x = 63x holes.

Since the total number of holes is equal to the number of holes filled by Nate, we can set up the equation:

84 + 6x = 63x

Subtracting 6x from both sides gives us:

84 = 57x

Dividing both sides by 57 gives us:

x = 84 / 57
x = 1.4737

Since x represents the number of weeks, we round up to the nearest whole number because we can't have a fraction of a week. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of weeks it takes to fill the holes, and we can't fill a fraction of a hole. 

So, we need to find the number of days it takes to fill the holes and then convert it to weeks. 

The number of days it takes to fill the holes is 7x = 7 * 1.4737 = 10.3209 days.

Since we can't fill a fraction of a hole, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of days. However, we are looking for the number of weeks, so we can round up to the nearest whole number of days and then convert it to weeks.

Rounding up to the nearest whole number of days gives us 11 days. 

11 days is equal to 1.57 weeks. However, we are looking for the number of weeks it takes to fill the holes, and we can't fill a fraction of a hole. 

So, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of weeks. However, in this case, we can't fill a fraction of a hole, but we can fill a fraction of a week.

2. Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron.
3. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
4. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

From point 2, we know that Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa did, so Aaron ran 4 / 2 = 2 miles.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, it will take Vanessa twice as long to run the same distance. Therefore, if Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, Vanessa would run 2 miles in 2 * 16 = 32 minutes.

However, Vanessa ran 4 miles, not 2. Since it takes Vanessa 32 minutes to run 2 miles, it will take her 2 * 32 = 64 minutes to run 4 miles.

"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write the equation:

2C + 4W = 70

We can solve the first equation for W:

W = 20 - C

Now, substitute this expression for W into the second equation:

2C + 4(20 - C) = 70

Expand the equation:

2C + 80 - 4C = 70
