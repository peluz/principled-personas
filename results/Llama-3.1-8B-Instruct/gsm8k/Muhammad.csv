"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

Now, let's subtract the number of eggs she uses from the total number of eggs she lays: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. To find out how much she makes, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg: 9 * 2 = 18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we have:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber together:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we need to first find the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

Let's find the value of the repairs in terms of the original value of the house. If the original value is 100%, then the value after repairs is 150%. 

The increase in value is 150% - 100% = 50% of the original value. 

50% of $80,000 is 0.5 * $80,000 = $40,000. 

So, the value of the repairs is $40,000. 

The total value of the house after repairs is the original value plus the value of the repairs: $80,000 + $40,000 = $120,000.

Josh sold the house for $120,000. He bought the house for $80,000 and put in $50,000 in repairs. 

The profit Josh made is the selling price minus the cost: $120,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $120,000 - $130,000 = -$10,000.

However, since Josh can't make a negative profit, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The problem states that the repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. This means the value of the repairs is 150% of the original value, not 50%. 

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000. 

The value of the repairs is $120,000 - $80,000 = $40,000. 

The total value of the house after repairs is the original value plus the value of the repairs: $80,000 + $40,000 = $120,000.

Josh sold the house for $120,000. He bought the house for $80,000 and put in $40,000 in repairs. 

The profit Josh made is the selling price minus the cost: $120,000 - ($80,000 + $40,000) = $120,000 - $120,000 = $0.

The final answer is: $0"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he does in a week.

James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James does this 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to find out the total number of cups of feed she gives to her chickens in a day. 

In the morning, she gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens 25 cups of feed. So, the total number of cups of feed she gives in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since she gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in a day is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, we subtract the total number of cups of feed she gives in the morning and afternoon from the total number of cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in a day to find out how many cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day. 

60 - 40 = 20

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The remaining glasses are 16 - 1 = 15 glasses. 
Every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * 5 = $3. 

The cost of the remaining 15 glasses is 15 * 3 = $45. 
The total cost is the cost of the first glass plus the cost of the remaining glasses: 5 + 45 = $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together: 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to calculate the time taken for the first part of the download, the time taken for the restart, and the time taken for the second part of the download.

First, let's find the time taken for the first part of the download. Carla can download 2 GB/minute. The file is 200 GB, so the time taken for the first part of the download is:

Time = Total size / Download speed
Time = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 100 minutes

40% of the file is 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB. Carla has already downloaded 80 GB in 100 minutes. 

Now, let's find the time taken for the second part of the download. The remaining size of the file is 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB. The time taken for the second part of the download is:

Time = Total size / Download speed
Time = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 60 minutes

The time taken for the restart is given as 20 minutes.

The total time taken to download the file is the sum of the time taken for the first part of the download, the time taken for the restart, and the time taken for the second part of the download:

Total time = 100 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes
Total time = 180 minutes

The final answer is: 180"
"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled in the first 3 hours and the distance he traveled in the last 4 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time

For the first 3 hours, John drove at 60 mph:
Distance = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

For the first 2 hours of the return trip, John was stuck in traffic, so he didn't move:
Distance = 0 miles

For the next half-hour, John drove at 30 mph:
Distance = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

For the remaining 2.5 hours of the return trip, John drove at 80 mph:
Distance = 80 * 2.5 = 200 miles

Now, let's calculate the total distance John traveled:
Total Distance = 180 + 0 + 15 + 200 = 395 miles

However, since John is trying to get home, we need to find the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours. To do this, we need to subtract the distance he traveled in the first 3 hours from the total distance he traveled:
Distance from home = Total Distance - Distance traveled in the first 3 hours
Distance from home = 395 - 180
Distance from home = 215 miles

"To find Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately, then add them together.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime pay rate is:
$10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

Her overtime earnings are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings for the week are:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month, so we need to calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 
30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"

"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total revenue it generates each year.

The initial cost of the tree is $90. 

Each year, the tree generates revenue from selling lemons. Since the tree grows 7 lemons per year and each lemon sells for $1.5, the total revenue per year is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

However, it also costs $3 to water and feed the tree each year. So, the net revenue per year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

To find out how many years it will take for the tree to start earning money, we need to find the break-even point, which is when the total revenue equals the initial cost of the tree.

Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. The total revenue after 'x' years is $7.5x, and the total cost is $90. We want to find the smallest 'x' for which $7.5x ≥ $90.

Dividing both sides by $7.5, we get x ≥ $90 / $7.5.

x ≥ 12

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, it will take 13 years for the tree to start earning money.

The final answer is: 13"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with ""x"". So, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.

2. After selling at the green house, she had (x - x/3) = (2x/3) vacuum cleaners left.

3. Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, she had (2x/3 - 2) vacuum cleaners left.

4. After that, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of (2x/3 - 2) is (1/2)(2x/3 - 2) = (x/3 - 1).

5. So, she had (2x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 1)) = (x/3 - 1) vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house.

6. We are given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5.

7. To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation: x/3 = 6.

8. Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for x: x = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students

The remaining students after contemporary dance are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

The remaining students after jazz dance are 16 - 4 = 12 students.

The rest of the students, which is 12, enrolled in hip-hop dance.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To maximize profit, the merchant should choose the item that will increase in value the most. 

First, calculate the increase in value for each item:

Jewelry: 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125
Electronic gadgets: 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96

Since $125 is greater than $96, the merchant should choose the jewelry. 

The profit will be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. 

On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance.

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles.

"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in 4 weeks and then multiply it by the number of eggs she eats per day.

There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will have 4 x 7 = 28 days.

Claire eats 3 eggs per day, so in 28 days, she will eat 28 x 3 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat.

84 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 7 dozens.

"To find the total time Marissa wants to take to complete the 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

time = 12 miles / 4 mph = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles, she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance.

The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can use the formula: speed = distance / time.

speed = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 mph

"To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. 

Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the remaining one-third is non-water. So, the non-water part is 10 - 6.67 = 3.33 liters.

Now, to find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, we calculate three-fifths of 15 liters.

Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Since we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of the orange drink. The remaining amount of the orange drink is 10 - 1 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the remaining orange drink to the pineapple drink to get the total amount of the mixture. The total amount is 9 + 15 = 24 liters.

The total amount of water in the mixture is the sum of the water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink. The water in the orange drink is 6.67 liters, and the water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters. So, the total water is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15.67}$"

"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought a total of 3 DVDs.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought a total of 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

So, Billy sold 7 DVDs to the first 5 customers. The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so we don't need to add anything to the total.

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours.

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price.

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since Kyle bought the book with a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of the original price, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so we can set up the equation:

x - 0.25x = 19.50

Combine like terms:

0.75x = 19.50

Now, divide both sides by 0.75 to solve for x:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

Cost of milk: 5 packs * $3 = $15
Cost of apples: 4 apples * $1.50 = $6
Total cost of chicken, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Now, we need to subtract the total cost of the chicken, milk, and apples from the total amount Marie paid to find the cost of the pizza boxes.

Cost of pizza boxes: $50 - $33 = $17

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can divide the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box to find the number of boxes.

Number of boxes of pizza: $17 / $8.50 = 2

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 cartons of ice cream for 60 days (1 serving per night for 60 nights).

Each carton has 15 servings, so to find the total number of cartons she needs, we divide the total number of days by the number of servings per carton:

60 days / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the total number of cartons by the cost per carton:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 from 60. 

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance of the first stop and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

20 miles (first stop) - 45 miles (distance from second stop to the end) is not correct, we need to find the distance from the first stop to the second stop. 

Since the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance of the first stop and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

The distance from the first stop to the second stop is 20 miles (first stop) + 15 miles (distance from the second stop to the end) = 35 miles.

However, we need to find the distance between the first and second stop, not the distance from the first stop to the second stop. 

The correct way to find the distance between the first and second stop is to subtract the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip from the distance of the first stop, and then subtract the result from the distance of the first stop. 

However, the correct way to find the distance between the first and second stop is to find the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and subtract the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip from it. 

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles (total distance) - 20 miles (distance of the first stop) = 40 miles.

Now, we can find the distance between the first and second stop by subtracting the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip.

Distance between the first and second stop = 40 miles - 15 miles = 25 miles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x, where x is a constant.

Since their total age now is 162, we can set up the equation:

Combine like terms:
18x = 162
Divide both sides by 18:
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages:
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We are given that G = S + 30. We also know that the total number of coins is 110, so S + G = 110.

Substituting G = S + 30 into the second equation, we get S + (S + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2S = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30: G = 40 + 30 = 70.

"To find out how much money John made from selling his Lego sets, we need to multiply the number of Lego sets by the price per set. 

13 Lego sets * $15 per set = $195

John then bought 8 video games for $20 each, so we need to multiply the number of video games by the price per game.

8 video games * $20 per game = $160

Since John had $5 left after buying the video games, we need to subtract the cost of the video games from the total amount he made from selling his Lego sets.

$195 - $160 = $35

However, this is the amount of money John had left after buying the video games, not the amount he made from selling his Lego sets. To find out how much he made from selling his Lego sets, we need to add the $5 he had left to the cost of the video games.

$160 + $5 = $165

Now, we know that John made $165 from selling his Lego sets. To find out how many Lego sets he sold, we need to divide the total amount he made by the price per set.

$165 / $15 per set = 11

Since John started with 13 Lego sets, we need to subtract the number of sets he sold from the total number of sets he had.

13 - 11 = 2

John still has 2 Lego sets."
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his total running time and then divide the total distance by the total time.

John runs 3 hours the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

Total running time = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours

Since John runs 3 days a week, we need to multiply the total running time by 3 to get the total weekly running time.
Total weekly running time = 6 hours * 3 = 18 hours

Now, we can calculate John's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.
Speed = Total distance / Total time = 60 miles / 18 hours = 3.33 miles per hour

The final answer is: 3.33"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out Dana's walking speed first. Since she can skip at half the speed of running and she skips at 3 miles per hour, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours she spends walking and running. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, in 6 hours, she spends 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours running and 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.

The distance she covers while running is 6 * 2 = 12 miles, and the distance she covers while walking is 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles.

The total distance she can travel in six hours is 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

The final answer is: 18"

"To find the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone, we need to multiply the original distance by 3. 

Original distance = 400 feet
Distance with gemstone = 400 * 3 = 1200 feet

Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1000 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the javelin. However, we need to find the distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames. 

Distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames = 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces. 

First, let's find the total number of pieces. Since Grandma Jones cut each pie into 8 pieces and she baked 5 pies, the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40.

Now, let's subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces to find out how many pieces were taken by the guests. 
40 - 14 = 26

"To find out how many calories you can still consume, subtract the calories you've already consumed from your daily target: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, multiply the number of servings you can still consume by the total weight of the bag: 0.8 * 300 = 240 grams.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total cost. Since Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for 10 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks for 20 candles. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is $10.00. 

Next, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles. The total revenue is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Now, let's find the net profit. The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. The total cost is $10.00, and the total revenue is $40.00. 

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $10.00
Net profit = $30.00

The final answer is: $30.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Total articles written in 3 days = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since it takes 4 hours to write one article, the total hours spent writing articles = 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to first determine how many Post-it notes she had after placing one on each of the 220 cups of coffee. 

She started with 80 Post-it notes. After placing one on each of the 220 cups, she would have 80 - 220 = -140 Post-it notes left. However, we know that she actually had 23 Post-it notes remaining. This means that the -140 is incorrect, and we need to add the 23 Post-it notes to the 80 she started with to get the total number of Post-it notes she had after placing one on each of the 220 cups of coffee. 

80 + 23 = 103. 

Now, we need to find out how many Post-it notes were in the package she purchased. We know that she placed 220 Post-it notes on the cups of coffee, and she had 103 Post-it notes after placing them. This means that the package she purchased had 220 + 103 = 323 Post-it notes.

The final answer is: 323"
"To find out how much John spent on ties, we first need to determine the number of blue ties and the cost of red ties.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie.

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:
Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is:
Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties:
Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:
Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so:

First, let's find out how many eggs are produced per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since eggs are sold in dozens, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total amount Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

"To find the total time Tom spent traveling, we need to calculate the time he spent going and coming back. 

First, let's find the time he spent going from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels from 1 to 4 PM, that's a 3-hour period. However, we need to find the distance he traveled in that time. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, we know the distance is 30 miles and his speed is 10 miles per hour. To find the time it took him to travel this distance, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 10 miles/hour
Time = 3 hours

So, it took him 3 hours to travel from 1 to 4 PM.

Now, let's find the time he spent traveling back. We know the distance is the same (30 miles) and his speed is 6 miles per hour. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it took him 5 hours to travel back.

The total time he spent traveling is 3 hours (going) + 5 hours (coming back) = 8 hours.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the total weight of the comic books he removed. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removed 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books already removed weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, to find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

"To find the revenue earned on Thursday, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately and then add them together. 

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday = 6 * $60 = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday = 4 * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

To find the revenue earned on Friday, we need to calculate the revenue from car tires only since no truck tires were repaired.

Revenue from car tires on Friday = 12 * $40 = $480

Now, we need to compare the revenues earned on Thursday and Friday to find the day with higher revenue. 

Thursday's revenue: $520
Friday's revenue: $480

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 

Now, we need to find the difference in revenue between the two days.

Difference in revenue = Thursday's revenue - Friday's revenue
= $520 - $480
= $40

"To find out how much water the girls got, we need to calculate 1/6 of 24 liters. 

1/6 of 24 liters = (1/6) * 24 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, they got a total of 2 * 4 = 8 liters.

Now, we subtract the total amount of water the girls got and the boy got from the initial 24 liters to find out how much water is left.

24 - 8 - 6 = 10 liters

"To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he had initially and then subtract the stickers he gave away and used.

Initially, Charlie had 10 stickers.

He bought 21 stickers from a store, so now he has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.

He got 23 stickers for his birthday, so now he has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.

He gave 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.

He used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

Therefore, Charlie has 17 stickers left.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find Alex's weight, we need to calculate 4 times what Grace weighs and then subtract 2 pounds from that result. 

4 times what Grace weighs is 4 * 125 = 500 pounds. 
Alex weighs 2 pounds less than that, so Alex weighs 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

The final answer is: 623"
"To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose.

Number of rose bushes: 3
Number of roses per bush: 25
Number of thorns per rose: 8

First, multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 * 25 = 75

The total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's denote the number of games the team lost as L and the number of games they won as W. We know that W = L + 8 and the total number of games played is 22, so L + W = 22.

We can substitute W from the first equation into the second equation: L + (L + 8) = 22.

Combine like terms: 2L + 8 = 22.

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2L = 14.

Divide both sides by 2: L = 7.

Now that we know L, we can find W: W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time it went off and add them together.

The first time it went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to first calculate her salary after 5 years of service, and then calculate the increase for the next 3 years.

Initial salary: $600
Increase after 5 years: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 5 years: $600 + $60 = $660

Now, we need to calculate the increase for the next 3 years. Since the increase is 10% of the current salary, we will apply the increase to the salary after 5 years.

Increase after 6 years: 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 6 years: $660 + $66 = $726

Increase after 7 years: 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 7 years: $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Increase after 8 years: 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 8 years: $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Increase after 9 years: 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.85
Salary after 9 years: $878.46 + $87.85 = $966.31

We know that the total number of copies sold is 88,000, so we can set up the equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

Number of invited guests = 16
Number of guests who don't show up = 1/4 * 16 = 4
Number of guests who will attend = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we can multiply the number of guests who will attend by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

Number of gift bags needed = 12 * 0.75 = 9

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag.

Cost per gift bag = $2
Total cost = 9 * $2 = $18

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount eaten by adults and children separately and then add them together.

Adults will eat 20 * 10 = 200 pounds of potato salad.

Children will eat half as much as adults, so they will eat 5 * (10 / 2) = 5 * 5 = 25 pounds of potato salad.

The total amount of potato salad needed is 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
2. There are two cats for every dog.
3. The number of dogs is 60.

Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120.

The combined number of dogs and cats is 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180.

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so the number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168.

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348.

The final answer is: 348"

"Let's break down the information given:

- Total cars originally on the motorway = 30
- 5 cars took an exit, so the remaining cars that drove through the traffic jam = 30 - 5 = 25
- Total cars that drove through the traffic jam = cars in the first 15 minutes + cars in the remaining 15 minutes
- Cars in the remaining 15 minutes = 20

Let's represent the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. 
So, the equation becomes: x + 20 = 25

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.

"To find the inner volume of one box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the dimensions of the box and then multiply the resulting dimensions.

The length of the inner box is 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side)
The width of the inner box is 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side)
The height of the inner box is 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side)

Now, we multiply the dimensions to find the inner volume of one box:
Inner volume = length * width * height = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. This means she stamps 1/3 * 60 = 20 letters.
2. After stamping 20 letters, the number of letters needing stamps is 60 - 20 = 40.
3. We are given that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.
4. Since Jennie stamped 20 letters, the number of letters in the already-stamped pile before she started is 30 - 20 = 10.

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons while making the stew.
4. After using the spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as 'x'. 

From point 2, we know that Julia had 'x' spoons initially. 
From point 3, we know that after using 3 spoons, she had 'x - 3' spoons left.
From point 4, we know that after her husband gave her 5 more spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons. 

So, we can set up the equation: x - 3 + 5 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages.

Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 
He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages: 38 + 44 = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we need to find out how many friends Amy has and then add it to Lily's friends.

Lily made 50 friends. Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, so Amy made 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

Now, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have together: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to find the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity.

The cost of each pepper is given as $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of each watermelon is 3 * 15 = $45.

An orange costs 5 dollars less than what a watermelon costs, so the cost of each orange is 45 - 5 = $40.

Now, we can find the total cost of each item by multiplying the cost by the quantity:

- Total cost of watermelons: 4 * 45 = $180
- Total cost of peppers: 20 * 15 = $300
- Total cost of oranges: 10 * 40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of the total cost of each item: 180 + 300 + 400 = $880

The final answer is: $880"
"To find the total time spent by doctors, we need to multiply the number of patients by the average time each patient is seen. 

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total minutes to hours.

12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The hospital pays the doctors $150/hour, so the total cost is:

200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

The hospital charges the patients $200/hour, so the total revenue is:

200 hours * $200/hour = $40000

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

$40000 - $30000 = $10000

The hospital makes $10000 in profit from these visits."
"To find the number of elves left, we first need to find out how many elves quit after the children vomit on them. A third of the 60 elves quit, so we divide 60 by 3.

60 / 3 = 20 elves quit after the children vomit on them.

Now, we subtract the elves who quit from the total number of elves to find the remaining elves.

60 - 20 = 40 elves left after the children vomit on them.

Then, 10 more elves quit after kids kick their shins. We subtract these 10 elves from the remaining 40 elves.

40 - 10 = 30 elves left.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total expenditure for May and June, we need to add the expenditure for both months.

The expenditure in May was $500. 
The expenditure in June was $60 less than May, so it was $500 - $60 = $440.

Now, let's add the expenditure for both months: $500 + $440 = $940.

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides each person took and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she rode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides is 4 (Pam's rides) + 6 (Fred's rides) = 10 rides.

Each ride costs 6 tickets, so the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first determine how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is 6 * 4 = 24 miles.

Now, we know that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We already know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. 

So, the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles. 

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday: 41 - 28 = 13 miles.

"To find out how much Tom pays in a year, we need to first calculate how much he pays in a month. 

Tom gets 4 car washes a month and each car wash costs $15. 

So, the total amount Tom pays in a month is: 4 car washes * $15/car wash = $60/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 to find the yearly cost: 

$60/month * 12 months/year = $720/year

The final answer is: $720"
"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we first need to determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially has 20 video games but lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. To find out how many video games Bobby has, we multiply Brian's remaining video games by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 times Brian's remaining video games is 3 * 15 = 45.

5 fewer than 45 is 45 - 5 = 40.

"To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed in both tests and subtract that from the total number of questions in both tests.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 
Time taken to complete the first test = Total questions / Rate per hour = 75 / 5 = 15 hours. 
Since Mark only had 8 hours, he completed 8 / 15 of the first test. 
Number of questions completed in the first test = (8 / 15) * 75 = 40.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 
Time taken to complete the second test = Total questions / Rate per hour = 100 / 5 = 20 hours. 
Since Mark only had 6 hours, he completed 6 / 20 of the second test. 
Number of questions completed in the second test = (6 / 20) * 100 = 30.

Total questions completed in both tests = 40 + 30 = 70.

Total questions in both tests = 75 + 100 = 175.

Number of questions left incomplete = Total questions in both tests - Total questions completed in both tests = 175 - 70 = 105.

"To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we need to subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Total number of cars = 20
Number of automatic cars = 12
Number of manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100

"Let's break down the information given:

- Let the number of baby bees be x.
- Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2x.
- There are twice as many babies as queens, so the number of queens is x/2.
- The total number of bees is 700, which is the sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens. So, we can write the equation: x + 2x + x/2 = 700.

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + 4x + x = 1400.

Combine like terms: 7x = 1400.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 200.

Since the number of worker bees is 2x, we can find the number of worker bees by multiplying x by 2: 2 * 200 = 400.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day, if he spent that time working instead, he would work 2 hours a day.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours he would work in a week is 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week.

Jordan earns $10 an hour, so his total earnings in a week would be 14 hours/week * $10/hour = $140/week.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of food items and non-food items separately and then add them together.

Food items: 
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
Total cost of food items: 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
Total cost of non-food items: 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
Tax = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of non-food items:
Total cost of non-food items with tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax:
Total cost = 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

"To find the total number of clients, we need to add the clients Kim already has to the potential clients he is talking to. 

Total clients = 3 (existing clients) + 5 (potential clients) = 8 clients

Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bleach bottles per week = 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths per week = 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week = 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week = 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week = $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Since the total income per week is $92, the profit per week will be the difference between the total income and the total expenses.

Profit per week = Total income - Total expenses
Profit per week = $92 - $72
Profit per week = $20

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to first find out how many pineapples he has in total. 

John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field and there are 100 pineapples per hectare. So, the total number of pineapples John has is:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods are in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:
12 months / 3 months = 4 periods

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples by the number of periods to find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year:
1000 pineapples * 4 periods = 4000 pineapples

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left return, which is 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees.
3. So, after 12 hours, there are 30 - 15 = 15 bees that haven't returned yet.
4. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 leave the hive, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
5. Now, we have a total of 15 (initial bees that left and haven't returned) + 60 (new bees that left) = 75 bees that haven't returned yet.
6. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before that (15) return to the hive.

So, the number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 15.

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and add the change she received.

The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12 and the cost of 1 child ticket is $10. 

Total cost = cost of adult ticket + cost of child ticket
Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we need to add this to the total cost to find out how much she gave the cashier.

Total given = Total cost + Change
Total given = $22 + $8
Total given = $30

"Let's break down the information given:

- Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy.
- James has four times as many friends as Dorothy.
- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook.

Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can represent the number of Dorothy's friends as x. This means Charlie has 3x friends.

We know Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation: 3x = 12

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 12 / 3
x = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find the number of James' friends. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so James has 4 * 4 = 16 friends.

"To find out who wins the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

Steve's distance is 3 miles, which is 5280 feet (since 1 mile = 5280 feet). His speed is 440 feet per minute. 

Time taken by Steve = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Steve = 5280 / 440
Time taken by Steve = 12 minutes

Tim's distance is 2 miles, which is 10560 feet (since 1 mile = 5280 feet). His speed is 264 feet per minute.

Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Tim = 10560 / 264
Time taken by Tim = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 12 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will be the winner. 

To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the time taken by the winner from the time taken by the loser.

Time waited by the winner = Time taken by the loser - Time taken by the winner
Time waited by the winner = 40 - 12
Time waited by the winner = 28 minutes

For the bicycles, each bike has 2 tires, and 5 people came by, so the total number of tires is 5 * 2 = 10. Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total cost for the bicycles is 10 * 25 = 250 cents. 

For the tricycles, each tricycle has 3 tires, and 3 people came by, so the total number of tires is 3 * 3 = 9. Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total cost for the tricycles is 9 * 25 = 225 cents.

For the unicycle, it has 1 tire, and 1 person came by, so the total number of tires is 1 * 1 = 1. Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total cost for the unicycle is 1 * 25 = 25 cents.

Now, we add the total costs together: 250 + 225 + 25 = 500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 500 / 100 = 5.

2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total number of fries eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
   Now, the total number of fries eaten by Dave, the seagull, and the pigeons is 21 + 9 = 30.
4. A raccoon ate two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's call the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it 'x'. 
   After the pigeons ate, the remaining fries are x - 30. 
   The raccoon ate two-thirds of this, which is (2/3) * (x - 30).
   The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (x - 30) - (2/3) * (x - 30).
   Simplifying this, we get (1/3) * (x - 30).
5. After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. 
   So, the remaining fries after the raccoon ate are 5.
   Setting this equal to (1/3) * (x - 30), we get:
   (1/3) * (x - 30) = 5
   Multiplying both sides by 3, we get:
   x - 30 = 15
   Adding 30 to both sides, we get:

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together:

1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches

Since we want the total length in feet, we need to convert the total length from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

Total bananas needed per month = 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

Since the zookeeper needs to order bananas for 2 months, we multiply the total number of bananas needed per month by 2.

Total bananas needed for 2 months = 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he's running back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then add them together.

The cost of one action figure is $5.
The cost of one red car is $4.

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, the cost of the doll is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of toy:
- 5 red cars: 5 * $4 = $20
- 3 action figures: 3 * $5 = $15
- 1 doll: $15

The total worth of all the toys is $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself:

Income lost = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the income she'll lose:

Difference = Income lost - Cost of accountant
= $105 - $90
= $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

The final answer is: $15"

Elvira will have €177 left for her clothing."
"To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job. 

First, we need to find out how many eggs Sandra needs in total. Since she needs 3 eggs per Spanish flan and she's making 15, she needs 3 * 15 = 45 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job: 45 / 9 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We are given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation:

S = 2B

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, we can write another equation:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the second equation, we get:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to first calculate twice the amount of money Ethel has. 

Ethel has $8, so twice that amount is 2 * 8 = 16.

Since Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has, we add $2 to the result. 

16 + 2 = 18.

Jimmy has $18."
"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks in a week. 

There are 7 days in a week. Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, he walks 20 * 5 = 100 miles from Monday to Friday. 

On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, he walks 10 * 2 = 20 miles on the weekends.

Now, let's add the miles he walks from Monday to Friday and the miles he walks on the weekends. 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hat is $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times as much as the hat, so it is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost of the pants is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

The final answer is: $150"

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
2. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
3. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo.
4. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.

From point 3, we know Sally Four is 8 years old. 
From point 2, we know Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.
From point 1, we know Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of three birds: Sally Four (8), Granny Red (16), and Sally Two (19). 
The only bird left is Sally, but we don't have any information about her age. However, since the question asks for the total age of the four birds, we can assume Sally is also a Sally, and her age is not specified. 

Since we don't have the age of Sally, we can't calculate the total age of the four birds. However, we can calculate the total age of the three birds we know: 8 + 16 + 19 = 43.

Since we can't calculate the total age of the four birds, I will provide the total age of the three birds we know: 43."
"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate the total monthly payment and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the increased minimum payment for each debt:

- Student loans: $300 * 1.5 = $450
- Credit card: $200 * 1.5 = $300
- Mortgage: $500 * 1.5 = $750

Now, let's add up the increased minimum payments:
$450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

Since Jessica pays this amount each month, we multiply it by 12 to find the total annual payment:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes, then add the time it takes to cut one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)

Total time to peel all potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes
Total time to cut all potatoes: 60 potatoes * (5/60) minutes/potato = 5 minutes

Total time to peel and cut all potatoes: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

The final answer is: 95"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

2. They made a profit of $25, and their revenue per gallon is $10, so the cost per gallon is $10 - $25 = -$15 (since they made a loss of $15 per gallon). However, since cost can't be negative, we'll assume they made a profit of $25 on a certain number of gallons, and then calculate the cost per gallon.

3. Let's say they made x gallons. Then, their revenue is $10x and their cost is $3x (for lemons) + $2x (for sugar) = $5x. Since they made a profit of $25, we can set up the equation:

$10x - $5x = $25

4. Simplifying the equation, we get:

$5x = $25

5. Dividing both sides by 5, we get:

x = 5

6. Now that we know they made 5 gallons, we can calculate the total cost of lemons:

Total cost of lemons = $3x = $3 * 5 = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the number of Chinese participants, we first need to subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants. 

Total participants = 240
Japanese participants = 80
Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Now, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team was 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls on the Chinese team = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 160 - 60
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 100

The final answer is: 100"

- Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
- Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

To find the total number of crabs the three have together, we add the number of crabs each one has: 
40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122

"To find the number of votes the winner got, we need to calculate 3/4 of the total number of students who voted. 

3/4 * 80 = 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, and the winner got 60 votes, the loser must have got the remaining votes. 

Total votes - Winner's votes = Loser's votes
80 - 60 = 20

The loser got 20 votes."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. 

Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is 4x.

She also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. So, the number of white carnations (x) is equal to 200 / 5 = 40.

Now that we know the number of white carnations (x) is 40, we can find the number of red roses, which is 4x = 4 * 40 = 160.

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 2, we can write an equation: 
Mark - 2 = (1/2)Jan - 5

Since we know Jan is 30, we can substitute that value into the equation:
Mark - 2 = (1/2)(30) - 5
Mark - 2 = 15 - 5
Mark - 2 = 10
Mark = 12

Now that we know Mark is 12, we can find Jean's age using point 1:
Jean = Mark + 2
Jean = 12 + 2
Jean = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total time for the well-rounded team, we multiply the time per runner by the number of runners: 55 seconds * 4 = 220 seconds.

For the less well-rounded team, the first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we add the times of all the runners: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To find the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3, we need to count the favorable outcomes and divide it by the total number of outcomes.

The favorable outcomes for rolling a number greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes.

The total number of outcomes is 6 (since it's a six-sided die).

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to count the favorable outcomes and divide it by the total number of outcomes.

The favorable outcomes for rolling two even numbers in a row are (2,2), (2,4), (2,6), (4,2), (4,4), (4,6), (6,2), (6,4), and (6,6). There are 9 favorable outcomes.

The total number of outcomes is 6^2 = 36 (since it's a six-sided die and we're rolling it twice).

So, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 9/36 = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

Now, to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row, we need to subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.

Difference in probability = 50% - 25% = 25%

So, it is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"

"To find the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The initial amount owed is $100.
The monthly interest rate is 2% or 0.02.

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

The total interest is $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

The total amount Mandy should pay is the initial amount plus the total interest: $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

Rounded to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to first calculate the total cost and total revenue.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $400. So, we can set up the equation:

Total Revenue - Total Cost = Profit
$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:
$8x = $400

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 8:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

So, the trader sold 50 bags."
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to first find out how many minutes he collects peaches for. Since he collects peaches for 3 hours, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes per hour.

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now that we know John collects peaches for 180 minutes, and he can collect 2 peaches per minute, we multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks need per day, we first need to find out how many pounds they need per week and then divide that by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The flock of ducks needs 3.5 pounds of insects per duck per week. Since there are 10 ducks, the total amount of insects needed per week is 3.5 * 10 = 35 pounds.

Now, we divide the total amount of insects needed per week by 7 to find out how many pounds they need per day: 35 / 7 = 5 pounds.

"To find the total number of trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees over 10 years, then subtract the trees that die.

Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net change in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8.

Over 10 years, the net change is 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

Tom starts with 50 trees, so after 10 years, he has 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 * 0.3 = 39.

So, the number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find the number of pink and white flamingos, we need to break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, the number of white flamingos is 6.

The number of pink flamingos left is 18 - 6 = 12.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is now 12 + 18 = 30.

The number of white flamingos remains the same, which is 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

"To find out how many crayons Violetta can buy, we need to divide the amount of money she has by the cost of one crayon. 

Number of crayons = Total money / Cost of one crayon
Number of crayons = $20 / $2
Number of crayons = 10

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color.

Total number of crayons she can buy = 2 * 5
Total number of crayons she can buy = 10

Since she can buy 10 crayons in total and she needs 5 different colors, she will have 5 crayons left over.

Change = Total money - (Cost of crayons she bought)
Change = $20 - (2 * 10)
Change = $20 - $20
Change = $0

However, since she can buy 10 crayons and she only needs 5 different colors, she will have 5 extra crayons. The cost of these extra crayons will be 5 * $2 = $10. 

Change = Total money - (Cost of crayons she bought)
Change = $20 - (2 * 10)
Change = $20 - $20
Change = $0

However, since she can buy 10 crayons and she only needs 5 different colors, she will have 5 extra crayons. The cost of these extra crayons will be 5 * $2 = $10. 

Change = Total money - (Cost of all crayons)
Change = $20 - $10
Change = $10

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots used = 2 pounds/restaurant * 40 restaurants
Total pounds of carrots used = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total pounds of carrots used from the total pounds of carrots available.

Total pounds of carrots available = 200 pounds
Total pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds of carrots available - Total pounds of carrots used
Total pounds of carrots not used = 200 pounds - 80 pounds
Total pounds of carrots not used = 120 pounds

3. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he also edits 1000 sentences for Publisher B.
4. Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 2 * 5 cents = 10 cents per sentence.
5. The total amount Mark makes from Publisher A is 1000 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 5000 cents.
6. The total amount Mark makes from Publisher B is 1000 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 10000 cents.
7. The total amount Mark makes in a week is the sum of what he makes from both publishers: 5000 cents + 10000 cents = 15000 cents.

"To find the total amount John made that year, we need to calculate his new salary after the 5% raise and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise:
5% of 2000 = 0.05 * 2000 = 100

New salary = old salary + raise = 2000 + 100 = 2100

Since John got the award on the first day of the year, he will have the new salary for all 52 weeks of the year. 

Total amount made that year = new salary * number of weeks = 2100 * 52 = 109200

However, we also need to add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to this amount.

Total amount made that year = 109200 + 5000 = 114200

"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the total number of blue and red pens she bought and add them to her initial number of pens.

Janet bought 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens.
Janet bought 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.

The total number of new pens Janet bought is 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 66 pens.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she had a total of 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply 93 by 6 to get the total score.

Total score needed = 93 * 6
Total score needed = 558

Next, we need to find the total score Brinley has so far. We add up the scores of the first five tests.

Total score so far = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86
Total score so far = 338

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, we need to find the lowest score among the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score after removing the lowest score, we subtract the lowest score from the total score so far.

Total score after removing the lowest score = Total score so far - Lowest score
Total score after removing the lowest score = 338 - 71
Total score after removing the lowest score = 267

Now, we need to find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test. We subtract the total score after removing the lowest score from the total score needed.

To find the weight of each candied apple, we need to divide the weight of a chocolate bar by 2, since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. So, the weight of each candied apple is 40 / 2 = 20g.

To find the total weight of the candied apples, we need to multiply the number of candied apples by their weight. So, the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20 = 1600g.

To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples. So, the total weight of the bag of candy is 1000 + 1600 = 2600g.

The cost of the jacket is $30, and the cost of 2 pairs of shoes is 2 * $20 = $40. 

So, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn. 

Let's calculate how much more money she needs: $70 - $10 = $60.

Now, let's calculate how much she earns from babysitting: $5 * 4 = $20.

To find out how much more she needs to earn from mowing the lawn, we subtract the amount she earns from babysitting from the total amount she needs: $60 - $20 = $40.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we need to divide the amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn by the amount she earns per mowing: $40 / $4 = 10.

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).

Given the length of the park is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5
Perimeter = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Day 1: 100 customers
- Day 2: 50 more customers than Day 1, so 100 + 50 = 150 customers
- Total customers by Day 3: 500

To find the number of customers on Day 3, we need to subtract the total customers on Day 1 and Day 2 from the total customers by Day 3.

Customers on Day 3 = Total customers by Day 3 - (Customers on Day 1 + Customers on Day 2)
= 500 - (100 + 150)
= 500 - 250
= 250

The final answer is: 250"
"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

The rate at which water is leaking from both pools is 4 gallons/minute. Since 4 minutes have passed, the total amount of water leaked from both pools is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

The current amount of water in the big pool is 2x - 16 gallons, and the current amount of water in the small pool is x - 16 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

The initial amount of water in the small pool was 24 gallons. Since 16 gallons leaked out, the current amount of water in the small pool is:

24 - 16 = 8 gallons

The final answer is: 8"

"To find the total amount Janeth will pay, we need to calculate the total interest she will pay over 12 months. 

First, let's find the interest she will pay each month. 10% of $2000 is 0.1 x $2000 = $200. 

Since she will pay $165 a month, the remaining amount she will pay as interest each month is $200 - $165 = $35.

Now, let's find the total interest she will pay over 12 months. $35 x 12 = $420.

The total amount she will pay is the initial amount plus the interest. $2000 + $420 = $2420.

Since she will pay $165 a month for 12 months, the total amount she will pay is $165 x 12 = $1980.

The remaining balance will be the total amount she will pay minus the initial amount. $2420 - $1980 = $440.

The final answer is: $440"

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age is 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years.
3. Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years.

Now, let's calculate their ages in three years:

1. Harriet's age in three years = 21 + 3 = 24 years.
2. Zack's age in three years = 42 + 3 = 45 years.
3. Adrian's age in three years = 63 + 3 = 66 years.

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:

Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored. 

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. 

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

We know that the total points scored by all four students is 251. 
We know that Naomi scored 68 points, Yuri scored 44 points, and Brianna scored 85 points. 
So, the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points. 

To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to subtract the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points scored by all four students.

"To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we need to first find the total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type and buying 14 grass type.

Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 

After losing 8 water type cards, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.

After buying 14 grass type cards, he has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

The total number of cards James has now is 30 (fire type) + 34 (grass type) + 32 (water type) = 96 cards.

The percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is (32 / 96) * 100.

32 / 96 = 0.3333333333333333

"To find out how many vines Steve needs, we first need to determine how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply this by 7 days in a week.

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can assume his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve. 

6 tomatoes/day / 2 = 3 tomatoes/day (girlfriend's consumption)

Now, we multiply the girlfriend's consumption by 7 days in a week.

3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week (girlfriend's consumption)

Total tomatoes consumed per week = Steve's consumption + girlfriend's consumption
= 42 tomatoes/week + 21 tomatoes/week
= 63 tomatoes/week

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines Steve needs, we divide the total tomatoes consumed per week by the tomatoes produced per vine.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike receives from his remaining 3 pen pals. Since each of them sends 2 letters a week, and there are 3 of them, the total number of letters he receives is 2 * 3 = 6 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of students in the school is 20 * 3 = 60.

The total number of girls in the first and second class is 15 + 12 = 27. 

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

Now, we know that the total number of girls in the school is 30, and the total number of girls in the first and second class is 27. So, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% boys, the total number of boys in the school is 60 - 30 = 30.

The first and second class have a total of 20 students, and 27 of them are girls. So, the number of boys in the first and second class is 20 - 27 = -7. However, since we cannot have a negative number of students, this means that the first and second class have fewer students than the total number of students in two classes. This is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate our previous steps.

Let's re-evaluate the total number of girls in the school. We know that the first and second class have 27 girls, and the school is 50% girls. So, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3. 

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of boys in the school is 60 - 30 = 30.

The total number of students in the first and second class is 20 * 2 = 40. The number of girls in the first and second class is 27. So, the number of boys in the first and second class is 40 - 27 = 13.

We are also told that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12 to find the number of wolves killed today. Solving for x, we get x = 4.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of wolves killed today, which is 3x = 3(4) = 12.

To find the total number of animals killed, we add the number of animals killed last night and today: 10 (wolves) + 15 (cougars) + 12 (wolves) + 12 (cougars) = 49.

The final answer is: 49"
"To find the floor Bill is on, we need to calculate 4 times his starting floor (3) plus 6.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we need to calculate 30% of 30, which is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we subtract 9 from 30 to get 30 - 9 = 21. 

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, so we multiply 21 by 4 to get 21 * 4 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

So, the number of cows added to each stall is 40 / 10 = 4 cows.

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8:

24 * 8 = 192

The final answer is: 192"
"To find the total amount of money Brady has, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill, and then add them together.

100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1
40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2
20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2
40 dollar bills = 40 x $1 = $40

Now, let's add the values together:
$1 + $2 + $2 + $40 = $45

The final answer is: $45"
"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections and then multiply it by the weight of each section. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 
200 / 10 = 20 sections

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section:
20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

Now, we need to find 30% of the total weight that the termites ate. To do this, we multiply the total weight by 0.3 (which is 30% in decimal form):
8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds

Now, we subtract the weight eaten by termites from the total weight to get the remaining weight:
8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books and add the flat fee.

The cost of the overdue books is 8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
2. Andrea has 52 apples.
3. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
4. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.
5. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.
6. To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have: 52 (Andrea's apples) + 44 (Jamal's apples) + 24 (Andrea's bananas) + 48 (Jamal's bananas) = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we first need to find out how many cups of flour are needed for 36 cookies and 30 cookies separately.

Since 1 dozen (12) cookies require 2 cups of flour, we can find out the flour needed for 1 cookie by dividing 2 cups by 12 cookies. 

2 cups / 12 cookies = 1/6 cup per cookie

Now, we can multiply the number of cookies Carla is making each day by the amount of flour needed per cookie to find out the total flour needed for each day.

For today: 36 cookies * 1/6 cup per cookie = 6 cups
For tomorrow: 30 cookies * 1/6 cup per cookie = 5 cups

Now, we add the flour needed for both days to find the total flour needed.

6 cups (today) + 5 cups (tomorrow) = 11 cups

The final answer is: 11"
"To find two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to multiply the total number of pennies by 2/3.

9,300 * (2/3) = 6,200

Then, she gets 20 marbles from her friend. 

So, the total number of marbles she has now is 250 + 20 = 270.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the number of trees in Harry's yard, we first need to find the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees, Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Then, Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. 5 more than that is 6 + 5 = 11.

To find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard: 11 - 3 = 8.

"To find the total price of the house, we need to add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price.

The brokerage fee is 5% of $350,000, which is 0.05 x $350,000 = $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of $350,000, which is 0.12 x $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

The difference between the total price and Mrs. Cruz's budget is $409,500 - $400,000 = $4,500.

"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract it from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 
Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee:
Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000

Now, let's calculate the total fees paid:
Total fees = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee = $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000

Next, let's calculate the net proceeds from selling the house before paying the loan:
Net proceeds before loan = Selling price - Total fees = $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000

Finally, let's subtract the remaining loan amount:
Net proceeds = Net proceeds before loan - Remaining loan amount = $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000

The final answer is: $118,000"
"To find the time it takes to heat up to 400 degrees, we need to calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 
So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 20 (to heat up to 300 degrees) + 28 (to heat up to 400 degrees) + 23 (to cook) = 71 minutes.

There are 2 houses with 3 bedrooms each, so the total number of bedrooms is 2 * 3 = 6. 

Each bedroom has 2 windows, so the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12.

There are 4 additional windows in each house not connected to bedrooms, so the total number of additional windows is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of windows in both houses is the sum of the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows, which is 12 + 8 = 20.

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to find the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, the total number of stitches for the body and the sleeves is 1800 - 270 = 1530 stitches.

The body takes 900 stitches, so the sleeves take 1530 - 900 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, and then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

"Let's denote Sam's current age as 'S' and Ruby's current age as 'R'. 

We are given that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write the equation: R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write the equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Now, we can substitute R = 6S into the second equation: 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Expanding the equation, we get: 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get: 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get: 3S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: S = 6.

Initially, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point and still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed:

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 3 meals in a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). So, the total rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 3 = 0.6 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total rice consumed per day is 0.6 kg * 5 = 3 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per day (3 kg).

42 kg / 3 kg/day = 14 days

Since we want to know how many weeks the rice will last, we need to convert the number of days to weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the number of days by 7.

14 days / 7 days/week = 2 weeks

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 2 weeks. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he sold bread for 5 days. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. 

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates

Since he was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 working days. His target for the week was 120 crates. 

Number of working days = 7 - 2 = 5

Target for 5 working days = 120 / 7 * 5 = 85.71 (approximately)

However, since we can't sell a fraction of a crate, we will consider the target for 5 working days as 85 crates.

Crates off from target = Target for 5 working days - Total crates sold
= 85 - 65
= 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carmen spent on bidding. 

Carmen starts with a bid of $200. The other 3 people each bid once, so the desk price increases by $50 three times. 

The total increase in price due to the other bidders is 3 * $50 = $150.

The final price of the desk is the initial bid plus the total increase, which is $200 + $150 = $350.

Carmen also bids after each of the other 3 people, so she bids 4 times (including her initial bid). 

The total amount she spent on bidding is the initial bid plus the increase in price due to her own bids, which is $200 + 3 * $50 = $200 + $150 = $350.

The total cost of the desk is the sum of the price increase due to the other bidders and the price increase due to Carmen's own bids, which is $150 + $200 = $350.

However, this is the price increase, not the total amount she spent. Since she bid 4 times, the total amount she spent is the initial bid plus the price increase due to her own bids, which is $200 + $200 = $400.

The final answer is: $400"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total miles driven, the total cost of driving, and the total bonus.

1. Total miles driven: Since John goes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 = 60 miles. 
   He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven per year is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15000 miles.

2. Total cost of driving: He gets charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of driving per year is 15000 * 2 = $30000.

3. Total bonus: He gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus per year is 150 * 12 = $1800.

4. Total cost: The total cost is the sum of the total cost of driving and the total bonus, which is 30000 + 1800 = $31800.

The final answer is: $31800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined: 39 minutes
Twice the combined time: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of pages and how they are arranged in the tabloid. 

When a piece of paper is folded, it creates two pages. The left side of the paper becomes the back of the first page and the front of the second page, and the right side of the paper becomes the back of the second page and the front of the first page. 

Since we have a 32-page tabloid, we need to find the number of pieces of paper required to create these 32 pages. 

Since each piece of paper creates 2 pages, we can divide the total number of pages by 2 to find the number of pieces of paper required. 

Number of pieces of paper = Total number of pages / 2
= 32 / 2
= 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to first calculate how much she spent on food and snacks. 

She spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is 50 / 2 = $25.

Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides. 

So, the total amount she spent is 25 + 10 = $35.

Now, to find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she had: 50 - 35 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total books = 250
- Unsold books = 50
- Books sold this year = 45
- Books sold in the first year = 2 * Books sold this year = 2 * 45 = 90
- Books sold in the second year = Total books - Unsold books - Books sold this year - Books sold in the first year
= 250 - 50 - 45 - 90
= 65

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
Total money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book
= 65 * 20
= 1300

The final answer is: $1300"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Since Watson gets a $300 bonus each week, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for April, which has 4 weeks:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April."
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to find 20% of 20, since he beat 80% of the people.

"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we first need to determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 
Two-thirds of 60 is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves. 

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. 
Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 
60 - 40 = 20 loaves are left.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. 
Half of 20 is (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of 10, which is 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how much weight Sandy loses in a week, we need to divide the total weight Joey loses in 4 weeks by 4. 

Weight lost by Joey in 4 weeks = 8 pounds
Weight lost by Joey in 1 week = 8 / 4 = 2 pounds

Since Sandy loses the same amount of weight as Joey in 4 weeks, Sandy loses 2 pounds in a week. 

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey in 4 weeks, we need to divide the total weight lost by Joey in 4 weeks by the weight lost by Sandy in a week.

Total weight lost by Joey in 4 weeks = 8 pounds
Weight lost by Sandy in a week = 2 pounds
Time taken by Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey in 4 weeks = 8 / 2 = 4 weeks

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. 
The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22. 
The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. 
The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2. 
The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

1. Calculate the cost of business suits: 6 suits * $100 = $600
2. Calculate the cost of suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 = $150
3. Calculate the cost of the flight ticket: The cost of a business suit is $100, so 5 times this amount is $500. The flight ticket costs $700 more than this, so the cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200.
4. Calculate the total cost so far: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950
5. Calculate how much Theo has left after buying these items: $6000 (initial budget) - $1950 (total cost so far) = $4050
6. Calculate how much Theo has to save: $4050 (remaining budget) - $2000 (amount to save) = $2050

1. Trent is 5 years older than Jane.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.
3. Quinn is 30 years old.

Since Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, we can find Jane's age by subtracting 3 from Quinn's age:
Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now that we know Jane's age, we can find Trent's age by adding 5 to Jane's age:
Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent's age = 27 + 5

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is D/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. We are given that the total number of players is 105. 

So, we can write the equation: D + 2D + D/2 = 105

To solve for D, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2D + 4D + D = 210

Combine like terms: 7D = 210

Divide both sides by 7: D = 30

The number of players on the defense is 30.

Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24 people

Then, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. 
24 - 8 = 16 people

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

1 (electric pole) : 3 (electric wires) = x (electric poles) : 45 (electric wires)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

1 * 45 = 3x
45 = 3x
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people at the party was 25 + 15 = 40.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. To find out how many people left, we need to calculate 1/4 of 40, which is 40 * (1/4) = 10.

So, 10 people left the party. Since 22 men stayed, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. This means that 10 - 3 = 7 women left the party.

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 left. To find out how many women are left, we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.

"Let's break down the problem. 

Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this:

3x + 2 = 26

where x is the number of pencils in each box. 

To find x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Then, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 * 8 = 24 pencils. She also has 2 loose pencils, so she has a total of 24 + 2 = 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. 

The total number of pencils they have is 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all their pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each box:

Number of boxes = Total number of pencils / Number of pencils per box
= 72 / 8

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need to find out how many ice cubes are required.

Number of ice cubes = Total cooling required / Cooling per ice cube
= 65 / 13

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. So, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which weakens the coffee. 

Total weakening = Weakening due to ice cubes + Weakening due to cream
= 60 + 15

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out the ratio of old records to new records. Since people can trade 2 old records for 1 new one, the ratio is 2:1.

Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let x be the number of new records each person gets. Since there are 5 people, the total number of new records is 5x. We know that 5x = 7.

However, this equation doesn't make sense because 5 people can't get 7 new records. Let's re-examine the problem. If 5 people leave with 7 new records, it means that the total number of new records is 7. Since the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1, for every 1 new record, there are 2 old records. So, the total number of old records is 2 times the total number of new records.

Let's set up the equation: total old records = 2 * total new records
We know that the total number of new records is 7. So, the total number of old records is 2 * 7 = 14.

However, this is the total number of old records brought in by all 5 people. To find out how many old records each person brought in, we need to divide the total number of old records by 5.

Number of old records each person brought in = total old records / 5
= 14 / 5
= 2.8

However, since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to find the number of junior programmers, the number of senior programmers, and their respective salaries.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. 
2/5 * 100 = 40 junior programmers.

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, so the total amount paid to junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so they are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

The total amount paid to senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount paid to all programmers is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

Since the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can find the time it takes to charge 40% by multiplying 40 by 3. 

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To find the net pay for Job A, we need to calculate the total income and then subtract the taxes. 

Job A's total income is $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year. 
The state tax rate is 20%, so the taxes for Job A are $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. 
The net pay for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B, we first need to subtract the property tax from the total income. 
The property tax is $6,000, so the income after property tax is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. 
The state tax rate is 10%, so the taxes for Job B are $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. 
The net pay for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs, we subtract the net pay of Job A from the net pay of Job B: 
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the shares after the first year and then after the second year.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1 + 0.5 = 1.5).
New price after the first year = $8 * 1.5 = $12.

The stock price decreases by 25% in the second year. To find the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%, or 1 - 0.25 = 0.75).
New price after the second year = $12 * 0.75 = $9.

Now, we multiply the new price after the second year by the number of shares to find the final value of Maria's shares.
Final value = 8 * $9 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"To find out how many hot dogs John ate, we first need to find out how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, Thomas ate 2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the last group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. 

So, we can write the equation: 
x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 
3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 
3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 70

Since the last group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the last group by substituting x = 70 into the expression: 
x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as CH. We know that CH = 2C (since he has twice as many chickens as cows) and C + CH = 60 (since he has 60 animals in total).

We can substitute CH with 2C in the second equation: C + 2C = 60
Combine like terms: 3C = 60
Divide both sides by 3: C = 20

Now that we know C = 20, we can find CH: CH = 2C = 2 * 20 = 40

The number of legs of a cow is 4 and the number of legs of a chicken is 2. So, the total number of legs of cows is 4 * 20 = 80 and the total number of legs of chickens is 2 * 40 = 80.

The total number of legs of all animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find out how many balls Josh is juggling at the talent show, we need to determine how many balls he was juggling before the incident and then subtract the balls that were lost.

Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. So, the total number of balls he was juggling before the incident is 3 + (1 * 4) = 7.

However, Josh drops 3 balls, but 2 of them are caught by the crowd. So, the total number of balls lost is 3 - 2 = 1.

Now, we subtract the lost balls from the total number of balls Josh was juggling before the incident: 7 - 1 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:

Weight of the pink frog = 50 pounds
Weight of the blue beetle = 50 pounds
Weight of the green toad = 50 pounds
Weight of the yellow snake = 60 pounds
Weight of the red bird = 30 pounds
Weight of the container = 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June, we first need to calculate the new daily distance he needs to run. 

The original distance Tyson runs is 5000 meters. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. 

1/5 of 5000 meters is 5000 / 5 = 1000 meters. 

So, the new daily distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since there are 30 days in June, the total distance covered in June is 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to first calculate how many cookies are used by her son and her husband.

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 cookies a week.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies a week.

In total, 20 + 7 = 27 cookies are used by her son and her husband.

Since there are 36 cookies in a bag, and 27 cookies are used by her son and her husband, Jenny eats the remaining cookies. 

36 - 27 = 9

Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find the total cost of the shirts, first, we need to find the discount amount. 

The original price of 2 shirts is 2 * $30 = $60. 
The discount is 40% of $60, which is 0.4 * $60 = $24.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the final cost: 
$60 - $24 = $36.

"To find the percentage increase, we need to first find the difference in the amount they make per day now and the amount they used to make per day.

The factory used to make $100 per tractor and sold 10 tractors a day, so they made $100 * 10 = $1000 per day.

Now, they make $220 per silo and sell 5 silos a day, so they make $220 * 5 = $1100 per day.

The difference in the amount they make per day now and the amount they used to make per day is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100:

($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

"To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the total cost per month and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the cost of food per month: 
Since food costs $25 per week and there are 4 weeks in a month, the cost of food per month is $25 * 4 = $100.

Now, let's add the cost of treats and medicine to the cost of food: 
$100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220 per month.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost per year is: 
$220 * 12 = $2640.

Andrea saved $21."
"To find the total time John spent, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then find the total. 

Time spent boating: 6 hours
Time spent swimming: 6 / 2 = 3 hours
Time spent watching shows: 3 shows * 2 hours per show = 6 hours
Total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours

Since the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time, we can set up the equation: 
30% * Total time = 6 hours
0.30 * Total time = 6 hours
Total time = 6 / 0.30
Total time = 20 hours

Now, we know that John spent 40% of his time sightseeing.

"To find the height of the tallest tree, we first need to find the height of the second tree. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, which is 6 feet. 

Height of the second tree = Height of the shortest tree + 5 feet
Height of the second tree = 6 + 5
Height of the second tree = 11 feet

Now, we need to find the combined height of the two trees. 

Combined height of the two trees = Height of the shortest tree + Height of the second tree
Combined height of the two trees = 6 + 11
Combined height of the two trees = 17 feet

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two trees.

Height of the tallest tree = 2 * Combined height of the two trees
Height of the tallest tree = 2 * 17

"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money he spent and then subtract that from the initial amount he received.

Dean bought 6 toy cars at $2 each, so the total cost of the toy cars is 6 x $2 = $12.
He also bought 5 teddy bears at $1 each, so the total cost of the teddy bears is 5 x $1 = $5.
The total amount Dean spent is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially received $28 from his mother. After spending $17, he has $28 - $17 = $11 left.

His mother then gives him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
Since there are 'x' friends, the total cost for mini-golf for her friends will be 1 * $5 * x = $5x. 
The cost for Morgan and her friends to ride the go-karts is 2 * $10 * (x + 1) = $20x + $20, because Morgan is also riding the go-karts. 
The cost for arcade tokens is $5. 

The total cost is $5x + $20x + $20 + $5 = $25x + $25. 

The total budget is $90, so we can set up the equation $25x + $25 = $90. 

Subtracting $25 from both sides of the equation gives $25x = $65. 

Dividing both sides by $25 gives x = 2.6. 

Since you can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number.

"To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we first need to determine how much money he had left after buying the candy. 

Billy started with $10. He spent $1.5 per pound on candy. Let's call the number of pounds of candy he bought 'x'. The total cost of the candy is 1.5x. 

So, the amount of money he had left after buying the candy is 10 - 1.5x.

He then took half of this change and spent it on gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05, the total cost of the gumballs is 0.05 * (40 / 2) = 1.

This means that half of his change is 1. So, the change he had after buying the candy is 2. 

Now, we can set up the equation: 10 - 1.5x = 2 * 2

Simplifying the equation, we get: 10 - 1.5x = 4

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get: -1.5x = -6

Dividing both sides by -1.5, we get: x = 4

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. First, we add 5 to both sides:

45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5
50 = 2x

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'x':

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the three cities. 

Distance from the first city to the second city = 75 miles
Distance from the second city to the third city = 100 miles
Distance from the third city to the first city = 100 - 50 = 50 miles

Total distance in one trip = 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is:
Total distance in a day = 225 miles * 3 = 675 miles

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total distance it travels in a day (675 miles).

Number of days between services = 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days

Since the train can't travel a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of days it goes between services, so we will round down to 26.67 days."

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each picture frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors. So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of etching the logo on the picture frames. The etching costs an additional 20% of the cost of each picture frame. 20% of $20 is 0.2 * $20 = $4. So, the total cost of etching is 44 * $4 = $176.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 1/4 * 44 = 11 officers. Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12. So, the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

The original price of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

Since making it yourself saves 20%, the cost of making it yourself will be 80% of the original price. 

To find 80% of the original price, we multiply the original price by 0.8 (which is 80% in decimal form).

Materials cost = $400 * 0.8
Materials cost = $320

The total cost will be the materials cost plus the cost of the materials, which is $0 (since you're making it yourself).

Total cost = Materials cost + Cost of materials
Total cost = $320 + $0
Total cost = $320

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20. One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5.

The number of pupils who like green is 5. 

The number of pupils who like yellow is the total number of pupils minus the number of pupils who like blue and green, which is 40 - 20 - 5 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked each day.

On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples picked, but we don't know the number of apples picked. However, we know she got $56 from selling them at $4 per piece. So, the number of apples picked on Monday is 56 / 4 = 14.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the number of apples picked each day: 14 + 12 + 24 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"

"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest Karan has to pay and then divide it by the number of months.

The total interest can be calculated using the formula: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time
Here, Principal = $3,650, Rate = 10% or 0.10, Time = 5 months.

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we need to add the interest to the principal to find the total amount Karan has to pay.
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we can find the monthly payment by dividing the total amount by the number of months.
Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
Monthly Payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly Payment = $1,095

The final answer is: $1,095"

"To find the total number of pesos they have together, we need to calculate the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos each of them has, and then add them together.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. 

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 
Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos each of them has:
Axel's total: 50 (silver) + 80 (gold) = 130
Anna's total: 100 (silver) + 120 (gold) = 220

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher: 3 * 12 = 36 cups.

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is 36 * $1 = $36.

The cost of supplies is $18. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we need to find the profit per hour. To do this, we divide the profit by the number of cups sold per hour: $18 / 4 = $4.50.

The final answer is: $4.50"
"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of land as x hectares.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his land, which is equal to 12.8 hectares. We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2 to isolate x:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of female members in the choir, we first need to find 50% of 52, which is 0.5 * 52 = 26. 

Since half the people performing can't make it to the show, we need to find 50% of 26, which is 0.5 * 26 = 13. This is the number of people who can't make it to the show. 

So, the number of people who can make it to the show is 26 - 13 = 13. 

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so the total number of people who sang in the performance is 13 + 3 = 16.

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.

First, let's find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

"To find out how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of the rides for Dasha and compare it to the cost of the ride bracelet for David.

Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * $2 = $4.

Dasha buys tickets for 9 rides, so the total cost for her is 9 * $4 = $36.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.

Since they both ride all 9 rides, the cost for Dasha is $36 and the cost for David is $30.

"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to find out how many popsicles each of them has. 

Let's assume the number of popsicles Betty has is 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has is 6x. 

Since the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can write the equation: 
5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms: 
11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11: 
x = 15

Now that we know x, we can find the number of popsicles each of them has: 
Betty has 5x = 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles
Sam has 6x = 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 
90 - 75 = 15

"To find the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. 

The normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $20. 

Since Tim saves 20% by bundling, we need to find 20% of $20. 
20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, he saves $60 - $26 = $34 by cancelling his cable subscription.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total time spent, we need to add up the time spent writing, recording, and editing the song. 

Time spent writing: 4 hours

"To find the energy saved, we first need to find the original energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days. 

Original energy used per day = 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (or 7.2 kilowatt-hours, since 1 kilowatt-hour = 1000 watts * 1 hour)

Original energy used in 30 days = 7.2 kilowatt-hours/day * 30 days = 216 kilowatt-hours

Now, let's find the new energy used by the air conditioner after reducing the usage time by 5 hours.

New energy used per day = 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours (or 2.7 kilowatt-hours)

New energy used in 30 days = 2.7 kilowatt-hours/day * 30 days = 81 kilowatt-hours

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before his jog. 

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

He also took 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, before his jog, Elliott completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. 

10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps completed before jog) = 4,000 steps left to complete. However, he only had 2,000 steps left to take, so he must have taken the remaining 4,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps during his jog.

"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked for 40 hours at $15 per hour. So, the total amount paid to each employee in May is 40 hours * $15 per hour = $600. 

The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 employees * $600 per employee = $24,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. The remaining employees are 40 - 10 = 30 employees.

Each of the remaining employees worked for 40 hours at $15 per hour. So, the total amount paid to each employee in June is 40 hours * $15 per hour = $600.

The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 employees * $600 per employee = $18,000.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two events.

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50,000 candles smell like wet dog, so the number of candles that smell like wet dog is 0.05 * 50,000 = 2500.

Next, we need to find the number of candles that are more dangerous and have a 1% chance of exploding. However, the problem states that 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of the candles are more dangerous. So, the number of candles that are more dangerous is 0.01 * 50,000 = 500.

Now, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and are more dangerous. Since 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog, we need to find 5% of the 500 more dangerous candles. This is 0.05 * 500 = 25.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The combined total of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 30 + 60 + 15 + 45 = 150 apples.
- Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 150 = 350 apples.

"Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We know that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each. 

We are given two pieces of information: 
1. The total number of heads is 180, which means C + D = 180.
2. The total number of bumps is 304, which means 2C + D = 304.

We can solve this system of equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation to eliminate D:
2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting C into the first equation:
D = 180 - C
D = 180 - 124
D = 56

In the next 2 days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 km is:
(30/100) * 800 km = 240 km
So, the total distance traveled in the next 2 days is 240 km.

In the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each part of the trip:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The final answer is: 3140"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. So, Zack's locker is 4 times bigger than Peter's locker.
   Zack's locker size = 4 * Peter's locker size = 4 * 5 = 20 cubic inches
3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. So, Timothy's locker is twice as big as Zack's locker.
   Timothy's locker size = 2 * Zack's locker size = 2 * 20 = 40 cubic inches

"To find the elevation where Stanley's comb fell, we need to subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation. 

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation where the comb fell: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation where the comb fell and Oliver's elevation to determine how much Oliver needs to climb.

Elevation where the comb fell: 6,000 feet
Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

The final answer is: 3000"
"To find out how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from the two banks and add it to his initial capital.

The first bank gave him $4000. 
The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

So, the total amount of money he received from the banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Now, we add this amount to his initial capital of $5000. 
$12000 + $5000 = $17000.

The final answer is: $17000"
"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the steps:

1. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20 cats.
   Remaining cats = 50 - 20 = 30 cats.

2. 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran, we need to calculate 3/5 of 30.
   3/5 * 30 = (3 * 30) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18 cats.

3. Now, we need to subtract the number of cats that ran from the remaining cats.
   Cats left on the rock = 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different periods and calculate the cost for each period.

1. The first 6 months cost $8 per month, so the total cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.
2. The next 8 months cost $12 per month, so the total cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.
3. The remaining months in 2 years (24 months) - 6 - 8 = 10 months, cost $14 per month, so the total cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, we add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The final answer is: $284"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. 
   Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J. 
   We can write the equation: J = T - 6.

2. The total savings is $6. 
   Since Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 2/3 from the tattered jeans. 
   We can write the equation: (1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6.

3. Substitute J from the first equation into the second equation: 
   (1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6.

4. Multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 
   T - 6 + 2T = 18.

5. Combine like terms: 
   3T - 6 = 18.

6. Add 6 to both sides of the equation: 
   3T = 24.

7. Divide both sides of the equation by 3: 
   T = 8.

8. Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans, we can find the cost of the jogger jeans: 
   J = T - 6 = 8 - 6 = 2.

9. The jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how many cards he sold. Since he has $50 in spending cash and the ticket costs $100, he must have sold cards worth $50 to get the remaining $50. 

Since each card is sold for $1.5, the number of cards he sold is $50 / $1.5 = 33.33. However, since you can't sell a fraction of a card, we'll round down to 33 cards.

Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he kept is 1/3 * x, where x is the total number of cards he started with. The number of cards he sold is x - (1/3 * x) = 2/3 * x. We know this equals 33.

2/3 * x = 33
x = 33 * (3/2)
x = 49.5

Since you can't have a fraction of a card, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we'll round down to 49 because we know he sold 33 cards, and if he had 50 cards, he would have sold 33 and kept 17, which is not a multiple of 1/3."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many guests were expected to have two hotdogs. Since half of the 36 guests were expected to have two hotdogs, we can calculate this as follows:

36 / 2 = 18

So, 18 guests were expected to have two hotdogs. This means that 18 guests were expected to have one hotdog each, and the remaining 18 guests were expected to have two hotdogs.

Now, we know that 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that the 18 guests who were expected to have two hotdogs got their second hotdog, and the remaining 22 guests (40 - 18) got a second hotdog as well.

However, the problem asks how many guests did not get a second hotdog. Since the 18 guests who were expected to have one hotdog each got their one hotdog, and the remaining 22 guests got a second hotdog, we can conclude that the 18 guests who were expected to have one hotdog each did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we need to first find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

1. The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
2. The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
3. The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total cost of the utensils is 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.
4. The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.
5. To apply the 20% discount, we need to find 20% of $165.00, which is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.
6. The discount amount is $33.00, so we subtract this from the total cost before the discount: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, which means he spent 99% of his money. 
2. Since 1% of his money is equal to $0.01, 99% of his money is equal to $5 - $0.01 = $4.99.
3. The cost of 3 bags of chips is 3 * 40 cents = $1.20.
4. The amount of money George spent on chips is $1.20.
5. The amount of money George spent on candy bars is $4.99 - $1.20 = $3.79.
6. Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, the number of candy bars George bought is $3.79 / 0.75 = 5.0533. 
   Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to 5 candy bars.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. Since the area of the room is given as 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. 

1 yard = 3 feet
So, 3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:
Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room:
Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads they bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Difference in beads = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has

"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

Marcus bakes for 3 hours, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase due to the oven is 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.

The window is open for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes, so for 30 minutes, it cools down 2 degrees * (30/10) = 6 degrees.

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. The temperature increase due to the oven is 15 degrees, and the temperature decrease due to the open window is 6 degrees. 

So, the final temperature of the house is 40 + 15 - 6 = 49 degrees.

"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we first need to find out how long it took him to complete the entire triathlon. 

First, let's convert Jon's times into minutes: 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it took James to swim and bike. 
- James' swim time is 10% faster than Jon's, so it is 40 - (40 * 0.1) = 36 minutes.
- James' bike time is 5 minutes longer than Jon's, so it is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it took James to run. 
Total time for James: 180 minutes
Time for James to swim and bike: 36 + 85 = 121 minutes

"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to calculate the distance it runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, we need to convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 

Distance = Speed * Time = 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra.
2. The regular price of a soda is $3.
3. If you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2, it means the total cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda without the super ticket is $20 - $2 = $18.

Since the super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra, the cost of the movie ticket alone is $20 - $1 = $19. 

Now, let's consider the cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a soda and popcorn at regular price. The total cost in this case is $12 (movie ticket) + $3 (soda) + x (popcorn) = $18 (total cost without the super ticket).

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

12 + 3 + x = 18

Combine like terms:

15 + x = 18

Subtract 15 from both sides:

x = 3

So, the regular price of popcorn is $3."
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase as x. The total cost of filling 20 balloons before the price increase is $900. So, we can write the equation as 20x = 900.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: x = 900 / 20 = 45.

Now that we know the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase is $45, we can find the cost of filling one balloon after the price increase. The price increase is $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is 45 + 20 = 65.

Now, we can find the total cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase by multiplying the cost of filling one balloon by 170: 65 * 170 = 11050.

"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies separately and then add them together.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires is:
8 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $6400

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she now has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.
The value of the 3 sapphires she traded is:
3 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $2400

The value of the 2 rubies she received is:
2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400

Now, let's add the value of the sapphires and rubies together:
$6400 (sapphires) + $2400 (value of traded sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $11200

The total value of Jenna's jewels is $11200.

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and add them together.

The total weight of sugar cubes is 2 boxes * 1 pound per box = 2 pounds.

The total weight of carrots is 4 bags * 12 pounds per bag = 48 pounds.

The total weight of hay is 42 bales * 75 pounds per bale = 3150 pounds.

The total weight of oats is 20 sacks * 65 pounds per sack = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips needed.

3400 pounds / 2250 pounds per trip = 1.51 trips.

Since we can't make a fraction of a trip, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns in a week, we need to calculate the total value of the cans and bottles she recycles.

Aluminum cans: 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week
Plastic bottles: 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

Total earnings per week: 6 cents/week + 15 cents/week = 21 cents/week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly earnings by 4:
21 cents/week * 4 weeks/month = 84 cents/month

The final answer is: 84"

"Let's break down the problem. 

Let the number of carrot sticks Matt eats be 'x'. 

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. So, the number of cookies he can have is (x/2) + 2.

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation: (x/2) + 2 = 5.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: (x/2) = 5 - 2, which simplifies to (x/2) = 3.

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: x = 3 * 2, which simplifies to x = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit. Since the length of the shark is given in feet, we'll convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. 

1 foot = 12 inches
6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet

There are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras is. 

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / length of shark) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

"Let's denote the number of insects David found as D, the number of insects Bodhi found as B, and the number of insects Lily found as L.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write an equation: L = D + 7.

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write another equation: D = B/2.

We are also given that together they collected 43 insects, so the sum of the insects they found is L + D + B = 43.

Now we can substitute the first equation into the third equation: (D + 7) + D + B = 43.

Combine like terms: 2D + B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2D + B = 36.

Now substitute the second equation into this one: 2(D) + B = 36 becomes 2(B/2) + B = 36.

Simplify the equation: B + B = 36.

Combine like terms: 2B = 36.

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18.

Now that we know B, we can find D: D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9.

Now that we know D, we can find L: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar spent. 

A 2 x 4 gives 200 sticks for $4, so the cost per stick is $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick.
A 2 x 8 gives 400 sticks for $6, so the cost per stick is $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick.

Since a 2 x 8 gives more sticks per dollar, we will use this type of wood. 

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with $24: 
$24 / $6 = 4

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks, we multiply the number of pieces by the number of sticks per piece:

"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we need to first find the total number of snowshoes needed. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24. Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes needed is 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of snowshoes needed by the cost of each pair. The total cost is 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To find out how much Janet spends on bus trips in a week, we need to multiply the cost of one bus trip by the number of trips she takes in a week. 

Cost of one bus trip: $2.20
Number of trips in a week: 5

Total weekly cost of bus trips: $2.20 * 5 = $11.00

Now, we need to find out how much she would save by buying a weekly bus pass for $20. 

Weekly bus pass cost: $20
Weekly bus trip cost: $11.00

Amount saved: $20 - $11.00 = $9.00

The final answer is: $9.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The farm has 30 cows.
- The zoo has 20 sheep.
- The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
- The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Total animals in the farm and the zoo: 40 + 80 = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'. 

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can write the equation as:
x + y = 4(x + y)

Given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, we can write the equation as:
x + y = 4(x + y)
12 + 4 = 4x + 4y
16 = 4x + 4y

Now, divide both sides by 4:
4 = x + y

Since we know that x + y = 4, we can substitute this into the equation:
4 = 4

However, we need to find the individual values of x and y. We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, and that she bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. This means that the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 1/4 of the total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought.

Total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought = 12 + 4 = 16
Total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought = 16 / 4 = 4

Since Sophia bought 4 onions and potatoes in total, and we know that she bought 4 potatoes, we can find the number of onions she bought:
Number of onions Sophia bought = Total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought - Number of potatoes Sophia bought
= 4 - 4
= 0

However, this is not possible as Sophia must have bought some onions. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, and that she bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. This means that the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 1/4 of the total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought.

Total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought = 12 + 4 = 16
Total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought = 16 / 4 = 4

However, this is the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, not the individual values of x and y. We know that x + y = 4, but we also know that the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 4. This means that x and y must be equal.

x = y = 4 / 2
x = y = 2

So, Sophia bought 2 onions and 2 potatoes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the number of days Andy has to lose the weight, we need to subtract his birthday from the current date. 

December 31st to July 19th is approximately 6 months and 19 days. 

There are 30 days in a month, so 6 months is 6 * 30 = 180 days. 
Adding the remaining 19 days, Andy has 180 + 19 = 199 days to lose the weight.

Since Andy wants to lose 30 lbs, and he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories in total.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 105,000 / 199 ≈ 527 calories.

The final answer is: 527"
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate how much he earned in a week and then subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald earns $30 per day. There are 7 days in a week, so he earns 30 * 7 = $210 in a week.

Gerald spent $100, so to find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from the amount he earned: 210 - 100 = $110.

"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total distance she will run. 

Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, the total distance is:
0.25 km/lap * 8 laps = 2 km

Now, we know Hannah needs 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. So, for 2 km, she will need:
60 ml/km * 2 km = 120 ml

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Julie started with $500.
2. She spent 20% of $500 on clothes. 
   20% of $500 = 0.2 * $500 = $100
   So, she spent $100 on clothes and had $500 - $100 = $400 left.
3. Then, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.
   25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100
   So, she spent $100 on CDs and had $400 - $100 = $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we can find the cost of the house by multiplying x by 3:

Cost of the house = 3x = 3 * 30,000 = 90,000

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To find the profit, we need to first find the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the packs of canvas bags. Since Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each, the total cost is:
8 packs * 5 bags/pack * $4/bag = $160

The total revenue is the amount she earned from selling the bags. Since she sold each bag for $8, the total revenue is:
8 bags * $8/bag = $64

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost:
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $64 - $160
Profit = -$96

However, since profit cannot be negative, it seems there is an error in the problem. The problem states that she sold each bag for $8, but the total revenue is less than the total cost. This is not possible. 

However, if we assume that the problem is asking for the profit per bag, we can calculate it as follows:
Profit per bag = (Selling price - Cost price) per bag
Profit per bag = ($8 - $4) per bag
Profit per bag = $4 per bag

Since there are 40 bags (8 packs * 5 bags/pack), the total profit is:
Total Profit = Profit per bag * Total number of bags
Total Profit = $4 * 40
Total Profit = $160"
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total number of minutes in the fight and multiply it by the average number of punches he throws per minute.

There are 5 rounds of 3 minutes each, so the total number of minutes is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, the total number of punches he threw is 15 * 25 = 375 punches.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Ali has:
   Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. 
   Total money from $10 bills = 4 * $10 = $40
   Total money from $20 bills = 6 * $20 = $120
   Total money = $40 + $120 = $160

2. Ali gives his sister half of the total money:
   Half of the total money = $160 / 2 = $80
   Money left after giving his sister half = $160 - $80 = $80

3. Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner:
   3/5 of the remaining money = (3/5) * $80 = $48
   Money left after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32

"To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to calculate the total number of problems he completed and subtract that from the total number of problems.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems.
On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.
So, in total, Chris completed 12 + 36 = 48 problems on Monday and Tuesday.

The total number of problems is 100. Chris completed 48 problems, so he has 100 - 48 = 52 problems left.

On Wednesday, Chris completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

Now, we need to subtract the problems he completed on Wednesday from the remaining problems: 52 - 13 = 39.

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to find the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour and add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Now, let's add the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour:

To find the number of rows of blue tulips, we need to divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

Number of blue tulips = 24
Number of tulips per row = 8
Number of rows of blue tulips = 24 / 8 = 3

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips. 

Total number of rows = 6 + 3 = 9

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to first find out how many cups of raisins she has available for the oatmeal cookies. 

Since she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, she will have 1/3 of the raisins for the oatmeal cookies. 

1/3 of 27 cups is 27 / 3 = 9 cups. 

Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we need to divide 9 cups by 3/4 to find out how many batches she can make. 

To divide 9 by 3/4, we multiply 9 by 4/3. 

9 * 4/3 = 36/3 = 12

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then 5 people can paint half a house in 5 / 5 = 1 day. 

Since 5 people can paint half a house in 1 day, they can paint a whole house in 2 days (because 2 * 0.5 = 1).

Now, we need to convert the days into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 2 days is equal to 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:
Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so she has 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture.
Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so she has 64 + 66 = 130 pieces of furniture.
The total number of sofas and chairs they have is 42 + 130 = 172.

"Let's break down the information given. Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set for an unknown price. The total cost was $48. 

Let's denote the price of the headphone set as 'x'. We can set up the equation as follows:

4 + x = 48

To find the price of the headphone set, we need to subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

x = 48 - 4
x = 44

So, the price of the headphone set is $44.

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he had not bought the headphone set. He had $48 left after buying the CD. 

Number of CDs = Total money / Price of one CD
= 48 / 4
= 12

If he had not bought the headphone set, he would have had $44 left. 

Number of CDs = Total money / Price of one CD
= 44 / 4
= 11

To find out how many more CDs he could have bought, we need to subtract the number of CDs he could have bought with $44 from the number of CDs he could have bought with $48:

Number of additional CDs = 12 - 11

"To find the number of passengers after the first stop, we need to subtract the number of passengers who got off and add the number of passengers who got in. 

Initially, there were 48 passengers. 
8 passengers got off, so we subtract 8 from 48: 48 - 8 = 40.
5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) got in, so 5 * 8 = 40 passengers got in.
Now, we add the number of passengers who got in to the number of passengers who remained: 40 + 40 = 80.

Now, let's find the number of passengers after the second stop. 
21 passengers got off, so we subtract 21 from 80: 80 - 21 = 59.
3 times fewer passengers got on, which means 3 times 21 is 63, but 3 times fewer means 63 - 21 = 42 passengers got in.

   Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.
   Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years.
   So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.
3. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.

1. Total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer = $2,400
2. Cost of the computer = $1,100
3. The printer cost $400 less than the computer.

First, let's find the cost of the printer. Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer:
Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
= $1,100 - $400
= $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, printer, and 2 monitors is $2,400. We can subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from this total to find the cost of the 2 monitors:
Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - (Cost of the computer + Cost of the printer)
= $2,400 - ($1,100 + $700)
= $2,400 - $1,800
= $600

Since we want to find the cost of one monitor, we divide the cost of 2 monitors by 2:
Cost of one monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
= $600 / 2

"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we first need to find out how many seashells the girls brought in total. 

Since there are 20 kids in total and they were divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls. 

The boys brought 60 shells each, so the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 60 shells.

First, we calculate 4 * 60, which is 240. 

Then, we add 600 + 240, which equals 840.

Since there are 10 girls, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by 10 to find out how many shells each girl brought. 

840 / 10 = 84.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's assume the number of days in the first half of April is x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half will also be x.

2. The total number of days in April is 30, so x + x = 30. 
   2x = 30
   x = 15

   So, the first half of April has 15 days and the second half also has 15 days.

3. Let's assume Elvis saves y dollars per day in the first half of April. 
   The total amount saved in the first half will be 15y.

4. Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, he will save 2y dollars per day in the second half.
   The total amount saved in the second half will be 15 * 2y = 30y.

5. The total amount saved in April should be $1125. 
   15y + 30y = 1125
   45y = 1125
   y = 1125 / 45
   y = 25

6. Elvis has to save $25 per day in the first half of April.

"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice: 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters
2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once: 26 / 2 = 13 letters
3. So, the total number of letters written so far is 52 + 13 = 65 letters
4. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written: 65 letters

Now, let's add the re-written letters to the total: 65 + 65 = 130 letters

"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first determine the total number of toys in the sorted play set five times larger than James's play set. 

James's play set has 80 toys. A play set five times larger than James's would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a play set five times larger than James's, we can set up an equation: 

Let x be the number of toys Jonathan currently has. Then, x + 2 = 400.

To find x, we need to subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

The final answer is: 398"

Commission for the first $1000: 30% of $1000 = 0.3 * $1000 = $300

Commission for the sales over $1000: $2500 - $1000 = $1500
Additional commission for the sales over $1000: 10% of $1500 = 0.1 * $1500 = $150

Total commission: $300 + $150 = $450

The total amount of money Antonella earned is $450."
"To find out how many bottles Bill already has, we need to multiply the number of cases by the number of bottles in each case. 

2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

Since Bill wants 2 bottles for each of his 70 guests, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of bottles per guest.

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

To find out how many more bottles Bill needs, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs.

"Let's break down the information given:

- When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
- When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as it takes him to swim a mile in cold water.

First, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. 

Twice the time it takes to swim a mile in cold water is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes.
2 minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold water and 3 miles in warm water.

In cold water, it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile. So, to swim 3 miles, it will take him 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

In warm water, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile. So, to swim 3 miles, it will take him 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

"To find out how many cups Juan needs to reduce, we first need to determine how many cups he currently drinks. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, and Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, we need to know the daily recommended amount of coffee.

Let's assume the daily recommended amount of coffee is x cups. Then, Octavia drinks x/2 cups, and Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

We are given that the daily recommended amount is 4 cups. So, x = 4.

Now, we can find out how many cups Juan currently drinks: 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups.

To find out how many cups Juan needs to reduce, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake: 20 - 4 = 16 cups.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week and then convert that to pages. 

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we need to find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which is 105 / 1.5 = 70.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, she can read 2 * 70 = 140 pages in 105 minutes.

Peter spent from Sunday through Wednesday on wooden action figures, which is 4 days. He spent $5 each day, so the total amount spent on wooden action figures is 4 * $5 = $20.

He has $70 initially and spent $20 on wooden action figures, so he has $70 - $20 = $50 left. 

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures, which cost $2 each. There are 3 days left in the week, so the total amount spent on plastic action figures is 3 * $2 = $6.

He has $50 left and spent $6 on plastic action figures, so he has $50 - $6 = $44 left.

Now, let's find the total number of wooden action figures he bought: $20 / $5 = 4.

"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. So, the cost of bread for 1 sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30. 

The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00. So, the cost of cheese and condiments for 1 sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00.

The total cost for 1 sandwich is $0.30 (bread) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $3.30.

The revenue from selling 1 sandwich is $7.00.

The net profit for 1 sandwich is $7.00 (revenue) - $3.30 (cost) = $3.70.

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together in each muffin tin, and there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we need to find out how many small pieces of crayons there are in total. 

There are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, so there are 3 * 64 = 192 small pieces of crayons.

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together in each muffin tin, we need to divide the total number of small pieces of crayons by 8 to find out how many muffin crayons she can make. 

192 / 8 = 24 muffin crayons.

Now that we know Kate can make 24 muffin crayons, we can multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price of each muffin crayon to find out how much money Kate can make.

"To find the total number of contacts, we multiply the number of contacts in one box by the number of boxes Pete buys: 90 contacts/box * 2 boxes = 180 contacts.

Since the contacts will last Pete 45 days, we can find the number of contacts he uses per day: 90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts/day.

To find the total number of days the contacts will last, we multiply the number of contacts by the number of contacts used per day: 180 contacts / 2 contacts/day = 90 days.

Since the contacts will last 90 days, Pete only needs to buy 1 box of contacts, not 2. However, we will continue with the original plan to find the cost per pair of contacts.

The discount is 10% off the original price of $100.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $100.00 * 0.10 = $10.00.

To find the discounted price, we subtract the discount from the original price: $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is $90.00 * 2 = $180.00.

To find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts: $180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact.

Since there are 2 contacts in a pair, the cost per pair of contacts is $1.00 * 2 = $2.00."

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans) and G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans).

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3.01B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3.01:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:

G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM. 
After some lessons, his typing speed increased to 52 WPM. 
If he continues to increase his typing speed once more by 5 words, his new typing speed will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we have the three measurements: 47, 52, and 57. 

To find the average, we add the three measurements and divide by 3: 
(47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"To find the difference in weight, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then subtract the weight gained from the weight lost.

Weight lost per week by eating Cheerios: -1.25 pounds/week
Weight gained per week by eating donuts: 1.75 pounds/week

Weight change after 5 weeks by eating Cheerios: -1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = -6.25 pounds
Weight change after 5 weeks by eating donuts: 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

Difference in weight after 5 weeks: 8.75 pounds - (-6.25 pounds) = 8.75 pounds + 6.25 pounds = 15 pounds

"To find the total number of people attending, we need to break down the information given:

1. Alex invites 100 people via email, and each invited person says they will also invite 2 friends. 
   This means each of the 100 people will bring 2 friends, so the total number of people from these invitations is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

2. Alex then calls 10 of her friends to invite them too. 
   Since 8 of them say they will be bringing their spouses, that's 8 additional people. 
   So, the total number of people from these invitations is 10 + 8 = 18.

3. To find the total number of people attending, we add the people from the email invitations and the people from the phone calls: 300 + 18 = 318.

However, we also need to include Alex herself, so the total number of seats needed is 318 + 1 = 319.

The final answer is: 319"
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to find the weight of the Papillon first, then multiply it by 44.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find the total cost of the boots on Amazon, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. 

Amazon cost = $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20

On eBay, the shipping cost is twice as much as on Amazon, so the shipping cost is $4 * 2 = $8.

eBay cost = $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping) = $21

Now, we need to find the difference between the eBay cost and the Amazon cost.

Difference = eBay cost - Amazon cost = $21 - $20 = $1

The boots work out to be $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to reach or exceed 20 feet. 

The beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles every day. 

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, so we can write the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown, and then subtract the deposit he has already paid.

The base price of each implant is $2000, and he needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

He wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

He has already paid a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since he makes $15 per hour at work, to find out how many hours he needs to work to pay for the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, it is 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. 
One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees.
The other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents.

8 quarters = 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
6 dimes = 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

Total amount of money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball
= 345 cents / 5 cents

"To find the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds and add it to 8 pounds.

50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds.

So, the weight after increasing by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

Since Jamaal then uses a weight two pounds lighter than that, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

"To find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to first find out how many pounds Ruiz makes in an hour. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how many pounds he makes in an hour, we divide 120 by 2. 
120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour. 
3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, we know that Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour and Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour. They both work for 12 hours a day. 

Ruiz's total production in 12 hours = 60 * 12 = 720 pounds
Marissa's total production in 12 hours = 45 * 12 = 540 pounds

Total production of both Ruiz and Marissa = 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds

Total amount earned in 4 hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

In the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
Total cups sold in 2 hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups
Total amount earned in 2 hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

"To find out how many times the tires rotate in a month, we need to multiply the number of miles driven in a month by the number of rotations per mile. 

Rotations per mile = 725
Miles driven in a month = 400
Total rotations in a month = 725 * 400 = 290,000

Now, we need to find out how many months the tire can last. 

Total rotations allowed = 10,440,000
Total rotations in a month = 290,000
Months the tire can last = Total rotations allowed / Total rotations in a month = 10,440,000 / 290,000 = 36

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find out how many years the tire can last by dividing the total months by 12.

Years the tire can last = 36 / 12 = 3

"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings. 

Since there are 60 washings per pump, and the total cost is $24.00, we need to find the cost per pump. 

First, we convert the total cost to cents: $24.00 * 100 = 2400 cents.

Now, we divide the total cost in cents by the total number of pumps: 2400 cents / 2 pumps = 1200 cents per 2 pumps.

To find the cost per pump, we divide the cost per 2 pumps by 2: 1200 cents / 2 = 600 cents per pump.

"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of croissants he wants to make is:
4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, the total number of croissants is:
28 dozen * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we know it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how much butter is needed for 336 croissants, we need to multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen:
336 croissants * (1/4 pound/croissant) = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit first. 

1. Calculate the cost of the cars: 10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000
2. Calculate the company's cost to acquire the cars: 30% of $250,000 = 0.3 * $250,000 = $75,000
3. Calculate the profit: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000
4. Calculate James' commission: 10% of $175,000 = 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500

So, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of men who can stay upright, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, and there are 100 riders, we can calculate this as 25% of 100, which is 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders.

Next, we are told that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women, we can calculate 60% of 25, which is 0.6 * 25 = 15 women.

Since there are 25 riders in total who can stay upright, and 15 of them are women, the number of men who can stay upright is 25 - 15 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to find the price of the gold and silver jewels first.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

Given that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
- He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.
- He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps together: 
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the time it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to determine the relative speed between them. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Bob's speed from Tom's speed.

Tom's speed: 70 miles per hour
Bob's speed: 55 miles per hour
Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed = 70 - 55 = 15 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it will take for Tom to cover the initial distance between them, which is 75 miles.

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Total cost of classes = $60
Number of classes = 10

Cost per class = Total cost of classes / Number of classes
Cost per class = $60 / 10
Cost per class = $6

Since Manny's parents won't sign him up again if the classes cost more than $10 per class, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can attend at $6 per class without exceeding $10 per class.

Let's say Manny attends x classes at $6 per class. The total cost of these classes should be less than or equal to $10 per class.

6x ≤ 10

To find the maximum number of classes, we can divide both sides of the inequality by 6.

x ≤ 10/6
x ≤ 1.67

Since Manny can't attend a fraction of a class, we round down to the nearest whole number.

x ≤ 1

However, this is the number of classes he can attend at $6 per class. To find the total number of classes he can miss, we subtract this from the total number of classes.

Total classes = 10
Classes he can attend = 1
Classes he can miss = Total classes - Classes he can attend
Classes he can miss = 10 - 1
Classes he can miss = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total weekly production, we first need to find out how many customers each of them can process in a week. 

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jewel's weekly production is 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie's daily production is 2 * 50 = 100 customers. 

So, Julie's weekly production is 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for the two is 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to first determine how many miles Reggie ran.

"To find the cost of 5 apples, we need to first find the cost of one apple. 

Cost of 4 apples = $5.20
Cost of 1 apple = $5.20 / 4 = $1.30

Now, we can find the cost of 5 apples.
Cost of 5 apples = $1.30 * 5 = $6.50

To find the cost of 5 oranges, we need to first find the cost of one orange.

Cost of 3 oranges = $3.30
Cost of 1 orange = $3.30 / 3 = $1.10

Now, we can find the cost of 5 oranges.
Cost of 5 oranges = $1.10 * 5 = $5.50

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges.
Total cost = Cost of 5 apples + Cost of 5 oranges
Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50
Total cost = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the features and the base price:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

"To find the total amount Tim will make in a year, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary:
5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Next, let's calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary:
Bonus = $20,000 / 2 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly income:
Total monthly income = New monthly salary + Bonus = $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

Finally, let's calculate the total amount Tim will make in a year:

"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can set up the equation for the total number of legs: 4S + 2G = 70.

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, which means S + G = 20.

We can solve the second equation for G: G = 20 - S.

Now, substitute G in the first equation: 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

Expand the equation: 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

We know that Christina had 12 good days in total. We already know that the first 8 days and the last 3 days were good, which is 8 + 2 = 10 good days. 

Since Christina had 12 good days in total, the number of good days left is 12 - 10 = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:

Janey's books = 2x + 3

We are given that Janey has 21 books. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. 

1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so 20 feet is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 inches.

Now, we need to find the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches). 

600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days it will take to reach 600 inches.

360 / 30 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. 
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs 8 more toys for these dogs. Now, he has 4 (initial toys) + 8 (new toys) = 12 toys for 12 dogs.
3. When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs. So, he needs 16 more toys for these dogs. Now, he has 12 (previous toys) + 16 (new toys) = 28 toys for 28 dogs.
4. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. Now, he has 28 - 3 = 25 toys for 25 dogs.

However, the question asks for the total number of toys James needs. Since he has 25 toys, but there are 25 dogs, he actually needs 25 more toys to have one toy for each dog.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow the sequence of investments.

Initially, the total amount invested is $1200.

Dylan's investment is 2/5 of the total amount:
Dylan's investment = (2/5) * 1200 = 480

The remaining amount after Dylan's investment is:
Remaining amount = 1200 - 480 = 720

Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount:
Frances' investment = (2/3) * 720 = 480

The remaining amount after Frances' investment is:
Remaining amount = 720 - 480 = 240

Skyler's investment is the remaining amount:
Skyler's investment = 240

"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we first need to find out how many signatures they have in total so far. Carol has 20 signatures and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 

Total signatures so far = 20 + 44 = 64

They want to reach a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer. Since they already have 64 signatures, we need to find out how many more signatures they need to collect.

Signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36

They have three more weeks of summer vacation, and they want to reach their goal. Since we don't know how many signatures they collect per week, we can't calculate the exact number of signatures they need to collect per week. However, we can calculate the total number of signatures they need to collect to reach their goal.

The final answer is 36."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to find out how much she earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Karen works in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, in two days she works 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can find out how much Karen earns in two days by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works: $20 * 6 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a ratio of potatoes to hash browns as follows: 

6 potatoes : 36 hash browns

To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we can set up a proportion:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

6x = 96 * 36

6x = 3456

Now, we can divide both sides by 6 to find x:

x = 3456 / 6
x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

"To find the total weight of the 9 adults, we need to multiply the average weight of an adult by the number of adults. 

Total weight = 80 kg/adult * 9 adults = 720 kg

Since the elevator supports a maximum load of 700 kg, we need to find the difference between the total weight and the maximum load.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

"To find the total number of cookies, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has. 

Katarina has 68 cookies. 
Max has 5 more cookies than Katarina, so Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.
The Cookie Monster has 12 less cookies than Max, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.
Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies: 
68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = 298

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to first subtract the 20cm added with the lace trim from the final length. 

Final length = 140cm
Lace trim = 20cm
Original length before lace trim = 140cm - 20cm = 120cm

Now, we know that the dress was extended by 50% of its original length. Let's call the original length 'x'. Then, the extended length is x + 50% of x, which is equal to 120cm.

x + 0.5x = 120cm
Combine like terms: 1.5x = 120cm
Divide both sides by 1.5: x = 80cm

"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took for each mode and then add them together.

Time in turtle mode = 1 hour = 60 minutes
Time in rabbit mode = 40 minutes

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to multiply the time for each mode by 0.5 (half).

Time in turtle mode = 60 * 0.5 = 30 minutes
Time in rabbit mode = 40 * 0.5 = 20 minutes

Now, we add the time for both modes to get the total time.

Total time = Time in turtle mode + Time in rabbit mode
Total time = 30 + 20
Total time = 50 minutes

"To find out how many cookies are in the box, we first need to determine the total number of cookies baked by Greta and Celinda. 

Greta bakes 30 cookies. 
Celinda bakes twice as many as Greta, so she bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies is 30 (Greta's cookies) + 60 (Celinda's cookies) = 90 cookies.

They eat 10 cookies, so the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. 

Since there are two twins and one triplet, the total age is 2T + t. We are given that their combined ages are 44, so we can write the equation: 2T + t = 44.

We are also given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet. This means that the older twin's age is 7 years more than the triplet's age, so we can write the equation: T+7 = t.

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for T. 

2T + (T+7) = 44
Combine like terms: 
3T + 7 = 44
Subtract 7 from both sides: 
3T = 37
Divide both sides by 3: 
T = 12.33

However, since age cannot be a fraction, we will round down to the nearest whole number."

"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year) and 10 (the number of years).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 coins more than Rong. 
So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year = 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year = 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings = 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings = 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

Now, let's add their total savings to find out how many coins they have after 10 years:

"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, but we don't know the total bill yet. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

"To find the total number of squares, we need to find the number of each color and add them together.

The number of red squares is 14.
The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares, so it is 14 + 4 = 18.
The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares, so it is 18 + 6 = 24.
The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares, so it is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, we add the number of each color of squares together: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68.

The total number of squares is 68, and each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the cost of picking the blueberries and the cost of buying them at the store.

Cost of picking blueberries: 
- Cost to go picking: $20
- Cost per pound: $1.5
- Total pounds picked: 30
- Total cost of picking: $20 + ($1.5 * 30) = $20 + $45 = $65

Cost of buying at the store:
- Cost per pound: $2.5
- Total pounds picked: 30
- Total cost at the store: $2.5 * 30 = $75

Now, let's find the difference:
- Difference = Cost at the store - Cost of picking = $75 - $65 = $10

James saved $10 by picking blueberries instead of buying them at the store.

The final answer is: $10"
"To find the new price of each computer, we need to calculate 10% of the original price and add it to the original price.

Original price per computer = $700
Increase in price = 10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70
New price per computer = Original price + Increase in price = $700 + $70 = $770

Now, we can find the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices.

Total number of computers = 500
Total amount paid = New price per computer * Total number of computers
Total amount paid = $770 * 500
Total amount paid = $385,000

The final answer is: $385,000"
"To find the total calories in the omelet, we need to calculate the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

Eggs: 6 eggs * 75 calories per egg = 450 calories
Cheese: 2 oz * 120 calories per oz = 240 calories
Ham: 2 oz * 40 calories per oz = 80 calories

Total calories = 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories

The final answer is: 770"
"To find the total cost of the pencils, multiply the cost of one pencil by the number of pencils: 
6 pencils * $0.50 = $3

To find the total cost of the erasers, multiply the cost of one eraser by the number of erasers: 
8 erasers * $0.25 = $2

Now, add the total cost of the pencils and erasers to find the total cost of the items: 
$3 + $2 = $5

Since you paid $10, subtract the total cost from the amount paid to find the change: 
$10 - $5 = $5

"To find the number of people who accept the position, we need to follow the given percentages step by step.

1. First, we find the number of people who receive interviews: 30% of 100 people.
   30% of 100 = 0.3 * 100 = 30 people

2. Then, we find the number of people who receive a job offer: 20% of the people who received interviews.
   20% of 30 = 0.2 * 30 = 6 people

3. Finally, we find the number of people who accept the position: a third of the people who received a job offer.
   A third of 6 = 6 / 3 = 2 people

"To find out how many kilograms of rice Goldy gave to her cousin and brother, we need to first find out how many sacks she gave to them in total. 

Goldy gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother, so the total number of sacks she gave away is 3 + 4 = 7 sacks.

Since each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice, we multiply the total number of sacks given away by the weight of each sack: 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms.

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the number of taps for both scenarios (with arms down and with arms up) and add them together.

Scenario 1: Arms down
- Right foot taps per minute: 300
- Left foot taps per minute: 250
- Total taps per minute: 300 + 250 = 550
- Total taps for 3 minutes: 550 * 3 = 1650

Scenario 2: Arms up
- Right foot taps per minute: 200
- Left foot taps per minute: 200
- Total taps per minute: 200 + 200 = 400
- Total taps for 2 minutes: 400 * 2 = 800

Total taps = 1650 + 800 = 2450

"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and subtract it from the total damage it will cause to his car.

The total damage to his car is $450.

The cost of fixing the pothole includes the fine for unauthorized road maintenance, which is $120, and the cost of 3 buckets of asphalt, which is 3 * $25 = $75.

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $120 + $75 = $195.

Now, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the total damage it will cause to his car: $450 - $195 = $255.

Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.

"To find the total number of chairs left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent to the carpenter from the total number of chairs initially available.

Total normal chairs initially = 170
Total baby chairs initially = 23
Total chairs initially = 170 + 23 = 193

Normal chairs sent to the carpenter = 20
Baby chairs sent to the carpenter = 13
Total chairs sent to the carpenter = 20 + 13 = 33

Total chairs left = Total chairs initially - Total chairs sent to the carpenter
Total chairs left = 193 - 33
Total chairs left = 160

"To find the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends, we first need to find the total number of slices they ate. Since there are 5 people in total (Bryce and 4 friends), and 2/3 of their pizzas were eaten, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by them.

First, let's find the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends. Since each pizza has 12 slices, and they ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by them as follows:

(2/3) * 12 = 8 slices per person
Since there are 3 people (Bryce and 2 friends), the total number of slices eaten by them is:
8 * 3 = 24 slices

Now, let's find the total number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends. They ate ¾ of their pizzas, which is:
(3/4) * 12 = 9 slices per person
Since there are 2 people, the total number of slices eaten by them is:
9 * 2 = 18 slices

Now, let's find the total number of slices eaten by all 5 people:
24 + 18 = 42 slices

Since each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of pizzas ordered is:
42 / 12 = 3.5 pizzas
Since we can't have a fraction of a pizza, we can assume that 3 pizzas were ordered.

Now, let's find the total number of slices in 3 pizzas:
3 * 12 = 36 slices

Since 42 slices were eaten, the number of slices left is:
36 - 42 = -6 slices

"To find the time the dog takes to eat the sausages, we need to multiply the time the cat takes by 2/3. 

Time taken by cat = 30 minutes
Time taken by dog = (2/3) * 30 minutes = 20 minutes

Now, we need to find the average time taken by both the cat and the dog. 

Average time = (Time taken by cat + Time taken by dog) / 2
= (30 + 20) / 2
= 50 / 2
= 25 minutes

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so 8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding 4 inches to that gives us 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches, and it is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes 'x'. 

We can write the equation as: 100 = 9x + 10

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us: 90 = 9x

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us: x = 10

"To find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows smashed from students' cars:
- Number of students' cars: 64
- Number of windows per car: 4
- Fraction of windows smashed: 1/4
- Total windows smashed from students' cars = (1/4) * (64 * 4) = (1/4) * 256 = 64

Next, let's find the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars:
- Number of teachers' cars: 32
- Number of windows per car: 2
- Fraction of windows smashed: 3/4
- Total windows smashed from teachers' cars = (3/4) * (32 * 2) = (3/4) * 64 = 48

Now, let's add the total number of windows smashed from students' and teachers' cars:
Total windows smashed = 64 + 48 = 112

Next, we need to find the total number of spools. 

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 and subtract that from the total number of people.

At 8:00, 2/5 of 5000 people had voted. 
2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by 12:00.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
The remaining people at 12:00 are 5000 - 2000 = 3000.
2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people voted by 16:00.

So, the total number of people who voted by 16:00 is 2000 (by 12:00) + 2000 (by 16:00) = 4000.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 5000 - 4000 = 1000.

"To find out how many boxes of graham crackers are needed, we first need to calculate the total number of smores required.

9 kids want 2 smores each, so the total number of smores for kids is 9 * 2 = 18.
6 adults will eat 1 smore each, so the total number of smores for adults is 6 * 1 = 6.
The total number of smores required is 18 (for kids) + 6 (for adults) = 24.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores, the total number of sleeves needed is 24 / 8 = 3.
Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, the total number of boxes needed is 3 (sleeves) / 3 (sleeves per box) = 1.

"To find out how many apples Beck has, we need to subtract 23 from Boris's apples and then add 10. 

Boris has 100 apples. 
Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples. 
Boris gives Beck 10 apples, so Beck now has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris. 
Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 87 apples. 
So, the difference is 100 - 87 = 13.

"To find the cost of a half-gallon jar, we know that a gallon jar costs $5 and a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. 

Cost of a half-gallon jar = Cost of a gallon jar - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 10-gallon jars:
Total cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5
Total cost of 10-gallon jars = $50

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 16 half-gallon jars:

"To find out how many groups are needed, we first need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups required for the activity. 

Total students = 54
Groups required for the activity = 12

However, the question states that the activity requires 12 groups, but we are asked to find out how many more groups are needed to form, given that 54 students are to be separated into six groups of equal size. 

So, we first need to find out how many students are in each group for the activity. 

Students per group for the activity = Total students / Groups required for the activity
Students per group for the activity = 54 / 12
Students per group for the activity = 4.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we will round down to 4 students per group for the activity.

Now, we need to find out how many groups of 4 students can be formed with 54 students.

Groups of 4 students = Total students / Students per group
Groups of 4 students = 54 / 4
Groups of 4 students = 13.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we will round down to 13 groups of 4 students.

Now, we need to find out how many more groups are needed to form 12 groups.

More groups needed = Groups required for the activity - Groups of 4 students
More groups needed = 12 - 13
More groups needed = -1

However, since we can't have a negative number of groups, we will consider the absolute value of the result.

More groups needed = | -1 |
More groups needed = 1

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (40 - 20 = 20) for small buttons. 
Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has:
- Small buttons: 27 (from small stickers) + 60 (from large stickers) = 87 small buttons
- Large buttons: 20 (from large stickers) + 20 (from large stickers) = 40 large buttons

Total buttons = 87 small buttons + 40 large buttons = 127 buttons.

3. There are 6 Pomeranian girls.

From point 2, we know that 1/3 of the Pomeranians are girls, and we are given that this number is 6. To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that 2/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and we found that there are 18 Pomeranians. To find the total number of puppies, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)

- The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250.
- The first house needs 1/2 of what the second house needs.
- The third house needs double what the first house needs.

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as x. Then, the first house needs x/2 cases, and the third house needs 2*(x/2) = x cases.

Since the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250, we can set up the equation:

x + (x/2) + x = 250

To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms:

5x = 500

Now, divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

Since the third house needs x cases, which is 100 cases, the answer is:

400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

The cost of the older movies is:
160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are normal movies. We subtract the number of older movies from the remaining movies:
400 - 160 = 240 normal movies

The cost of the normal movies is:
240 * $10 = $2400

Now, we add the cost of the series, the older movies, and the normal movies to find the total cost:
$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

The final answer is: $4400"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

Cost of peaches: 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
Cost of plums: 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
Cost of apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Total cost = $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To find the distance, we first need to find the speed at which they hiked. They drove at 50 miles per hour. Half of that is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. They hiked 5 miles per hour less than that, so they hiked at 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

The time they hiked is 1.5 hours. To find the distance they hiked, we multiply the speed by the time: 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

The time they drove is 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours. To find the distance they drove, we multiply the speed by the time: 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

The total distance is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked: 225 + 30 = 255 miles.

The final answer is: 255"
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the scores of Ava and Emma separately and then find the difference.

Let's assume Emma's score is x. 

Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava jumps on (x + 8) enemies. 
Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, Ava collects (x + 3) berries.

The time difference between Ava and Emma is 4 seconds, so Emma finishes the level 4 seconds earlier than Ava. 
Since Emma finishes the level 4 seconds earlier, Emma's timer score is 30 * (60 - (60 - 4)) = 30 * 4 = 120 points. 
Ava's timer score is 30 * (60 - (60 - 4)) - 4 = 30 * 4 - 4 = 116 points.

Now, let's calculate their scores:
Emma's score = x + 5 * (number of berries Emma collects) + 120
Emma's score = x + 5 * (number of berries Emma collects) + 120
Emma's score = x + 5 * (number of berries Emma collects) + 120

Ava's score = (x + 8) + 5 * (x + 3) + 116
Ava's score = x + 8 + 5x + 15 + 116
Ava's score = 6x + 139

Now, we need to find the difference between their scores:
Difference = Ava's score - Emma's score
Difference = (6x + 139) - (x + 5 * (number of berries Emma collects) + 120)
Since we don't know the number of berries Emma collects, let's assume it is y. 
Difference = (6x + 139) - (x + 5y + 120)
Difference = 5x - 5y + 19

However, we know that Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so y = x - 3. 
Difference = 5x - 5(x - 3) + 19
Difference = 5x - 5x + 15 + 19
Difference = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to find the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. 

Two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, so the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 x 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the cost of the other two pizzas. 

Total cost of all four pizzas = 64 dollars
Cost of two known pizzas = 60 dollars
Cost of the other two pizzas = Total cost of all four pizzas - Cost of two known pizzas
Cost of the other two pizzas = 64 - 60
Cost of the other two pizzas = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the cost by 2 to find the cost of one pizza.

Cost of one pizza = Cost of the other two pizzas / 2
Cost of one pizza = 4 / 2
Cost of one pizza = 2 dollars

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on usual days and the extra days to get the total number of times they ride in a week: 15 + 12 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's break down the information given:

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.

After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. The number of orange fish he bought would be 2x (since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish).

The total number of fish in the pet store tank was 17. Since the fish in the pet store tank were a mix of white and orange, we can set up an equation based on the fact that the total number of fish he bought is 17.

The total number of white fish he bought is x, and the total number of orange fish he bought is 2x. So, the equation becomes: x + 2x = 17.

Combine like terms: 3x = 17.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 17 / 3.

x = 5.67 (round down to 5 since you can't buy a fraction of a fish)

However, since the number of fish must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the equation. The total number of fish he bought is 17, and we know that the number of orange fish he bought is 2x. Since 2x must be a whole number, x must be a whole number as well.

Let's re-evaluate the equation: x + 2x = 17.

Combine like terms: 3x = 17.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 17 / 3.

x = 5.67 (round down to 5 since you can't buy a fraction of a fish)

However, if x = 5, then 2x = 10, and the total number of fish he bought would be 5 + 10 = 15, which is less than 17. This means that x cannot be 5.

Let's try x = 6. If x = 6, then 2x = 12, and the total number of fish he bought would be 6 + 12 = 18, which is more than 17. This means that x cannot be 6.

Let's try x = 5.67 (round up to 6 since you can't buy a fraction of a fish) is incorrect, but x = 5.67 (round down to 5) is also incorrect, so we try x = 5.67 (round up to 6) is incorrect, but x =

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total miles driven per week and then multiply it by the fuel efficiency and the price of gas.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per week:
- Distance to work: 5 miles (one way)
- Since it's a round trip, the total distance per day is: 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles
- Total miles driven per week: 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles/week

Now, let's calculate the total gallons of gas consumed per week:
- Fuel efficiency: 10 MPG
- Total miles driven per week: 50 miles
- Total gallons consumed per week: 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week

Finally, let's calculate the total money spent on gas per week:
- Price of gas: $3/gallon
- Total gallons consumed per week: 5 gallons
- Total money spent per week: 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15/week

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent, then add them together.

First, let's find the value of the quarters. Carrie was given 140 quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25. 

Value of quarters = 140 * $0.25 = $35

Next, let's find the value of the twenties she spent. Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. 

Number of twenties spent = 10 * (3/5) = 6

Value of twenties spent = 6 * $20 = $120

Now, let's add the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties to find the total amount of money she paid for lunch.

Total amount spent = $35 + $120 = $155

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to find the total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED TVs, we subtract the total number of smart and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

The number of OLED TVs sold is 25."
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first determine how much the school will cover. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we can calculate this as:

Half of $300 = $300 / 2 = $150

The school will cover $150, and John has $50. To find out how much John is missing, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost of the trip minus the amount the school will cover:

Total cost of the trip = $300
Amount the school will cover = $150
Amount John has = $50

Amount John is missing = Total cost of the trip - Amount the school will cover - Amount John has
= $300 - $150 - $50
= $100

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature at night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night. So, the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house to at least 32 degrees. 

To find out how many degrees Carson needs to heat the house, we subtract the temperature at night from the temperature at which the pipes will freeze: 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we divide the number of degrees he needs to heat the house by the number of degrees each log heats the house: 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of seashells, we first need to find the number of groups and then the number of groups that brought back seashells. 

First, we find the number of groups: 
Number of people = 90
Number of people per group = 9
Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Next, we find the number of groups that brought back seashells:
Fraction of groups that brought back seashells = 3/5
Number of groups that brought back seashells = Number of groups * Fraction of groups that brought back seashells
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 6

Now, we find the total number of seashells:
Number of seashells per group = 2
Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total number of seashells = 6 * 2
Total number of seashells = 12

"To find the number of people on the train, we need to subtract the people who got off and add the people who got on.

Initially, there were 172 people on the train.

At the first stop, 47 people got off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
172 - 47 = 125

Then, 13 people got on, so we add 13 to 125:
125 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people got off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
138 - 38 = 100

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

"To find out how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to multiply the number of bottle caps he finds per day by the value of each bottle cap and then multiply that by the number of days in the month.

Number of bottle caps per day: 10
Value of each bottle cap: $0.25
Number of days in the month: 30

First, multiply the number of bottle caps per day by the value of each bottle cap:
10 * $0.25 = $2.50 per day

Then, multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in the month:
$2.50 * 30 = $75

So, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month."

Price after discount = Original price - Discount
Price after discount = $40 - $10
Price after discount = $30

Now, let's find the amount Mike will have left over:
Amount left over = $50 - $30
Amount left over = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total salary for each month, then multiply it by 3.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After 3 months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (hired in the first month) + 20 (hired in the second month) + 20 (hired in the third month) = 260 employees

The total salary for each month is the number of employees multiplied by the salary per employee:
200 employees * $4000 = $800,000 per month

Since the company pays this amount every month for 3 months, the total amount paid is:
$800,000 * 3 = $2,400,000

The final answer is: $2,400,000"
"To find the total time the choir will be caroling, we need to add the time it takes to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and the time it takes to sing ""Jingle Bells"" once.

Time for ""Deck the Halls"" = 150 seconds
Time for ""Jingle Bells"" = 240 seconds

Total time for ""Deck the Halls"" = 2 * 150 seconds = 300 seconds
Total time for ""Jingle Bells"" = 240 seconds

Total caroling time = Total time for ""Deck the Halls"" + Total time for ""Jingle Bells""
Total caroling time = 300 seconds + 240 seconds
Total caroling time = 540 seconds

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial pay rate is $10 per hour. After 2 months, he gets a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new pay rate $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After another year, he gets a raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final pay rate $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Billy's total earnings for 20 hours of work at $10 per hour is 20 * $10 = $200. His total earnings for 20 hours of work at $10.50 per hour is 20 * $10.50 = $210. His total earnings for 20 hours of work at $11.50 per hour is 20 * $11.50 = $230.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, which is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. So, Sally's starting salary is $10.50 per hour. 

Sally's total earnings for 20 hours of work at $10.50 per hour is 20 * $10.50 = $210. 

Now, let's calculate the difference in their earnings. Billy's total earnings for 20 hours of work is $230, and Sally's total earnings for 20 hours of work is $210. 

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the cost of 3 loaves of bread, we multiply the cost of 1 loaf by 3. 
3 loaves of bread cost 3 x $2 = $6.

To find the cost of 2 bagels, we multiply the cost of 1 bagel by 2. 
2 bagels cost 2 x $1 = $2.

Now, we subtract the cost of 2 bagels from the cost of 3 loaves of bread to find the difference.
$6 - $2 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To find Nikita's score, we need to calculate half of Pierson's score and add 11. 

Pierson's score is 278. Half of 278 is 278 / 2 = 139. 
Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, so Nikita's score is 139 + 11 = 150.

Now, we need to add Pierson's and Nikita's scores to find the total. 
Pierson's score is 278 and Nikita's score is 150. 
Total score = 278 + 150 = 428.

The final answer is: 428"
"To find the total number of trees planted by the students, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of students per class and then multiply the result by 1 (since each student plants 1 tree).

Total students = 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students
Total trees planted by students = 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

To find the total number of trees planted by the teachers, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of teachers per class and then multiply the result by 2 (since each teacher plants 2 trees).

Total teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers
Total trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Total trees planted = Total trees planted by students + Total trees planted by teachers
Total trees planted = 1000 + 240
Total trees planted = 1240

"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal together.

Number of stuffed puppies = 3
Number of stuffed koalas = 5
Number of stuffed zebras = 2
Number of stuffed frogs = 4

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find the number of stuffed goats that will make up 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Let's represent the number of stuffed goats as 'x'. We can set up the equation:

(x + 14) / 14 = 0.3

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by 14:

x + 14 = 4.2

Now, we subtract 14 from both sides:

x = 4.2 - 14
x = -9.8

However, we cannot have a negative number of stuffed animals. This means that Bubbles already has more than 14 stuffed animals, and 30% of 14 is less than 14. We need to recalculate the number of stuffed animals she needs to have in order to buy enough stuffed goats to make up 30% of the total.

Let's represent the total number of stuffed animals as 'y'. We can set up the equation:

0.3y = x (where x is the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy)

Since we don't know the value of 'x', we can represent it as a percentage of the total number of stuffed animals. We know that 30% of the total number of stuffed animals is equal to the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. 

Let's represent the number of stuffed animals she needs to buy as 'x'. We can set up the equation:

x = 0.3y

We know that the total number of stuffed animals will be the sum of the current number of stuffed animals and the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. We can set up the equation:

y = 14 + x

Now, we can substitute the expression for 'x' into the equation for 'y':

y = 14 + 0.3y

Now, we can subtract 0.3y from both sides:

0.7y = 14

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.7:

y = 14 / 0.7
y = 20

Now that we know the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles needs to have, we can find the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy:

x = 0.3y
x = 0.3 * 20
x = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in 2 weeks and 1 week.

In 2 weeks, there are 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in 2 weeks.

In 1 week, there are 7 days. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in 1 week.

Total hours Kris has played = 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours she has played from the target hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between the two distances.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 70 miles/hour x 2 hours = 140 miles

The difference in distance between the two cars is:
Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car."
"To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the diamond and the gold, then add the 30% premium.

Cost of diamond: $600
Cost of gold: $300
Total cost of diamond and gold: $600 + $300 = $900

The premium is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold, which is 0.3 * $900 = $270.

Total cost with premium: $900 + $270 = $1170

The final answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340, and the total number of third-graders is 500. 

The number of fourth-graders who passed is 40, and the total number of fourth-graders is 100.

The number of fifth-graders who passed is 2 times the number of fourth-graders who passed, which is 2 * 40 = 80. The total number of fifth-graders is 400.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school:
Total students who passed = 340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460
Total students in the school = 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students in the school, multiplied by 100 to get the percentage:
Overall pass rate = (460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%

The final answer is: 46"
"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to find out how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and he has 2 bags of glass chips, we need to find out how many chips he has in total. 

Each bag holds 72 chips, so 2 bags will hold 2 x 72 = 144 chips.

Now, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of chips needed to make one square inch of the mosaic. 

144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches.

Since the mosaic is three inches tall, and it's a square mosaic, we need to find the length of the mosaic. 

To do this, we need to find the square root of the total square inches of the mosaic. 

Square root of 12 square inches = √12 ≈ 3.46 inches.

However, since the question asks for the length of the mosaic, we need to consider the width of the mosaic as well. Since the height is 3 inches, and it's a square mosaic, the width will also be 3 inches.

So, the length of the mosaic will be the square root of the total square inches, which is approximately 3.46 inches. But since the width is 3 inches, the length will be the square root of 12, which is approximately 3.46 inches."
"To find the total amount of tea left, we need to calculate the total amount of tea drank by the students. 

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea drank by all students is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party in gallons is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to first determine how many candies he has in total. 

Dale initially ordered 100 candies and then sold 150. So, he had 100 - 150 = -50 candies left. However, this is not possible since you can't have a negative number of candies. This means he must have ordered more candies to sell. 

Dale then ordered 100 more candies. So, the total number of candies he has now is 100 (initial) + 100 (additional) = 200 candies.

Since he sold 150 candies, he still needs to sell 200 - 150 = 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the number of students at the end of May, we need to calculate the number of times the initial number of students doubles in a year. 

Since there are 12 months in a year, the number of students doubles 12 times. 

Initial number of students = 10
Doubling 10 for 12 times:
- Month 1: 10 * 2 = 20
- Month 2: 20 * 2 = 40
- Month 3: 40 * 2 = 80
- Month 4: 80 * 2 = 160
- Month 5: 160 * 2 = 320
- Month 6: 320 * 2 = 640
- Month 7: 640 * 2 = 1280
- Month 8: 1280 * 2 = 2560
- Month 9: 2560 * 2 = 5120
- Month 10: 5120 * 2 = 10240
- Month 11: 10240 * 2 = 20480
- Month 12: 20480 * 2 = 40960

Now, to find the number of additional students by the end of May, we need to find the number of students at the end of May and subtract the initial number of students.
Number of students at the end of May = 320
Initial number of students = 10
Additional students = 320 - 10 = 310

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (5 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 x 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 x 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used and the ones dropped from the total number of marshmallows in the bag.

Total marshmallows in the bag = 35
Marshmallows used by John = 9
Marshmallows used by DeSean = 9
Total marshmallows used = 9 + 9 = 18
Marshmallows dropped = 3
Total marshmallows used and dropped = 18 + 3 = 21
Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14

Now, to find out how many S'mores each kid can make with the remaining marshmallows, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 (since there are 2 kids).

Total marshmallows left = 14
Number of kids = 2
Marshmallows per kid = 14 / 2 = 7

"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the total time played by each person and then multiply it by the cost per minute. 

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. 
Two of his friends can play for half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. 
One of his friends can play for 1.5 times as long, so he can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter.

The total time played is 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Jack's total time played is 240 minutes. 
The two friends who play for 10 minutes per quarter will play for 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. 
The friend who plays for 30 minutes per quarter will play for 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 1 (Jack) + 24 (first friend) + 24 (second friend) + 8 (third friend) = 57 quarters.

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total amount of money used is 57 * 0.25 = $14.25.

"Let's break down the information given:

- The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces.
- The amount of citrus zest is equal to the amount of fragrance.
- The amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x. 
Since the amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, the amount of salt is 2x.
Since the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total amount of the mixture is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: 
x (citrus zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces.

Combine like terms: 
8x = 10

Divide both sides by 8: 
x = 10 / 8
x = 1.25

Since the amount of oil is 4x, the amount of oil is 4 * 1.25 = 5 ounces.

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cars Joe has initially, then calculate the number of cars he sells and gives away, and finally subtract that from the initial number of cars he had.

Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

He gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, which is 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

So, in total, Joe gives away 8 (sold) + 16 (given away) = 24 cars.

To find out how many cars Joe remains with, we subtract the number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine how much money the students raised in total. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the students raised $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we know that there are 20 students and they all raised the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the number of students: $125,000 / 20 = $6,250.

"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first find the total number of cars in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break.

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When he got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 of the cars had gone. So, the number of cars that left is 1/2 * 70 = 35.

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot is 70 - 35 = 35.

Now, we need to find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break. This is the number of cars that arrived during the first break (20) plus the number of cars that were already there (50) minus the number of cars that left (35).

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 20 + 50 - 35 = 35.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, Smendrick has 3x cards, and Becca has 3x + 12 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has by substituting x = 47 into the expression 3x + 12:

Becca has 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs.

She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars.
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we subtract the production of the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production of the fourth week:

- Time spent on recording videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes = 72 minutes

Total time spent on TikTok in a week = 120 + 90 + 72 = 282 minutes

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4:
282 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1128 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
1128 minutes / 60 = 18.8 hours

The final answer is: 18.8"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. Angela has additional items to be installed: 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. 

First, let's find out how many additional items Angela has in total: 6 (mirrors) + 2 (chandeliers) + 20 (pictures) = 28 items.

The cost of the initial installation is $129.00. The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item, so the total cost of the additional items is 28 * $15.00 = $420.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $420.00 = $549.00.

The final answer is: $549.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30.00 by 0.4: $30.00 * 0.4 = $12.00.
4. To find the total amount Roy has saved, we add the 40% more to Anthony's savings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to find out how high Saskay can lift a mountain, then multiply it by 12, then multiply that by 4, and finally multiply that by 10.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total distance traveled by Mason, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance covered in the first 4 hours + Distance covered in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total distance = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, one kangaroo would take 18 * 3 = 54 hours to travel across the highway.

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, if one kangaroo takes 54 hours, one turtle would take 54 * 2 = 108 hours to travel across the highway.

Since there are four turtles, and they are traveling at the same speed, we need to divide the time it takes for one turtle by 4 to find the time it takes for all four turtles. 

Time for four turtles = 108 / 4 = 27 hours.

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's break down the information given:

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's help. 

First, let's calculate the price of the new laptop after trading in her old one: 
Original price - discount = new price
$600 - $200 = $400

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Erika has: 
She already has some savings in her purse, but we don't know the amount yet. 
She received $150 from her part-time job.
Her mom gave her $80.

Total money Erika has = money in purse + $150 + $80

We know that after receiving this money, she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop. 
So, the total money she has = price of the new laptop - $50
Total money Erika has = $400 - $50
Total money Erika has = $350

Now, let's find the money in her purse:
Money in purse + $150 + $80 = $350
Money in purse = $350 - $150 - $80
Money in purse = $120

3 large apples can be sliced into 3 x 5 = 15 slices.
5 small apples can be sliced into 5 x 3 = 15 slices.

Total number of slices = 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
30 (total slices) - 15 (eaten slices) = 15 slices.

"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to find out how many cows he needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day with the current milk production rate.

The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow. To find out how many cows he needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can divide 25 by 5.

25 / 5 = 5

So, the farmer needs 5 cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. Since he already has 3 cows, we need to find out how many more cows he needs.

5 (total cows needed) - 3 (current cows) = 2

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of each used part and subtract it from the original length of the glue stick.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the used part is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6. The length of the used part is 5/6 * 12 = 10 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the used part is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. The length of the used part is 1/3 * 12 = 4 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the used part is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. The length of the used part is 1/2 * 12 = 6 millimeters.

Now, let's calculate the total length of the used parts: 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks is 3 * 12 = 36 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 36 - 20 = 16 millimeters.

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, but we don't know the number of socks Jack has yet.
3. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, which means Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.
4. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Now, we know Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes. Peter has 30 dishes and an unknown number of socks. Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.

The total number of socks is 30 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Peter's socks) = 90 socks.
The total number of dishes is 60 (Jack's dishes) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 90 dishes.

"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time available for performances and then divide it by the time each group takes to perform, including getting on and off the stage.

The total time for each group is 2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit the stage = 10 minutes.

The total time available for performances is the total time of the concert minus the intermission time. The concert is 2 hours long, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. The intermission is 10 minutes. So, the total time available for performances is 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

"Let's denote my age as 'M', my brother's age as 'B', and my sister's age as 'S'. 

Since I am three years younger than my brother, we can write the equation: M = B - 3.

I am 2 years older than my sister, so we can write the equation: M = S + 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so we can write the equation: M's mom = 3B - 1.

The sum of all our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: M + B + S + M's mom = 87.

We can substitute the first two equations into the last equation: (B - 3) + B + (S + 2) + (3B - 1) = 87.

Combine like terms: 5B + S - 2 = 87.

We can also substitute the first equation into the second equation: (B - 3) = S + 2.

Solve for S: S = B - 5.

Now substitute S into the previous equation: 5B + (B - 5) - 2 = 87.

Combine like terms: 6B - 7 = 87.

Add 7 to both sides: 6B = 94.

Divide by 6: B = 94 / 6 = 15.67.

Since age cannot be a fraction, we will round down to the nearest whole number. However, we need to check if this value of B will give us a valid solution for S and M.

B = 15, S = B - 5 = 10, M = B - 3 = 12.

M's mom = 3B - 1 = 3(15) - 1 = 44.

M + B + S + M's mom = 12 + 15 + 10 + 44 = 81.

Since 81 is not equal to 87, we need to try another value of B.

B = 16, S = B - 5 = 11, M = B - 3 = 13.

M's mom = 3B - 1 = 3(16) - 1 = 47.

M + B + S + M's mom = 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87.

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each person would be:
- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:

"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we first need to find the number of silver coins. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and Gretchen has 70 gold coins, we can set up an equation to find the number of silver coins. Let's call the number of silver coins 'x'. 

The equation would be: x + (x + 30) = 70 (since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins)

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 70

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20

So Gretchen has 20 silver coins. 

Now, to find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins: 70 (gold coins) + 20 (silver coins) = 90

"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We know that S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
We also know that A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get S = (F - 12) + 25
S = F + 13

We also know that S + A + F = 85 (Together, they have 85 books)

Substituting the first equation into this equation, we get (F + 13) + A + F = 85
Combine like terms: 2F + A + 13 = 85

Substituting the second equation into this equation, we get 2F + (F - 12) + 13 = 85

24 + 10 + 14 = 48

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda, we need to divide the total cost of 7 bottles of soda by 7 and then multiply it by 3. 

Cost of 7 bottles of soda: $21.00
Cost of 1 bottle of soda: $21.00 / 7 = $3.00
Cost of 3 bottles of soda: $3.00 * 3 = $9.00

To find the cost of 2 bottles of water, we need to divide the total cost of 4 bottles of water by 4 and then multiply it by 2.

Cost of 4 bottles of water: $8.00
Cost of 1 bottle of water: $8.00 / 4 = $2.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water: $2.00 * 2 = $4.00

Now, we add the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water to find the total cost.

Total cost: $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

The final answer is: $13.00"
"To find out how much money David has left, we need to subtract the cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the bolts:
16 bolts * $0.03 per bolt = $0.48

Now, let's subtract the cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:
$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

So, David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to first find out her rate of earning per hour. 

Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of dog walking. 

Rate = Total Earnings / Total Hours
Rate = $33 / 3 hours
Rate = $11 per hour

Now, we can multiply her rate by the total hours she will work to find her total earnings.

Total Earnings = Rate * Total Hours
Total Earnings = $11 per hour * 12 hours
Total Earnings = $132

The final answer is: $132"
"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the steps:

1. Paul starts with 52 marbles.
2. His friend gave him 28 marbles, so now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.
3. He lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 80 by 4. 80 / 4 = 20.
4. So, Paul lost 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract 20 from 80. 80 - 20 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she gets from each type of question and add them together.

Multiple-choice questions: 10 questions * 80% * 1 point = 8 points
True/false questions: 20 questions * 90% * 1 point = 18 points
Long-answer questions: 5 questions * 60% * 5 points = 15 points

Now, let's add the points together: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41

The final answer is: 41"
"To find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell, we need to calculate 3/5 of 300. 

3/5 * 300 = (3 * 300) / 5
= 900 / 5
= 180

Since Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each, we need to find the total amount he will get from selling these chickens.

Total amount = Number of chickens * Price per chicken
= 180 * 50
= 9000

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we need to find the cost price of the chickens. 

Cost price = Total amount - Profit
= 9000 - 2000
= 7000

So, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000. 

The final answer is: $7000"
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 2, since they sold an equal number of glasses. 

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people who sold an equal number of glasses = 2 (Micah and Mitchell)
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16

Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah. 
Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 16
Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah = 14 - 16 = -2

The final answer is: $\boxed{-2}$"
"To find out how much Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure first.

Let's start with the cost of the manicure. Since Iris spent 1/4 as much on the manicure as she did on her hair, and she spent $400 on her hair, the cost of the manicure is 1/4 * 400 = $100.

Now, let's find the cost of the pedicure. Since Iris spent 3/4 as much on the pedicure as she did on the manicure, and the manicure cost $100, the cost of the pedicure is 3/4 * 100 = $75.

Now, we can add up the costs of the hair, manicure, and pedicure to find the total amount Iris spent at the spa: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The final answer is: $575"
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to first calculate how much money she will get from selling the rope. 

The rope is 20 meters long, and her friend wants to buy it for $2 a meter. So, the total amount she will get is 20 * $2 = $40.

Now, she plans to use this money to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 a meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we divide the total amount she has by the cost per meter of the new rope: $40 / $1.5 = 26.67 meters.

Since she can't buy a fraction of a meter, we'll round down to 26 meters. 

Now, we need to find out how much she will spend on the new rope: 26 * $1.5 = $39.

Finally, to find out how much money she will have left over, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount she got from selling the old rope: $40 - $39 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years. This means her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

Let's assume Melanie's age in x years will be thrice her present age. So, her age in x years will be 3 * 8 = 24 years.

Since Melanie's current age is 8, we can set up the equation: 8 + x = 24.

To find the value of x, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: x = 24 - 8
x = 16

So, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age in 16 years.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

The cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10.
The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 * 2 * $10 = $120, since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.
The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 * $2 = $14, since each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
$10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156

However, this is the total cost of the items, not the total cost of the packs. Since Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, 6 packets of chicken, 3 packs of strawberries, and 7 packs of apples, we need to find the total number of items she has. 
5 (bacon) + 6 (chicken) + 3 (strawberries) + 7 (apples) = 21 items

Since each pack of bacon contains 1 item, each packet of chicken contains 1 item, each pack of strawberries contains 1 item, and each pack of apples contains 1 item, the total cost of the items is the same as the total cost of the packs, which is $156.

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the items from Kelly's budget:
$65 - $156 = -$91

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means that Kelly's budget is not enough to cover the cost of the items in her cart. 

But, if we assume that Kelly has enough money to buy the items, then we can calculate the amount of money she has left in her budget after buying the items. In this case, we will use the total cost of the packs, not the total cost of the items.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts.
2. The final concert has a 15-minute encore.
3. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

Let's denote the runtime of her usual concerts as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, its runtime is 2x.

The total runtime of the final concert is the sum of the runtime of the main concert and the encore, which is 2x + 15 = 65.

Now, let's solve for x:

2x + 15 = 65

Subtract 15 from both sides:
2x = 50

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 25

So, her usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he had initially.

Argo initially had 200 toys. He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. 

First, let's add the number of toys he gave away: 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Now, let's subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys: 200 - 150 = 50

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

Let's assume the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is x. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the total number of microphones arranged in pairs is 2x.

However, the singer has 50 microphones in total. Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in, the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 80% of 50, which is 0.8 * 50 = 40.

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs is 40 / 2 = 20.

"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, Jerry counts 6 birds in the bushes.

Then, 2/3 of 6 is 4, so 2/3rd of the number of birds flying overhead is 4. This means there are 4 birds flying overhead.

Next, Jerry sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, the total number of birds feeding is 3 x 8 = 24.

Now, let's add the number of birds in each group: 6 (in the bushes) + 4 (flying overhead) + 24 (feeding) = 34.

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants.
Number of outdoor plants = 75 * (2/3) = 50

Number of flowering plants = 75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.
Percentage of flowering plants = (25/100) * 100 = 25%

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up an equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which is five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

"Let's break down the information given:

- Ellen eats 2 carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day.
- The salad costs $6.
- The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.
- The total cost of Ellen's daily goods is $11.

We know that the total cost is the sum of the cost of 2 carrots, the salad, and the yogurt. Let's represent the cost of one carrot as 'x'. Then, the cost of 2 carrots is 2x.

The total cost equation is: 2x + 6 (salad) + 3 (yogurt) = 11

Combine the constants: 2x + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides: 2x = 2

"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Tasha made $80 in total from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.
2. She made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn.
3. The number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is three times the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn.
4. The number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is five times the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn.

Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. Then, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is 3x, and the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is 5x.

Since we know she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and she made the same amount for each lawn, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x.

We know that the total amount she made from mowing lawns and selling lemonade is $80. So, we can set up the equation:

54x + (amount from lemonade) = 80

We don't know the amount from lemonade, but we can represent it as 'L'. So, the equation becomes:

54x + L = 80

We also know that the total amount she made from mowing lawns is $54x. Since she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, we can set up the equation:

6 + 18x + 30x = 54x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

48x = 54x - 6

Subtracting 48x from both sides, we get:

6 = 6x

Dividing both sides by 6, we get:

x = 1

Now that we know x = 1, we can find the total amount she made from mowing lawns:

54x = 54(1) = 54

Since the total amount she made from mowing lawns and selling lemonade is $80, we can find the amount from lemonade:

L = 80 - 54
L = 26

The final answer is: $26"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to find Christian's weight first, then subtract 5 kg from it.

Martin's weight is 55 kg.
Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Martha initially had some notebooks, but we don't know the exact number. However, we know that after buying 5 more notebooks, she had a total of 7 notebooks. This means she initially had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, and Martha initially had 2 notebooks, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. So, Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today.

So, Denise read a total of 10 + 18 = 28 pages, and Daniel read a total of 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the number of pages Daniel read from the number of pages Denise read: 28 - 13 = 15.

"To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we first need to determine how many bowls of soup are left after dinner. 

Since Calvin, his wife, and their two children are eating dinner, that's a total of 3 adults and 2 children, which equals 5 people. 

Each adult can eat one bowl, so the adults will eat 3 bowls. Each child can also eat one bowl, so the children will eat 2 bowls. 

In total, 3 + 2 = 5 bowls will be eaten for dinner. 

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child's bowls. Since 5 bowls were eaten for dinner, we need to find out how many bowls the pot can fill in terms of child's bowls. 

Since 4 adult bowls equal 8 child's bowls, we can say that 1 adult bowl equals 2 child's bowls. 

So, 5 bowls (eaten for dinner) in terms of child's bowls is 5 * 2 = 10 child's bowls. 

Since the pot can fill 8 child's bowls, and 10 child's bowls were eaten for dinner, there are 8 child's bowls left. 

To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we divide the remaining child's bowls by the number of children. 

8 child's bowls / 2 children = 4 times.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. 
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours a day.
He walks his dog for 1 hour a day.

Total hours spent on these activities: 10 (sleep) + 8 (work) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours

Free time left in a day = Total hours in a day - Total hours spent on activities

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Adam's age four years ago be x. 

Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write the equation: 
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
(60 - 8) = 2 * (x - 4)
52 = 2x - 8

Now, let's solve for x:
52 + 8 = 2x
60 = 2x
x = 60 / 2
x = 30

So, Adam's age four years ago was 30. 

Now, let's find Adam's current age:
Adam's current age = x + 4
Adam's current age = 30 + 4
Adam's current age = 34

In 8 years, Adam's age will be:
Adam's age in 8 years = Adam's current age + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 34 + 8

"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku and then divide it by the time it takes to drink one bottle of water.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so an extreme sudoku takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to convert the time from minutes to half hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 2 half hours in an hour. 

180 minutes is equal to 180 / 30 = 6 half hours.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, he drinks 6 bottles of water in 6 half hours.

- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
- Total bologna thrown = 58
- Number of red balloons = 20

First, let's find the total number of bologna thrown at red balloons:
2 pieces/balloon * 20 balloons = 40 pieces

Now, subtract the bologna thrown at red balloons from the total to find the bologna thrown at yellow balloons:
58 - 40 = 18 pieces

Since each yellow balloon gets 3 pieces of bologna, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the total bologna thrown at yellow balloons by 3:
18 / 3 = 6

So, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

Lana has 27 cups of tea in total. She divides these into 3 rows. 

To find out how many cups are in each row, we divide 27 by 3:
27 / 3 = 9

So, there are 9 cups in each row. Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row is half of 9.

9 / 2 = 4.5

Since you can't have half a cup, this means that Lana must have 4 full cups of mint tea in each row and 5 full cups of chamomile tea in each row, and then she uses the remaining 3 cups to brew cinnamon tea.

- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Money left: $150 - $130 = $20

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 and he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can see 1 more movie on a Friday or Saturday. 

Now, let's calculate how much money is left for other days: $20 - $10 = $10

Tickets for other days cost $7, so he can see $10 / $7 = 1.4286 (round down to 1) more movie on other days.

"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and John's age as J. 

We are given that Pp = J + 10. 
We are also given that P = Pp + J. 
We are also given that P + Pp + J = 100.

Substituting Pp = J + 10 into the equation P = Pp + J, we get P = (J + 10) + J, which simplifies to P = 2J + 10.

Substituting P = 2J + 10 and Pp = J + 10 into the equation P + Pp + J = 100, we get (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100.

Simplifying the equation, we get 4J + 20 = 100.

Subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation, we get 4J = 80.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 4, we get J = 20.

Now that we know J = 20, we can find Pp by substituting J into the equation Pp = J + 10, which gives Pp = 20 + 10 = 30.

Finally, we can find P by substituting Pp into the equation P = Pp + J, which gives P = 30 + 20 = 50.

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine:

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Now, let's find the difference in revenue:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The final answer is: $64,800"
"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay with the two options and then find the difference.

Option 1: 24-hour stay - 1600 pesos
Option 2: 12-hour stay (1000 pesos) + additional hours

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is 17 hours. Since the first 12 hours are already included in the 1000 pesos, we need to calculate the cost of the additional 5 hours.

5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay with the additional hours is 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's find the difference between the two options:
Difference = 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos

Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing the option of adding 70 pesos for every additional hour after the 12-hour mark."
"To find out how much hay each sheep needs, we need to calculate twice the amount each goat needs and then subtract 3 pounds. 

Twice the amount each goat needs is 2 * 5 = 10 pounds. 
3 pounds less than that is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep. 

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds.
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds.

The total amount of hay needed is 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The final answer is: 159"
"To find out how much money John has left after buying gas and depositing money in the bank, we first need to calculate his total earnings. 

John's total earnings = 50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars.

Now, let's subtract the cost of gas and the money he wants to deposit in the bank from his total earnings. 

Money left after gas and deposit = 300 dollars - 50 dollars - 100 dollars = 150 dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pencils. 

Cost of pencils = 5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars.

Now, let's subtract the cost of pencils from the money left after gas and deposit. 

Money left after pencils = 150 dollars - 50 dollars = 100 dollars.

Finally, let's calculate how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money. 

Number of pens = 100 dollars / 25 dollars = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 20 * 15 = 300.

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled is 300 + 50 = 350.

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 300 + 350 = 650.

The final answer is: 650"
"To find the total number of children, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows and then multiply the result by the number of schools.

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to first calculate the total number of bottles she gives to the students. 

There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58.

The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she gets is 9 * 100 = 900.

Now, to find out how many bottles she has left, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she got. 

900 - 58 = 842

The final answer is: 842"
"To find the total charge, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the parts cost and the initial visit charge.

Labor cost = $35 per hour * 2.25 hours = $78.75
Parts cost = $60
Initial visit charge = $40

Total charge = Labor cost + Parts cost + Initial visit charge
Total charge = $78.75 + $60 + $40
Total charge = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To find out how much James paid for the CDs, we need to calculate the original price and then apply the 40% discount.

Original price of 10 CDs = 10 * $15 = $150
Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60
Price after discount = $150 - $60 = $90

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each, so he made a total of:
5 * $40 = $200

Since he paid $90 for the CDs and made $200 from selling 5 of them, we need to find out how much he paid for the remaining 5 CDs. 
Price of 5 CDs = $90 - $200 = -$110 (This is incorrect, as you can't pay money for something. We need to recalculate the price of the 5 CDs he kept.)

Price of 10 CDs = $90
Price of 5 CDs he kept = 5/10 * $90 = $45
Price of 5 CDs he sold = $200
Price of 1 CD = $200 / 5 = $40

Now, let's find the price of the 5 CDs he sold at the discounted price:
Discounted price of 1 CD = $15 - (40% of $15) = $15 - $6 = $9
Price of 5 CDs at discounted price = 5 * $9 = $45

Since he sold the 5 CDs for $40 each, he made a loss of:
Loss = $45 - $40 * 5 = $45 - $200 = -$155 (This is incorrect, as you can't lose money for selling something. We need to recalculate the loss.)

"To find the time James took to swim 60% of the distance, we first need to find 60% of 20 miles. 

60% of 20 miles = 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, James has to swim the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. He swims at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

Time taken to swim the remaining distance = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

Total time taken = Time to swim 12 miles + Time to rest + Time to swim the remaining distance
Total time taken = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time taken = 17 hours

"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D. 

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. 

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can set A + 20 = D + 10. 

We also know that B + A + D = 45. 

We can substitute B = A + 20 into the equation B + A + D = 45, which gives us (A + 20) + A + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2A + D + 20 = 45. 

We can also substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B + A + D = 45, which gives us (D + 10) + A + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2D + A + 10 = 45. 

Now we have two equations: 2A + D + 20 = 45 and 2D + A + 10 = 45. 

We can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate A: (2A + D + 20) - (2D + A + 10) = 45 - 45. 

This simplifies to A - D + 10 = 0. 

We can rearrange the equation to get A - D = -10. 

Now we can add D to both sides to get A = D - 10. 

We can substitute A = D - 10 into the equation B = A + 20, which gives us B = (D - 10) + 20. 

This simplifies to B = D + 10. 

We know that B = D + 10 and B + A + D = 45. 

We can substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B + A + D = 45, which gives us (D + 10) + A + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2D + A + 10 = 45. 

We can substitute A = D - 10 into the equation 2D + A + 10 = 45, which gives us 2D + (D - 10) + 10 = 45. 

This simplifies to 3D = 45. 

We can divide both sides by 3 to get D = 15. 

Now that we know D = 15, we can substitute D = 15 into the equation A = D - 10, which gives us A = 15 - 10. 

This simplifies to A = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since there are 100 pages to the inch and each page is printed on both sides, we have 100 * 2 = 200 pages per inch.

The book is 1.5 inches thick, so we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:

200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked. He worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know he staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the number of reports he staples per minute, we divide 30 by 15.

30 reports / 15 minutes = 2 reports per minute

Now, we multiply the total number of minutes he worked by the number of reports he staples per minute.

900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find the total time Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she usually sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total time she slept on her bed, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from her total sleep time. 

Total sleep time = 480 minutes
Time sleepwalking = 23 minutes
Time slept on bed = Total sleep time - Time sleepwalking
Time slept on bed = 480 - 23
Time slept on bed = 457 minutes

The final answer is: 457"
"To find the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially, we need to first find the number of measuring cups he has. Since he has two dozen cups, we multiply 2 by 12 to get the total number of cups.

2 * 12 = 24 cups

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we multiply the number of cups by 2/3 to find the number of spoons.

24 * (2/3) = 16 spoons

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, we subtract 6 from the total number of spoons to find the remaining number of spoons.

16 - 6 = 10 spoons

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the remaining spoons and the number of cups.

24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the number of occupied beds initially, we need to calculate 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital.

Total capacity = 1000 beds
Occupied beds initially = 1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to find the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is equal to 14 days.

Total patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

Now, we need to find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks. We add the initial occupied beds to the total patients admitted.

Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = 200 beds + 700 patients = 900 beds

Since the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, we can find the total number of unoccupied beds by subtracting the total occupied beds from the total capacity.

Total unoccupied beds = Total capacity - Total occupied beds
= 1000 beds - 900 beds
= 100 beds

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to first find out how many emails are not work-related. 

Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to her family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. So, she sends 6 emails to her family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending emails to her family. 9 - 6 = 3.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.
2. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya.
3. Aliya is 3 years old.

Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old, we can find Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3:
Shawna's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years

Now that we know Shawna's age, we can find her father's age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5:
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9 = 45 years

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number reported by Courtney and subtract it from the number reported by Courtney.

Let's assume the number reported by Courtney is 100%. 
20% of 100 is 20.

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 100 - 20 = 80% of the number reported by Courtney.

Now, we need to find 80% of 48 (the number reported by Courtney). 
80% of 48 = (80/100) * 48 = 0.8 * 48 = 38.4

However, since the number of people cannot be a fraction, we will round down to the nearest whole number. 

The actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.

The final answer is: 38"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Jason carried 2 balls.
- Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jeffrey carried half of what Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.
- Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

To find the total number of balls, we add the number of balls each boy carried: 2 (Jason) + 1 (Jeffrey) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

The total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to first calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes the first day, 13 holes the second day, and 8 holes the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes, so the net number of holes dug on the third day is 8 - 2 = 6 holes.

The total number of holes by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

Since there were 29 holes by the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got as x. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so we can set up the equation:

x = 70

Since Collins got x + 15 corn chips, we can set up the equation:

x + 15 = 70 + 15 (since Collins got 15 more than Amora and Lainey)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 15 = 85

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get:

x = 70

This confirms that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each. Now, we need to find the total number of corn chips. We know that Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got:

Total = x + x + (x + 15)
Total = 2x + (x + 15)
Total = 3x + 15
Total = 3(70) + 15
Total = 210 + 15
Total = 225

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, let's find 50% of the cost of supplies: 
50% of $400 = 0.5 * $400 = $200

Now, let's add this to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel:
Cost of travel = Cost of supplies + 50% of cost of supplies
Cost of travel = $400 + $200
Cost of travel = $600

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L. 

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so A + S + L = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so L = S + 5.

We also know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so S = 4A - 13.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation: A + (S + 5) + S = 339.

This simplifies to A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Now we can substitute the third equation into this one: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.

This simplifies to A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.

Combine like terms: 9A - 21 = 339.

Add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Divide by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to find half of the number of minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, there are 20 minutes per episode. Half of 20 is 10. 

So, there are 10 episodes in total. 

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the southerly direction is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 10 = 300 miles

The bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the northerly direction is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 2 = 36 miles

The bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the southerly direction is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 22 * 5 = 110 miles

The total distance traveled in the southerly direction is 300 + 110 = 410 miles.

Now, subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction:
Total distance = 410 - 36 = 374 miles

Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies. 
She received 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office, which is 6 brownies. 
She received 4 dozen brownies from her friends, which is 48 brownies.

Total brownies received = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66

1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Total brownies left over = Total brownies received - Total brownies eaten

"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we need to multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form).

Nani's sister's age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of all three family members: Nani (8 years), his brother (16 years), and his sister (6 years).

The total age of all three family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).

Given the length of the fence is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first determine how many oranges she had initially and then subtract the ones she kept and gave away.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. So, the total number of oranges she bought is 12 * 20 = 240.

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, which is a total of 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

She kept 1/4 of the oranges. To find out how many oranges that is, we need to divide the total number of oranges by 4. 240 / 4 = 60. So, she kept 60 oranges.

Now, to find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the ones she kept and gave away from the total. 240 - 60 - 80 = 100.

The USA has 50 states.

Let's assume the number of states in India is x. According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, we can write the equation as:
x = (50 / 2) + 4
x = 25 + 4
x = 29

Now, we know the number of states in India is 29. To find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in the USA and India:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard.

Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, we can find out how many cherries Richard has by subtracting 10 from Robert's total:

Richard's cherries = Robert's cherries - 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60, and we have the number of cherries each person has. To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we can subtract the total number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total:

Total cherries = 60
Richard's cherries + Robert's cherries + Jerry's cherries = 60
20 + 30 + Jerry's cherries = 60
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 50
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now, we know that Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries. To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we can subtract Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 20

"Let's break down the information given:

- Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.
- On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so G = 10.
- On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so A = Sunday's apple pie - 4.
- On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so Sunday's gingerbread = G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.
- On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, we can find the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday. 
A = Sunday's apple pie - 4
A = 15 - 4
A = 11

Now, we can find the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on Saturday and Sunday.
- Total boxes of gingerbread sold = G + Sunday's gingerbread = 10 + 15 = 25
- Total boxes of apple pie sold = A + Sunday's apple pie = 11 + 15 = 26

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is 19 years old now.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

From point 3, we can deduce that Emil's brother is currently half of Emil's age when Emil turns 24. Since Emil will be 24, his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old now.

From point 2, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old when Emil turns 24.

Since Emil is 19 now, his dad is 48 - 19 = 29 years old now.

Now, we know Emil's age (19) and his dad's age (29). We also know his brother's age (12). 

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is 29 + 12 = 41.

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to first convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches
111 feet = 111 * 12 = 1332 inches

Now, we need to find the total space taken by the plants and the space between them. 

Let's assume the number of plants is 'n'. The total space taken by the plants is 12n inches. The space between the plants is 1.5 feet = 18 inches. The total space between the plants is (n-1) * 18 inches.

The total length of the flower bed is the sum of the space taken by the plants and the space between them. 

1332 = 12n + 18(n-1)

Simplifying the equation:
1332 = 12n + 18n - 18
1332 = 30n - 18
1332 + 18 = 30n
1350 = 30n
n = 1350 / 30
n = 45

So, Pat can fit 45 plants in her flower bed. However, she already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 45 - 17 = 28 more flowers.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp. 

First, let's find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we can divide 90 by 6 to get the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. 

90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Now, let's find out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide 90 by 30 to find out how many sets of 30 shrimp she needs to cook. 

90 / 30 = 3

Since it takes her 10 minutes to cook one set of 30 shrimp, we can multiply the number of sets by the cooking time. 

3 * 10 = 30 minutes

However, this is the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp, but we also need to add the time it takes to peel the shrimp. 

So, the total time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature. 

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, and the room warmed up by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total warming effect in 2 hours is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is the sum of the cooling effects minus the warming effect: 6 + 12 - 4 = 14 degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature. 

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to first find out how old Bill's dad was when Bill saw the comet for the second time. 

Since Bill saw the comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, let's call the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet ""x"". Then, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is 3x.

We know that 75 years passed between the two sightings. So, the difference in their ages is 75 years. 

Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time minus his dad's age when he saw the comet is 75 years. 
3x - x = 75
2x = 75
x = 37.5

Now that we know Bill's dad was 37.5 years old when he saw the comet, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, so the difference in their ages is 37.5 - 30 = 7.5 years. 

Since Bill was 3 times the age of his dad when he saw the comet for the second time, we can find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time by multiplying 37.5 by 3. 
3 * 37.5 = 112.5

Now, we can find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 7.5 years from 112.5. 
112.5 - 7.5 = 105

The final answer is: 105"
"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and add them together.

1. Checks for the electric bill: 12 months/year * 1 check/month = 12 checks/year
2. Checks for the gas bill: 12 months/year * 1 check/month = 12 checks/year
3. Checks to the church: 12 months/year * 2 checks/month = 24 checks/year
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 quarters/year * 1 check/quarter = 4 checks/year

Now, let's add the total number of checks: 
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks/year

"To find the number of flights to France, we first need to find the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 flights.

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is (3/4) * 88 = 66. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/2) * (88 - 66) = (1/2) * 22 = 11.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

Total money received from parents = $6 + $12 = $18.

Now, subtract the total money received from the cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings:
$30 (cost of trousers) - $18 (total money received) = $12.

"Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. We know that the total age of the children is 20, and Akbar and Alessandro are 3 and 4 years old, respectively. 

The total age of Akbar and Alessandro is 3 + 4 = 7. 

Since the total age of the children is 20, the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 20 - 7 = 13.

We are also given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's denote the average age of the group as A. Then, Helene's age is 2A.

The total age of the group is the sum of the ages of all children, which is A + A + A + 2A = 4A. We know that this is equal to 20.

4A = 20
A = 20 / 4
A = 5

Now that we know the average age of the group is 5, we can find Helene's age, which is 2A = 2 * 5 = 10.

Since the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 13, and Helene is 10 years old, Wilfred's age is 13 - 10 = 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from a fund he set up online. 

Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend gives him $200, but this is not included in the amount that the lawyer will donate based on. 

The lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates, which is $2000. 

So, the lawyer will contribute 3 * $2000 = $6000.

"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to first find out the total number of cookies. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 * 1/2 = 750.

Since each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got. 

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Number of cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

"Let's assume the total number of slices of the watermelon is 6x, where x is a constant. 

Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid, let's say each kid gets 1 slice and each adult gets 2 slices. 

The total number of slices given to the kids is 4 * 1 = 4 slices. 
The total number of slices given to the adults is 2 * 2 = 4 slices.

The total number of slices given out is 4 + 4 = 8 slices.

Since the total number of slices is 6x, we can set up the equation 6x = 8. 

Solving for x, we get x = 8 / 6 = 4/3.

The total number of slices is 6x = 6 * (4/3) = 8.

The number of slices each adult gets is 2, and the total number of slices is 8. 

The percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (2/8) * 100 = 25%.

"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from the total hours he works.

Time spent on rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 180 minutes to hours: 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Converting 300 minutes to hours: 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours

Total hours worked: 9 hours

Time left to update records: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We know that they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation: 
8x = 64

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

The number of chocolate bars in a box is 8."
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, so it is rented 3 * 4 = 12 days in a month (assuming a 4-week month).

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is 25 + (10 * 1.50) = 25 + 15 = $40.

The total cost per session is $40, and the studio is rented 12 times a month, so the total cost of renting the studio per month is 40 * 12 = $480.

The total cost of students per session is $15, and the studio is rented 12 times a month, so the total cost of students per month is 15 * 12 = $180.

The total earnings of the dance studio per month is the total cost of renting the studio plus the total cost of students, which is 480 + 180 = $660.

The final answer is: $660"
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as 'x'. Since Peter has 4 boxes, the total number of chocolate bars he has is 4x. We are given that this total is 64, so we can write the equation:

4x = 64

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 64 / 4
x = 16

Now, let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as 'y'. Since Martha has 7 boxes, the total number of chocolate bars she has is 7y. We are given that this total is 56, so we can write the equation:

7y = 56

To find the value of 'y', we divide both sides of the equation by 7:

y = 56 / 7
y = 8

Now that we know the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes, we can find the difference:

Difference = x - y
= 16 - 8

"To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5. 

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of babies born in a month is 30 * 4 = 120.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the initial population plus the number of babies born in a year. 

Total porcupines = 50 + 1440 = 1490

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed, we do that next.

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon.

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x%.

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is x - 5 * 9 = x - 45%.

In the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining is (x - 45) - 3 * 7 = x - 45 - 21 = x - 66%.

We are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. We can set up the equation:

x - 66 = 28

To solve for x, we add 66 to both sides of the equation:

x = 28 + 66
x = 94

The charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%."
"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and her hourly tips are $15. So, her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Now, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. 

20% of $10,000 is 0.2 * $10,000 = $2000.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000. 

To do this, we divide the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000). 

$2000 / $1000 = 2.

So, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying the other fruits. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he has already purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Now, let's calculate how many plums he can buy with the remaining money:
Plums cost $0.25 each, so the number of plums he can buy is $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. 

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs to her friends.

Since she gave the packs equally to 10 friends, we divide the number of packs by 10: 13 / 10 = 1.3 packs per friend.

Each pack has 60 pieces, so we multiply the number of packs each friend received by the number of pieces in each pack: 1.3 * 60 = 78.

However, since you can't divide a pack into fractions, we can round down to 1 pack per friend and give the remaining packs to the friends with more than 1 pack. 

So, 13 packs / 10 friends = 1 pack per 7 friends and 6 friends with 1 extra pack each. 

7 friends received 1 pack each, so 7 * 60 = 420 pieces. 
6 friends received 2 packs each, so 6 * 120 = 720 pieces. 

Total pieces given to friends = 420 + 720 = 1140. 

Now, to find out how many pieces each of the 6 friends with 2 packs received, we divide the total pieces they received by 6: 720 / 6 = 120.

The 7 friends with 1 pack each received 60 pieces each.

So, the answer is 60 for 7 friends and 120 for 6 friends."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to first find the number of pictures in each album. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8 to find the number of pictures in each album.

So, there are 9 pictures in each album. 

Since 3 albums were selfies only, the total number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27.

Since 2 albums were portraits, the total number of portraits is 2 * 9 = 18.

The total number of portraits and selfies is 27 + 18 = 45.

James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. 
So, the number of pages he reads per minute is 3 / 10 = 0.3 pages per minute.

Since James reads 18 pages, we can find the time he spends reading by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per minute.

Time spent reading = Total number of pages / Number of pages per minute
Time spent reading = 18 / 0.3
Time spent reading = 60 minutes

"To find out how many points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of questions in each category and then find out how many Aries is sure to get from each category.

First, let's find out how many questions are easy, average, and difficult.

Total questions = 60
Easy questions = 40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24
Average and difficult questions = 60 - 24 = 36
Since the rest are equally divided as average and difficult, 
Average questions = 36 / 2 = 18
Difficult questions = 36 / 2 = 18

Now, let's find out how many questions Aries is sure to get from each category.

Easy questions = 24
Aries gets 75% of the easy questions = 0.75 * 24 = 18
Average questions = 18
Aries gets half of the average questions = 18 / 2 = 9
Difficult questions = 18
Aries gets half of the difficult questions = 18 / 2 = 9

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's assume the number of large stuffed animals sold is x.
2. Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x.
3. The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, so the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.
4. The total amount earned from the sales is $120.
5. The total amount earned from the sales can be calculated as the sum of the earnings from large and small stuffed animals: x * $12 + 2x * $4 = $120.
6. Simplifying the equation: 12x + 8x = 120
7. Combining like terms: 20x = 120
8. Solving for x: x = 120 / 20
9. x = 6

Since x represents the number of large stuffed animals sold, and the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2 * 6 = 12.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from selling cupcakes: 
60 cupcakes * $4 = $240

Now, let's add her earnings from cookies and cupcakes: 
$80 + $240 = $320

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave a total of: 
2 * $10 = $20

Now, let's subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total earnings: 
$320 - $20 = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the number of eggs found by the friends, we need to subtract the number of eggs found by the Smith twins and the remaining eggs from the total number of eggs.

Total eggs = 100
Eggs found by the Smith twins = 30 * 2 = 60
Remaining eggs = 10

Eggs found by the friends = Total eggs - (Eggs found by the Smith twins + Remaining eggs)
= 100 - (60 + 10)
= 100 - 70
= 30

"To find out how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to first find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in a day.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. He can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe, so with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day.

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. So, with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Now, we know that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day, we multiply 36 by 40: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds.

Since there are 30 days in a month, we multiply 1440 by 30 to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The ratio for the first package is 3/2, and for the second package is 6/4. We can simplify these ratios to 3/2 and 3/2. 

Since the ratios are the same, the price of the third package with 8 sandwiches will be proportional to the price of the second package. 

The price of the second package is $6 for 4 sandwiches. To find the price per sandwich, we divide the price by the number of sandwiches: 6/4 = 1.5. 

Now, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches in the third package: 1.5 * 8 = 12.

The price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to subtract the amount he paid from the total cost of the bedroom set.

First, let's find out how much Tom paid for the bedroom set after selling his old bedroom set. 
Amount paid = Total cost - Amount received from selling old bedroom set
Amount paid = $3000 - $1000
Amount paid = $2000

Now, we need to find out the monthly payment. 
Monthly payment = Amount paid * (Monthly interest rate)
Monthly payment = $2000 * 0.10
Monthly payment = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 x 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so she released 6 yellow balloons, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 x 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's add up the remaining balloons: 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons. 

15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

The final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 34."
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). 

However, the third scenario is dependent on the second scenario not happening, so we need to multiply the probabilities. 

The probability that the normal teacher doesn't give an extension is 100% - 40% = 60%. 

The probability that Marcus convinces the teacher his dog ate his assignment is 20% of 60%, which is 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12 or 12%.

The total probability that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework is 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since the total probability cannot exceed 100%. 

The correct approach is to find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework. 

The probability that the substitute teacher collects the homework is 50% of 100%, which is 50%. 

The probability that the normal teacher gives no extension is 60% of 50%, which is 0.6 * 0.5 = 0.3 or 30%. 

The probability that Marcus convinces the teacher his dog ate his assignment is 20% of 50%, which is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 or 10%. 

The total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 50% + 30% + 10% = 90%. 

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we need to first find out how many seats are available for guests. 

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300
Total seats taken: 950 + 300 = 1250
Seats available for guests: 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Now, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive. 

Number of graduates: 950
Seats available for guests: 4750
Tickets per graduate: 4750 / 950 = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first find out how many medium-sized beans he can eat, and then find out how many small beans are equivalent to that amount.

Since it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, and he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can set up a proportion to find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. 

Let's say x is the number of small beans equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. Then, 3x = 150 (since 3 small beans = 1 medium-sized bean). 

To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 150 / 3 = 50.

So, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans. 

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses.

Total earnings: Melissa is paid $15 per day for 3 days, so her total earnings are 15 * 3 = $45.

Total expenses: Melissa has to pay $3 for parking each day for 3 days, so her total expenses are 3 * 3 = $9.

Now, let's calculate her net earnings: Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses = 45 - 9 = $36.

Since Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, her total hours worked is 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

To find out her hourly wage after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total hours worked: Hourly wage = Net earnings / Total hours worked = 36 / 18 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils, then add them together.

The cost of the books is 3 * 16 = 48 dollars.

"To find the total number of seconds it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to find the total number of soda bottles he will place and then multiply it by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. 

To find the total number of bottles, we divide the total width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:
24 feet / 3 feet = 8 bottles

Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we multiply the total number of bottles by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next:
8 bottles * 5 seconds = 40 seconds

The total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 40 seconds.

"To find out how many packs Uncle Franky can make, we need to first find out how many apples he has in total. 

He ordered two boxes of apples, and each box has 40 apples. So, the total number of apples is 2 * 40 = 80 apples.

Now, we need to find out how many packs he can make with 80 apples. Each pack has 8 apples. 

To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack: 80 / 8 = 10.

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract that from the initial amount of money she had.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 x $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 x $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor starts with $50, so subtracting the total cost of the cheese from that amount, we get:
$50 - $40 = $10.

So, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and not working while in college. 

The total amount of loans he took is 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000.

The amount of money he lost by not working while in college is 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000.

So, the total amount of money he needs to earn is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After college, his income triples, so he now earns $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

To find out how long it will take him to earn $300,000 at this new income, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to find the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, so the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of one piece of fabric is length * width, so it's 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, he needs 2 * 80 = 160 square feet of fabric.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102. 
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 
5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209. 
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add up the number of letters delivered each day: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The final answer is: 736"

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101."
"To find the average loss, we need to calculate the total loss and then divide it by the number of races.

1. First, let's calculate the amount Johnny's dad lost in the first race: -$5.
2. In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, the amount he won in the second race is 2 * (-$5) + $1 = -$9.
3. In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, the amount he lost in the third race is 1.5 * (-$9) = -$13.5.
4. Now, let's calculate the total loss: -$5 + (-$9) + (-$13.5) = -$27.5.
5. Since there were 3 races, we divide the total loss by 3 to find the average loss: -$27.5 / 3 = -$9.17.

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to first calculate their current heights.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet, which is equal to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole's initial height was 50 inches and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's denote the share of the first person as x.

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

The share of the first person is $420."
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to convert 3/8ths to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

Combine like terms:

(2x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2(2x + 4) + x = 38

Expand the equation:

4x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

Initial price of the car = $20,000
Depreciation rate = 21% per year

Year 2008:
Price in 2008 = Initial price - (Initial price * depreciation rate)
= $20,000 - ($20,000 * 0.21)

"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since a twin bed has 1 set of sheets and a king size bed has 1 set of sheets, the total number of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 + 1 = 5.

Since he can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 1, which is 2. This means he can wash 2 twin sets of sheets and 1 king set of sheets at a time.

However, since he has 5 sets of sheets to wash, we need to calculate how many times he needs to wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set. We can do this by dividing 5 by 3 (2 twin sets + 1 king set), which is 1 with a remainder of 2. This means he needs to wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set once, and then wash the remaining 2 twin sets.

So, in a week, Greg does 2 loads of laundry.

To find out how many loads of laundry he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads he does in a week by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:

2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads/year

"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to add the number of classes that visited each day.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 207

The final answer is: 207"
"To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests.

John's scores are: 100, 100, 100, and 80.

First, let's add up the scores: 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Next, we divide the total score by the number of tests: 380 / 4 = 95

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"To find out how many pizzas are left, we first need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 is 0.7 x 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. 
They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 x 40 = 32 pizzas.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 = 3500 cents.

He also wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, which is 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 = 21000 cents.

The total cost of postage is the sum of the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons: 3500 + 21000 = 24300 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24300 / 100 = 243 dollars.

The final answer is: $243"
"To find out how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered, we need to subtract 3 from 10. 

10 - 3 = 7

So, Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 

7 * 4 = 28

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. Now, Sidney has 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches left. 

Sidney then ordered 3 more sub sandwiches. Now, he has 3 + 3 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches.

6 * 4 = 24

The total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 24."
"To find the number of trucks that had mechanical failures, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

So, 5 trucks had mechanical failures and could not deliver the fertiliser. 

The number of trucks that delivered the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. 

The total number of tons of fertiliser delivered is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total cost of the butter, we first need to determine how many pounds of butter Dennis needs to buy. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, he needs 6 pounds of butter.

Since the grocery store has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half off, we can calculate the cost as follows:

- For the first pound of butter, the cost is $4.00.
- For the second pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00 (since it's half off).

For the remaining 4 pounds of butter, the cost will be the same as the first pound, which is $4.00 per pound.

So, the total cost of the butter is:
$4.00 (first pound) + $2.00 (second pound) + $4.00 (third pound) + $4.00 (fourth pound) + $4.00 (fifth pound) + $4.00 (sixth pound) = $22.00

The final answer is: $22.00"
"To find the total number of guests, we need to add the number of classmates, dance class members, and family members, then subtract the number of people who said they could not come.

Total guests = 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family members) - 4 (could not come) = 41

Since the initial 20 guests are already included in the rental fee, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests.

Additional guests = 41 (total guests) - 20 (initial guests) = 21

Cost for additional guests = 21 (additional guests) * $6 (per guest) = $126

Total cost = $125 (rental fee) + $126 (cost for additional guests) = $251

The final answer is: $251"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has 3/4 of her money left. Since she had $60, she now has 3/4 * $60 = $45.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has 2/3 of her money left. Since she had $60, she now has 2/3 * $60 = $40.

To find the total amount of money they have left, we add the money Maggie and Riza have: $45 + $40 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat each day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats. However, we know that the total number of bananas is 315 and they last for a week, which is 7 days. 

So, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315. To find the total number of bananas eaten each day, we divide 315 by 7. 

315 / 7 = 45 bananas per day.

Now, we know that the first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day. So, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = 21 bananas each day.

The final answer is: 21"

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 
Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle. 
So, the total number of pieces he placed is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find out how much Jenny paid for the roses, we need to determine if she bought the roses by the dozen or individually. Since she bought 15 roses, it's more cost-effective for her to buy a dozen (12 roses) and 3 individual roses.

The cost of a dozen roses is $15. 
The cost of 3 individual roses is 3 * $2 = $6.
The total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she paid with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

Jenny leaves with 16 quarters."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the total amount from each item and then add them together.

6 milkshakes for $5.50 each will be 6 x $5.50 = $33
9 burger platters for $11 each will be 9 x $11 = $99
20 sodas for $1.50 each will be 20 x $1.50 = $30

Now, let's add the total amount from each item together: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162

"To find out how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time he needs to wait for the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station. Since the first train leaves at 30 minutes, the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.

3. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

4. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station. Since the second train leaves at 65 minutes, the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes.

5. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

6. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. Since the third train leaves at 125 minutes, the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long Paul needs to wait for the fourth train. Since the current time is not given, we assume it is 0 minutes. Paul will wait from 0 to 145 minutes for the fourth train. 

The final answer is: 145"
"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has saved in total, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week by the number of weeks she has saved them. 

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks in total and she already has 120, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs.

200 toothpicks (required) - 120 toothpicks (already saved) = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Melanie to save 80 toothpicks at the rate of 10 toothpicks per week.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is:

2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so the price his friend paid is:

1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price his friend paid, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100:

Discount = ((2000 - 1800) / 2000) * 100
Discount = (200 / 2000) * 100
Discount = 0.10 * 100
Discount = 10%

"To find the total number of jellyfish created, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of jellyfish each spring creates per second. 

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in 4 hours. 

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since there are 5 springs, each creating 1 jellyfish per second, the total number of jellyfish created per second is 5.

Now, we multiply the total number of seconds by the number of jellyfish created per second:

14400 seconds * 5 jellyfish/second = 72000 jellyfish

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first find twice Binkie's score. 

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180.

Frankie's score is 15 better than twice Binkie's score, so we add 15 to 180. 

Frankie's score is 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To find the total distance James walked, we need to calculate the distance to the store and back. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back, he walked a total of 2 * 4 = 8 miles.

Since James walks 4 miles per hour, we can find the time it took him to walk 8 miles by dividing the total distance by his speed: 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and compare it to the cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be: 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost would be: 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet. 

The total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

The amount of fence left over for Sam is: 20"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to first find out how many inches it grows per year. 

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find the growth rate per year, we divide the total growth by the number of years: 
8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year.

Now, we multiply the growth rate per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years:
2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

Let's break down the information:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the total earnings from all types of bikes:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck, and then subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

So, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field.

12"
"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we first need to find the total minutes he spends in class per day. 

There are 6 periods in a day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes per day is 6 * 40 = 240 minutes.

Since John goes to class for 5 days a week, the total minutes he spends in class per week is 240 * 5 = 1200 minutes.

Now, we need to find the total minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these two days. 

First, we need to find his total weekly minutes. Since there are 7 days in a week, and he spends 240 minutes per day in class, his total weekly minutes are 240 * 7 = 1680 minutes.

1/16 of 1680 minutes is (1/16) * 1680 = 105 minutes.

So, the total minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday is 105 minutes.

Now, we add the minutes he spends in class and the minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday to find his total weekly minutes. 

Total minutes = 1200 + 105 = 1305 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 

Total hours = 1305 / 60 = 21.75 hours.

(2/3) * 24 = 16 feet

The height of the ball after the second bounce is 2/3 of the height after the first bounce:
(2/3) * 16 = 10.67 feet

The final answer is: 10.67"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to convert the height of the first child to inches and then calculate the height of the other children.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by 10 to find the number of bags.

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

"To find the original weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the 270 kilograms left after the Allosaurus ate.

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which was half of what was left after the velociraptors ate. 

Let's call the weight left after the velociraptors ate 'x'. Since the Allosaurus ate half of 'x', we can set up the equation: x / 2 = 270.

To solve for 'x', we multiply both sides by 2: x = 270 * 2
x = 540

So, 540 kilograms were left after the velociraptors ate. 

The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Let's call the weight left after the T-Rex ate 'y'. Since the velociraptors ate half of 'y', we can set up the equation: y / 2 = 540.

To solve for 'y', we multiply both sides by 2: y = 540 * 2
y = 1080

So, 1080 kilograms were left after the T-Rex ate. 

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the original weight of the triceratops was twice the weight left after the T-Rex ate: 1080 * 2 = 2160.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint to find out how many gallons are needed. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet. 
The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet. 
The total area of all the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost of painting the room is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so 3 were shaken and 9 were unshaken. Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 1 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 7 sodas in total, with 1 shaken and 6 unshaken. The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans.

Probability = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of cans)
Probability = 1 / 7

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:

Probability = (1 / 7) * 100
Probability = 14.29%

"To find the total number of days Billy helps, we first need to find the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

Now, we subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy helps. 
50 - 10 = 40

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so we need to find the total number of hours he helps per day. 
2 people/hour * 3 hours = 6 people/day

Now, we multiply the number of days Billy helps by the number of people he can help per day. 
40 days * 6 people/day = 240 people

"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people who were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people who were present.

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses:
12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars:
20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the number of people transported from the total number of people present. However, the total number of people present is not given. 

But, we can assume that the total number of people present is the sum of the people transported by the buses and the cars and the people inside the church. 

Let's denote the number of people inside the church as x. Then, the total number of people present is x + 480.

However, the total number of people present is also equal to the sum of the number of private cars and the number of buses, which is 20 + 12 = 32.

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of each slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time = 3 minutes

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the two slides:
Difference in time = Time for the biggest slide - Time for the second biggest slide
Difference in time = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference in time = 2 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 
The total time spent on breaks is 2 * 15 = 30 minutes.
The total time spent per day is 30 (lunch) + 30 (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. 
After 5 days, the total time spent is 1 * 5 = 5 hours.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total miles run by all three is 52. We already know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after returning the item and then add it to the initial charge minus the returned item.

Initial charge: $85.00
Returned item: -$15.00
New balance after return: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Frying pan: 20% off $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Cost of frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Towels: 10% off $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Cost of towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Total cost of new purchases: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

New balance on credit card: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

"Let's break down the information given:

1. A fifth of the jellyfish are large.
2. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
3. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue.
4. When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.

From point 2, we know that 1/3 of the large jellyfish change color. This means 2/3 of the large jellyfish do not change color. Since they are all green, we can ignore them for now.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. The number of large jellyfish is x/5. The number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)*(x/5) = x/15.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color. This is equal to the number of large jellyfish that change color, which is x/15. So, we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for her retirement. 

First, let's calculate her annual expenses in retirement: 
40% of $100,000 = 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

Since she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, the total amount she needs to save is:
$40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

Now, let's calculate how much she saves per year. 
20% of $100,000 = 0.2 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

To find out how many years she needs to work to save $800,000, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by the amount she saves per year:
$800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for her retirement. Since she already plans to live for 20 years in retirement, we need to subtract this from the total number of years:
40 - 20 = 20 years.

"To find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. If she hikes 125 miles twice a day, that's a total of 250 miles per day. 

To find out how many days it will take her to hike 9,300 miles at this rate, we divide 9,300 by 250. 

9,300 / 250 = 37.2 days

Since Soledad only has 30 days, she will not be able to complete her journey on time. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day, we need to find out how many miles she needs to hike in 30 days to reach 9,300 miles.

9,300 / 30 = 310 miles per day

Since she is currently hiking 250 miles per day, we subtract 250 from 310 to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day.

310 - 250 = 60

So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"To find the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers, we first need to find the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour and the 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour produce a total of 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour produce a total of 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour.

So, the total number of toys produced by these 4 workers per hour is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since they work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by these 4 workers is 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

The total number of toys needed is 400, and 200 toys were produced, so the manufacturer still needs 400 - 200 = 200 toys to be able to ship the order.

However, the problem states that the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys, not 200. This means that the 5th worker must have produced some toys to make up the difference between 200 and 20.

The difference between 200 and 20 is 180 toys. Since the 5th worker worked for 10 hours, the number of toys produced by the 5th worker per hour is 180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour.

"To find the total number of M&M's, we need to multiply the number of large bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply by the number of M&M's per ounce. 

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Now, we need to divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag to find the number of small bags.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to first calculate half of the circumference of the earth. 

Half of the circumference of the earth is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Since Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, we can find the number of days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers by dividing 20,000 by 400.

20,000 / 400 = 50

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's call this number A.
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted S. Then, Camden painted S + 12 eggs.
3. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56, so we can write the equation: A + A + (S + 12) + S = 56
4. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2A + 2S + 12 = 56
5. Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get: 2A + 2S = 44
6. Dividing both sides by 2, we get: A + S = 22
7. Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we can write the equation: S + (S + 12) = 30
8. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2S + 12 = 30
9. Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get: 2S = 18
10. Dividing both sides by 2, we get: S = 9
11. Now that we know S, we can find A: A + S = 22, so A + 9 = 22, A = 13
12. Camden painted S + 12 eggs, so Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.
13. The difference between the number of eggs Camden and Arnold painted is 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total number of boxes and the total weight of the crayons and boxes.

Nik has 200 crayons and wants to put them into boxes of 8 crayons each. To find the total number of boxes, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box:

200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces and there are 16 ounces in a pound, the weight of each box in pounds is:

8 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 0.5 pounds per box

The total weight of the boxes is the number of boxes multiplied by the weight of each box:

25 boxes * 0.5 pounds per box = 12.5 pounds

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and there are 200 crayons. The total weight of the crayons is:

200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces

To convert the weight of the crayons to pounds, we divide by 16:

200 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is the sum of their weights:

12.5 pounds (boxes) + 12.5 pounds (crayons) = 25 pounds

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to calculate 80% of 80 feet. 

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet, we divide 64 by 4 to find the number of logs.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks. So, the total number of planks is:

16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2. To find the total amount he makes, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Valerie earns $5000 per month.
2. Valerie's brother earns 2 times what Valerie earns, so he earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.
3. Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.
4. Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.
5. To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk.
2. On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. Let's call her speed on the beach ""x"" miles per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.
3. The time spent on the beach is 40 minutes. Since distance = speed * time, we can set up the equation: 2 = x * 40. Solving for x, we get x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.
4. Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk: 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.
5. The time spent on the sidewalk is 1 mile / (1/10 miles per minute) = 10 minutes.
6. The total time spent walking is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk: 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is:
$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60:
$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles and has 60 marbles, we need to find out how many marbles he had initially. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24.

So, if Bob receives 24 more marbles and has 60 marbles, we can set up an equation to find the initial number of marbles he had:

Initial marbles + 24 = 60

To find the initial number of marbles, we need to subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

Initial marbles = 60 - 24
Initial marbles = 36

Now, we know that Bob initially had 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, we can find the number of marbles he will have left by subtracting 10 from 36:

36 - 10 = 26

So, Bob will have 26 marbles.

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle. 

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the temperatures of the two mugs. 

The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle). 

The average temperature of the water in the bottle is (33 + x) / 2.

Since Donny can drink the water, the average temperature must be at least 40 degrees. 

We can set up the inequality:

(33 + x) / 2 ≥ 40

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:

33 + x ≥ 80

Subtract 33 from both sides:

x ≥ 47

So, the second bottle must be at least 47 degrees.

The final answer is: 47"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows

Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
= 470 cows + 230 chickens
= 700 animals

"To find the total cost of the bagels, we need to first calculate the original price of 4 packs of bagels. 

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs will cost 4 x $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $40.00 and subtract it from the original price.

10% of $40.00 is 0.1 x $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, and Russell ordered 4 packs, the total number of bagels is 9 x 4 = 36.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate, we first need to find out how many scoops 1 potato makes. 

It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
1 less than 3 scoops is 3 - 1 = 2 scoops. 
So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
Now, we know that 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, so 1 potato makes 2/3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
So, Gomer ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate. 
Since 1 potato makes 2/3 scoops of mashed potatoes, we can find out how many potatoes Gomer ate by dividing the total scoops by 2/3. 
18 / (2/3) = 18 * (3/2) = 27

"To find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. 
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total number of eggs in 60 days = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.
240 eggs / 12 = 20

"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to find the total number of red jellybeans. We know there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans. 

Number of red jellybeans = 2 * Number of green jellybeans
Number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17
Number of red jellybeans = 34

Now, we know the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can find the total number of green and red jellybeans by adding the number of green and red jellybeans.

Total green and red jellybeans = Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans
Total green and red jellybeans = 17 + 34
Total green and red jellybeans = 51

Now, we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - Total green and red jellybeans
Number of blue jellybeans = 60 - 51
Number of blue jellybeans = 9

"Let's break down the information given:

- The cost of a sunflower is $2.
- The cost of a bouquet is $8, which contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earns $26 from sunflowers per day.
- Faraday earns $56 from bouquets per day.

First, let's find out how many sunflowers Faraday sells per day from the bouquets. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers and he earns $56 from bouquets per day, we can find the number of bouquets sold per day by dividing the daily earnings from bouquets by the cost of a bouquet:

$56 (daily earnings from bouquets) / $8 (cost of a bouquet) = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets is:

7 bouquets/day * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers/day

Now, let's find out how many sunflowers Faraday sells per day from individual sunflowers. We know he earns $26 from sunflowers per day, and each sunflower costs $2. So, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:

$26 (daily earnings from sunflowers) / $2 (cost of a sunflower) = 13 sunflowers/day

Now, let's find the total number of sunflowers sold per day:

84 sunflowers/day (from bouquets) + 13 sunflowers/day (from individual sunflowers) = 97 sunflowers/day

To find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days, we multiply the daily sales by 3:

97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers

First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with $100. 
Cost per rock = $5
Total money = $100
Number of rocks = Total money / Cost per rock
Number of rocks = 100 / 5
Number of rocks = 20

Now, let's find out how much money Adam gets from selling 60% of his inventory.
Number of rocks sold = 60% of 20
Number of rocks sold = 0.6 * 20
Number of rocks sold = 12
Revenue per rock = $7
Total revenue = Number of rocks sold * Revenue per rock
Total revenue = 12 * 7

"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of large, medium, and small-sized picture scenes Lauren needs to draw. 

First, let's find the LCM of 45, 36, and 49. 

The prime factorization of 45 is 3^2 * 5.
The prime factorization of 36 is 2^2 * 3^2.
The prime factorization of 49 is 7^2.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
LCM(45, 36, 49) = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5 * 7^2 = 4 * 9 * 5 * 49 = 8820.

Now, let's find out how many days it will take Lauren to draw each type of picture scene:
- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 / 5 = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 / 6 = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 / 7 = 7 days

The LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of all three numbers, so it will take Lauren at least 8820 / 5 = 1764 days to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes, 8820 / 6 = 1470 days to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes, and 8820 / 7 = 1260 days to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes. However, since the LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of all three numbers, the actual number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project is the LCM of the number of days it takes her to draw each type of picture scene.

The LCM of 9, 6, and 7 is 126. 

Therefore, it will take Lauren 126 days to complete the project.

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters.

The remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $60 from the third sale. 

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. 

Haley's age is 26 years. Half of 26 is 26 / 2 = 13.

Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, so we need to subtract 10 from 13. 

13 - 10 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to first find out how many face masks he uses in a day. 

Since Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, the total number of face masks he uses in a day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2. 

6 * 2 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found by each person and subtract that from the initial number of eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Total eggs found = 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Initial number of eggs = 3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Eggs still hidden = 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to find the size of the third apartment complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so their combined size is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400.

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. Adding this to 400 gives 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

So, the total number of apartments is 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects from 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the fruits produced each year and add them up.

- Year 1 (5 years old): 50 fruits
- Year 2 (6 years old): 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
- Year 3 (7 years old): 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- Year 4 (8 years old): 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, but we don't know the production of a 10-year-old tree yet. Let's call the production of a 10-year-old tree 'x'. So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is x - 200.
- Year 5 (9 years old): 0 fruits (no production)
- Year 6 (10 years old): 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, we need to find the production of a 10-year-old tree to calculate the production of an 8-year-old tree. We know that a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. 

Now we can find the production of an 8-year-old tree: x - 200 = 1000. Solving for x, we get x = 1200.

Now we can find the production of an 8-year-old tree: x - 200 = 1200 - 200 = 1000 fruits.

Now we can add up the fruits produced each year: 
50 + 150 + 350 + 1000 + 0 + 1000 = 1550

The final answer is: 1550"
"To find out how much money Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of Sophia's $100 and add it to Jack's initial $100.

1/5 of $100 is $100 / 5 = $20.

Now, we add this amount to Jack's initial $100: $100 + $20 = $120.

So, Jack now has $120.

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R. 

We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so B = Y - 7.

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so R = 4B.

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so Y + B + R = 37.

Substituting the expressions for B and R into the equation, we get Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37.

Combine like terms: Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37.

Combine like terms again: 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides: 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6: Y = 12.

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope: B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5.

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope: R = 4B = 4 * 5 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Ronnie was given x dollars. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3x dollars.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Ronnie is left with x - y dollars and Rissa is left with 3x - y dollars, where y is the amount they each gave to their little sister.

We are told that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money, so we can set up the equation:

3x - y = (4/5)(3x)

To solve for y, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

15x - 5y = 12x

Now, we can subtract 12x from both sides to get:

3x - 5y = 0

Now, we can add 5y to both sides to get:

3x = 5y

Now, we can divide both sides by 5 to get:

(3/5)x = y

Now, we can substitute this expression for y into the equation for Ronnie's remaining money:

x - y = x - (3/5)x

To simplify, we can factor out x:

x - (3/5)x = (2/5)x

So, Ronnie is left with (2/5)x dollars.

We are also given that Ronnie was given $5, so we can set up the equation:

x = 5

Now, we can substitute this value into the expression for Ronnie's remaining money:

(2/5)x = (2/5)(5)
= 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the information given:

- There are 4 colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow.
- There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
- Half the mural is yellow.
- The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is the combination of red, white, and purple paint. Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as x. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the total amount of these three colors is 3x.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow. So, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

The other half of the mural is the combination of red, white, and purple paint, which is 3x. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, we can set up the equation:

3x + 6 = 12

Subtract 6 from both sides:

3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x = 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. 
Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas together: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

The final answer is: 3160"

On Wednesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she counts double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds for each day:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box for $1, we first need to find out how many pods are in the new box. 

The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. 20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. So the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with the new box for $12. Since the new box costs $12 and you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 120 cycles with the new box for $12.

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the total number of cycles by 12. 

120 cycles / 12 = 10 cycles per dollar.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since he withdraws 1000 dollars in 20 dollar bills, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which means he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he has 20 bills left, and each bill is worth $20, he has 20 * 20 = $400. Tripling this amount gives him 3 * 400 = $1200.

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has $1200, he needs 1200 / 5 = 240 5 dollar bills.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by both teams in the first and second half.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how many days he can use the chalk after Monday.

Initially, the teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk, so the remaining chalk is 55% of the original 5 inches.

55% of 5 inches = 0.55 * 5 = 2.75 inches

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days he can use the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. Then, the amount of chalk used each day is 20% of 2.75 inches.

20% of 2.75 inches = 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day

The total amount of chalk used in 'x' days is 0.55x inches. Since the teacher starts with 2.75 inches, we can set up the equation:

0.55x = 2.75

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.55:

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

The teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle the chalk."

"Let's denote Colin's current age as C and Wendy's current age as W.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

For pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 4 * 6 = 24.

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, Kate will need 36 / 12 = 3 cheese pizzas. 

Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, Kate will need 24 / 8 = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many snowballs Jay builds and how many melt in a given time period. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is 60 minutes. So, in 15 minutes, he builds 20/60 * 15 = 5 snowballs. 

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. So, in 15 minutes, Jay has 5 - 2 = 3 snowballs left.

Now, let's calculate how many snowballs Jay has after 1 hour (60 minutes). In 60 minutes, Jay builds 20 snowballs and 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs melt (since 2 melt every 15 minutes, and there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour). So, Jay has 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs after 1 hour.

Since Jay starts with 0 snowballs, he needs 60 - 12 = 48 more snowballs to reach 60. 

Now, let's calculate how many 15-minute intervals it will take to build 48 snowballs. In each 15-minute interval, Jay builds 5 snowballs. So, to build 48 snowballs, it will take 48 / 5 = 9.6 intervals. 

Since Jay can't build a fraction of an interval, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can calculate the total time it will take by multiplying the number of intervals by 15 minutes. 

9.6 intervals * 15 minutes = 144 minutes.

However, we need to add the initial 60 minutes it took Jay to build 12 snowballs. 

144 minutes + 60 minutes = 204 minutes.

"Let's break down the information given:

- On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
- On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages (since 50 / 2 = 25).
- They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x. 

After the first day, they had x - 38 + 50 bandages (since they ordered 1 pack of 50).
After the second day, they had (x - 38 + 50) - 28 bandages.
After the third day, they had ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) - 25 + 100 bandages (since they ordered 2 packs of 50).

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation:
x - 38 + 50 - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78
x + 57 = 78

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is 20 + 40 = 60.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which is 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, which is 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 + 50 = 80.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 + 80 = 140.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how much root beer was available for each person to drink, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer left after all the incidents. 

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer. 

On the first day, 4 gallons were stolen by his children. So, 24 - 4 = 20 gallons were left.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled. So, 20 - 7 = 13 gallons were left.

On the third day, 5 gallons were taken by Ronnie. So, 13 - 5 = 8 gallons were left.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the remaining root beer equally. To find out how much each person got, we need to divide the remaining root beer by the number of people. 

8 gallons / 3 people = 2.67 gallons per person.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let x be the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The problem states that ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8.

We are told that this expression is equal to 40, so we can set up the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we need to calculate one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

Now, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes. First, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. 

The number of fish without red stripes is 66 - 22 = 44.

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish. 

5/11 of 44 is (5/11) * 44 = 20.

Now, we need to add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes. 

The total number of fish with red and blue stripes is 22 + 20 = 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"Amy initially had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes. 

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one palette, so Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors. Now, Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors left.

Amy then used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 eyeshadow colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the information given.

1. Mattison's height: 60 inches
2. The two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison: 7 * 60 = 420 inches
3. The first floor's floor to ceiling height is thrice as high as Mattison: 3 * 60 = 180 inches

Since the total height of the two-story house is 420 inches, and the first floor's height is 180 inches, we can find the height of the second floor by subtracting the first floor's height from the total height of the house:
420 - 180 = 240 inches

Now, to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house:
420 - 240 = 180 inches

However, this is the height of the first floor, not the second floor. The second floor's height is 240 inches. The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the height of the first floor, which is 180 inches.

The final answer is: 180"
"To find the number of shells found by team Alphas, we need to calculate 40% of 700. 

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found their share. 

Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
= 700 - 280
= 420 shells.

Next, we need to find the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters. 

Shells found by Gogetters = Total shells - (Shells found by Alphas + Shells found by The finders)
= 700 - (280 + 252)
= 700 - 532
= 168 shells.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we need to first calculate the total miles walked by the first three dogs and then subtract that from the total average miles walked by all four dogs.

The first dog needs to walk 1 mile, the second needs 4 miles, and the third needs 3 miles. So, the total miles walked by the first three dogs is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

The average miles walked by all four dogs is 3 miles. Since there are 4 dogs, the total miles walked by all four dogs is 3 * 4 = 12 miles.

Now, to find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs: 12 - 8 = 4 miles.

The last dog needs to walk 4 miles."
"To find out how much John borrowed, we need to calculate 40% of the value of his house. 

40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

He used 60% of this amount to pay off his debts. 

60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

Now, to find out how much money he had leftover, we subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts from the amount he borrowed.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To find the total weight of the tunas, we need to add the weights of all three tunas. 

Weight of the first tuna = 56 kilograms
Weight of the second tuna = 46 kilograms
Weight of the last tuna = 26 kilograms

Total weight of the tunas = 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we need to multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Total weight of the tunas * Cost per kilogram
Total earnings = 128 * 0.50
Total earnings = 64

The final answer is: $64"
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The cost price of the magazines is $72. 
The selling price is 11/8 of the cost price. 

To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 11/8:
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = (11 * 72) / 8
Selling price = 792 / 8
Selling price = 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

The final answer is: $27"
"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed by each setting and add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. 
The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters of water per day.
The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters of water per day.

Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, so the total water removed by the low setting is 3 * 1 = 3 liters.
He ran it for 3 days on the medium setting, so the total water removed by the medium setting is 3 * 2 = 6 liters.
He ran it for 5 days on the high setting, so the total water removed by the high setting is 5 * 4 = 20 liters.

The total amount of water removed is 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

"To find out how many balloons were thrown, we need to first find the total number of balloons Jolene and her friends had. 

They filled up 10 packs of balloons with 30 balloons per pack. So, the total number of balloons is 10 * 30 = 300.

Since 12 balloons were left, we subtract those from the total to find out how many were thrown. 

300 - 12 = 288

"To find the total amount of the second medicine, we need to calculate 3 times the amount of the first medicine. 

The first medicine is 14 mL, so 3 times that amount is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

Now, we need to find the total amount of both medicines in one dose. 
The first medicine is 14 mL and the second medicine is 42 mL, so the total amount in one dose is 14 + 42 = 56 mL.

To find the total amount in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8. 
56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

The final answer is: 448"
"To find the capacity of John's classes, we need to find 1/8 of Ali's class capacity. 

Ali's class capacity is 120 students. 
1/8 of 120 is 120 / 8 = 15 students per class.

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is 15 * 2 = 30 students.

The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of Ali's class capacity and John's classes capacity. 
Combined capacity = 120 (Ali's class) + 30 (John's classes) = 150 students.

"To find the total amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the total interest he owes his sister. 

The interest is 2% of $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he will pay in the first 11 months is 11 * 25 = $275.

The remaining amount, including the interest, that Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is the initial amount borrowed plus the interest minus the amount he paid in the first 11 months. 

So, the amount he will pay in the twelfth month is 300 + 6 - 275 = 31.

"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to first find out the total number of diapers changed per day. 

Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes per day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day.

Since Jordan's wife changes 5 diapers per day, Jordan changes the remaining half, which is also 5 diapers per day.

"To find the total volume of the jar, we need to multiply the length, width, and height of the jar. 

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume used by the jelly beans will be 80% of the total volume.

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Since a jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of a single jelly bean.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of a single jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between his guess and the true number of red jelly beans.

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Number of red jelly beans estimated by Tim
However, we do not know Tim's guess.  To find Tim's guess, we need to find the number of jelly beans he would have estimated based on the volume of the jar and the efficiency of packing. 

The volume of the jar is 540 cubic inches.  Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume used by the jelly beans will be 80% of the total volume.

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Since a jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of a single jelly bean.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of a single jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

However, this is the number of red jelly beans if the jar is completely filled with jelly beans.  Since the jar is not completely filled, we need to find the ratio of the actual number of jelly beans to the number of jelly beans that would fill the jar.

Ratio = Actual number of jelly beans / Number of jelly beans that would fill the jar
Ratio = 900 / 864
Ratio = 1.0417

Since the jar is not completely filled, the number of jelly beans that would fill the jar is more than the actual number of jelly beans.  To find the number of jelly beans that would fill the jar, we can divide the actual number of jelly beans by the ratio.

Number of jelly beans that would fill the jar = Actual number of jelly beans / Ratio
Number of jelly beans that would fill the jar = 900 / 1.0417
Number of jelly beans that would fill the jar = 864.7

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans that would fill the jar by multiplying the number of jelly beans that would fill the jar by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans that would fill the jar = Number of jelly beans that would fill the jar * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans that would fill the jar = 864.7 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans that would fill the jar = 259.41

However, this is the number of red jelly beans if the jar is completely filled.  Since the jar is not completely filled, we need to find the ratio of the actual number of red jelly beans to the number of red jelly beans that would fill the jar.

Ratio = Actual number of red jelly beans / Number of red jelly beans that would fill the jar
Ratio = 900 / 259.41
Ratio = 3.47

Since the jar is not completely filled, the number of red jelly beans that would fill the jar is more than the actual number of red jelly beans.  To find the number of red jelly beans that would fill the jar, we can divide the actual number of red jelly beans by the ratio.

Number of red jelly beans that would fill the jar = Actual number of red jelly beans / Ratio
Number of red jelly beans that would fill the jar = 900 / 3.47
Number of red jelly beans that would fill the jar = 259.41

Now we can find the number of jelly beans that would fill the jar.

Number of jelly beans that would fill the jar = Actual number of red jelly beans / 0.3
Number of jelly beans that would fill the jar = 259.41 / 0.3
Number of jelly beans that would fill the jar = 864.7

Now we can find the volume of the jar that is actually filled with jelly beans.

Volume of the jar that is actually filled with jelly beans = Number of jelly beans that would fill the jar * Volume of a single jelly bean
Volume of the jar that is actually filled with jelly beans = 864.7 * 0.15
Volume of the jar that is actually filled with jelly beans = 129.51

Now we can find the actual volume of the jar.

Actual volume of the jar = Volume of the jar that is actually filled with jelly beans / 0.8
Actual volume of the jar = 129.51 / 0.8
Actual volume of the jar = 161.9

Now we can find the actual volume of the jar in terms of the volume of the original jar.

Actual volume of the jar = Actual volume of the jar / Volume of the original jar
Actual volume of the jar = 161.9 / 540
Actual volume of the jar = 0.3

Now we can find the number of jelly beans that would fill the jar.

Number of jelly beans that would fill the jar = Actual volume of the jar / Volume of a single jelly bean

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the bus had 20 people.
2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.
3. At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop (40) entered the bus. 
   3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30.
   So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.
4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. 
   The current number of people on the bus is 90. 
   Doubling this number gives 90 * 2 = 180.

Now, the bus has 180 people. The capacity of the bus is 200. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity:
200 - 180 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for the first 5 years and the cost of visits for the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5. The annual cost is 3 * $5 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

The total cost for all visits is $30 + $45 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to find out how many groups of 8 students can be formed from 10 students in each grade. 

Since there are 4 grades (4-7), there are a total of 4 x 10 = 40 students. 

Now, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of students per group, which is 8. 

40 students / 8 students per group = 5 groups.

Since each group takes 45 minutes, we multiply the number of groups by the time per group to find the total time.

5 groups * 45 minutes per group = 225 minutes.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the tables and the total cost of the roof frames, then add them together.

The cost of the tables is 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.
The cost of the roof frames is 2 frames * $10 per frame = $20.

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames together: $80 + $20 = $100.

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet, we can find the length of the longer piece:

Length of the longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32 feet

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we can find out how much seasoning he needs. He adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat.

Total pounds of meat needed = 5
Seasoning per pound = 2 tablespoons

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

1. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. 
   Let's say the number of cupcakes is x. Then, the number of brownies is 3x - 2.

2. Each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. 
   So, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

3. The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies. 
   So, we can write the equation: x + (3x - 2) = 10

4. Now, let's solve the equation: 
   x + 3x - 2 = 10
   4x - 2 = 10

The discount on the manicure is 20% of $35, which is 0.2 * 35 = $7. 
The discount on the pedicure is 20% of $40, which is 0.2 * 40 = $8.

The total discount is $7 + $8 = $15.

The cost of the manicure after the discount is $35 - $7 = $28.
The cost of the pedicure after the discount is $40 - $8 = $32.

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure is $28 + $32 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers, the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost Karen would pay is $60 + $30 = $90.

"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to follow the given steps:

1. The price of the toy in November is $40.
2. In December, the price increased by 80%. 
   To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.8 (100% + 80% = 180%, or 1 + 1.8 = 2.8, or 100% + 80% = 180%, or 1 + 80/100 = 1.8).
   So, the price in December is $40 * 1.8 = $72.
3. In January, the price decreased by 50%. 
   To find the new price, we multiply the price in December by 0.5 (100% - 50% = 50%, or 1 - 0.5 = 0.5, or 100% - 50% = 50%, or 1 - 50/100 = 0.5).
   So, the price in January is $72 * 0.5 = $36.

"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the standard lessons and the veteran lessons separately, and then add them together.

For the standard lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. So, the total amount he earns from standard lessons is:
4 * $80 = $320

For the veteran lessons, Charlie reduces his rate by 25%. This means he charges 75% of his standard rate, which is 0.75 * $80 = $60 per hour. He has 2 lessons at this rate. So, the total amount he earns from veteran lessons is:
2 * $60 = $120

Original amount of pomelos = 20
Amount of pomelos left = 1/4 * 20 = 5

Now, we know Eve had 20 pomelos originally and was left with 5. To find out how many she gave away, we subtract the amount left from the original amount:

Pomelos given away = Original amount - Amount left

"To find the number of apples Walter ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60. 

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining.

60 - 24 = 36

Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. To find 25% of 36, we need to multiply 36 by 0.25.

0.25 * 36 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining.

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total amount of money he received, we need to multiply the number of remaining apples by the price per apple.

"To find the total distance Michael covers in 3 days, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours in 3 days. 

There are 24 hours in a day, so 3 days have 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we multiply his average speed by the total hours: 
50 km/hr * 72 hr = 3600 km

Now, we need to find the percentage of the distance he covered. To do this, we divide the distance he covered by the total distance between Alaska and Texas, and then multiply by 100.

Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, so he used 6 x 5 = 30 grapes.
3. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.
4. The remaining grapes are used by their mother to make pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the number of pies she can make is 36 / 12 = 3 pies.
5. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used by their mother is 3 x 12 = 36 grapes.
6. The total number of grapes used by all three is 36 (by Madeline) + 30 (by her brother) + 36 (by their mother) = 102 grapes.
7. Since the total number of grapes used is 102, the initial number of grapes is 102 + x (the number of grapes left over). However, since the problem states that the remaining grapes were used to make pies, we can assume that there are no leftover grapes. Therefore, the initial number of grapes is equal to the total number of grapes used.

However, this is not the case here. The problem states that the remaining grapes were used to make pies. So, we need to find the initial number of grapes. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Let the initial number of grapes be x. Madeline ate 6 grapes, so the remaining grapes are x - 6. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes. The remaining grapes are (x - 6) - 30 = x - 36. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, so the number of grapes used by her is 4 * 12 = 48. The remaining grapes are x - 36 - 48 = x - 84.

Since the problem states that the remaining grapes were used to make pies, we can assume that there are no leftover grapes. Therefore, the number of grapes used by their mother is equal to the remaining grapes, which is x - 84. We know that the number of grapes used by their mother is 48, so we can set up the equation x - 84 = 48.

Solving for x, we get x = 132.

"To find the total number of classrooms the custodian needs to clean, we already know that number is 80. 

The total time they have to clean is 5 days. Since they work 8 hours a day, the total time they have to clean is 5 days * 8 hours/day = 40 hours.

The total time it takes to clean all the classrooms is 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes. 

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours.

Now, we can find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms by dividing the time spent cleaning by the total time available and multiplying by 100: (20 hours / 40 hours) * 100 = 50%.

"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to determine the capacity of each shelf. 

The middle shelves can hold 10 books each. 
The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.
The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase. 
Two middle shelves can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.
The bottom shelf can hold 20 books.
The top shelf can hold 15 books.
So, the total capacity of one bookcase is 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase to find out how many bookcases she needs.
110 / 55 = 2

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books."

"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to first find the cost of the additional phones. 

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation 2x = 20.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 20 / 2 = 10.

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is 4x = 4 * 10 = 40.

"To find out how many days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads per day.

First, let's find out how many photos she uploads per day. Since she uploads 6 batches of 7 photos each day, we multiply 6 batches by 7 photos per batch:

6 batches/day * 7 photos/batch = 42 photos/day

Now, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads per day:

210 photos / 42 photos/day = 5 days

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all her photos.

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining four days.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.
On the second day, Conor saw 20 more people than on the first day, so he saw 50 + 20 = 70 people.
On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so he saw 2 * 70 = 140 people.

The total number of people Conor saw on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining four days, the total number of people he saw on those days is 60 * 4 = 240.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500.

"To find the total number of popcorn pieces, we need to calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval and add them up.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial popping rate popped, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels popped.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, so 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped:

20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210

The total number of popcorn pieces Garrett has to eat is 210."
"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade he needs to make, which is 4 gallons for the party plus 1 extra gallon for Allen. 

Total gallons = 4 + 1 = 5 gallons

Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, and 5 gallons will require 5 cups of lemon juice, we need to find out how many lemons are needed to get 5 cups of juice.

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can find the number of lemons needed for 5 cups by multiplying 6 lemons by 5 cups.

Number of lemons needed = 6 lemons/cup * 5 cups = 30 lemons

"To find the distance Elvis traveled west, we multiply the speed by the time: 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles.

To find the distance Elvis traveled east, we multiply the speed by the time: 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the difference between the two distances to determine how far he is from his house now. 

The distance traveled west is 90 miles, and the distance traveled east is 144 miles. To find the net distance from his house, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east: 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles.

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

Initial value of the boat = $9000

Depreciation in the first year = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Depreciation in the second year = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Depreciation in the third year = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after the third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many holes the dog digs in total and then subtract the holes filled by Nate from the total holes.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total holes dug by the dog is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Since the dog digs 6 new holes every night, we need to add these to the total holes. However, we don't know how many days Nate takes to fill the holes, so we can't directly calculate the number of nights. 

Let's assume it takes x weeks for Nate to fill the holes. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days is 7x.

In x weeks, the dog digs 6 * 7x = 42x new holes.

The total number of holes is the sum of the holes dug by the dog and the new holes dug by the dog while Nate is filling the holes. This is 84 + 42x.

Nate fills 9 holes a day, so in 7x days, he fills 9 * 7x = 63x holes.

Since Nate fills all the holes, the total holes filled by Nate is equal to the total holes. So, we can set up the equation:

84 + 42x = 63x

Subtracting 42x from both sides gives us:

42 = 21x

Dividing both sides by 21 gives us:

x = 2

Since x is the number of weeks, the answer is 2 weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the average enrollment at Butler High School, we need to multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4.

Average enrollment at Norman High School = 4000 students
Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * 4000
= 3000 students

Now, we need to find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School.

Difference in enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Number of chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The final answer is: 2325"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested (16), so he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
- He gathered two more Petri dishes than requested (14), so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
- He gathered the correct number of beakers (7).
- The total number of items on the lab bench is 29.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

8 (test tubes) + 7 (beakers) + 16 (Petri dishes) + x (lost beakers) = 29

Combine the known quantities:
8 + 7 + 16 = 31

Now, subtract 31 from both sides of the equation to isolate x:
31 + x = 29
x = 29 - 31
x = -2

However, since we can't have a negative number of lost beakers, this means that Igor didn't lose any beakers. The correct interpretation is that the equation is not balanced, and the correct number of beakers should be 29 - 8 - 16 = 5. 

So, Igor had 7 - 5 = 2 beakers left, and the question asks for the number of beakers he lost."
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to find the number of eggs in the second basket and add it to the number of eggs in the first basket.

Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as in the first basket, and the first basket has 10 eggs, the second basket has 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 (first basket) + 20 (second basket) = 30 eggs.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to find the amount raised by each girl and add them together.

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430. So, Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. So, Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we add the amounts raised by each girl: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa.
2. Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron.
3. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
4. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if Aaron runs 1 mile in x minutes, Vanessa will run 1 mile in 2x minutes. 

Given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes and he ran half the distance Vanessa did (since Vanessa ran twice as far), we can set up the equation:

x * 2 = 16 (since Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa did, but at twice the speed)

Solving for x, we get:
x = 16 / 2
x = 8

Now that we know Aaron runs 1 mile in 8 minutes, we can find out how long it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile:
Vanessa runs 1 mile in 2x = 2 * 8 = 16 minutes

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, we multiply the time it takes her to run 1 mile by 4:
16 * 4 = 64 minutes

The final answer is: 64"
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line

Since he already has 6 feet of new line, we need to subtract that from the total amount of line required.

600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate their daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

Daily earnings = (2 meals * $5) + $5 (bottle of wine) = (2 * $5) + $5 = $10 + $5 = $15
Daily earnings = $15

Since they are open 2 days a week, their weekly earnings = daily earnings * 2 = $15 * 2 = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"To find the cost of each watermelon, we first need to find the total selling price of all the watermelons. 

The profit percentage is 25%, which means the selling price is 125% of the cost price (100% + 25% profit). 

The cost price of 50 watermelons is $80. 

Let's calculate the total selling price: 
Total selling price = Cost price + Profit
Total selling price = $80 + (25% of $80)
Total selling price = $80 + (0.25 * $80)
Total selling price = $80 + $20
Total selling price = $100

Now, we know the total selling price of 50 watermelons is $100. To find the selling price of one watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
Selling price of one watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
Selling price of one watermelon = $100 / 50
Selling price of one watermelon = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. James is now twice as old as Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that James is 2 * 12 = 24 years old now.
2. Since James is 24 years old now, and he was born when John was 19, John is now 24 + 19 = 43 years old.
3. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, which means the youngest son is 43 - 32 = 11 years old now.
4. In 3 years, the youngest son will be 11 + 3 = 14 years old.

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

To find out how many more oranges Ana has peeled than Jane, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peeled from the number of oranges Ana peeled: 20 - 15 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total cost, first, calculate the discount on the radiator. The original price is $400, and Mark gets it for 80% off. 

80% off of $400 is 0.8 * $400 = $320.

So, Mark pays $400 - $320 = $80 for the radiator.

Next, calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour.

The total cost for the mechanic is 3 * $50 = $150.

Now, add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic to find the total cost.

The total cost is $80 + $150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write the equation:

2C + 4W = 70

We can solve the first equation for W:

W = 20 - C

Now, substitute this expression for W into the second equation:

2C + 4(20 - C) = 70

Expand the equation:

2C + 80 - 4C = 70

Combine like terms:

-2C + 80 = 70

Subtract 80 from both sides:

-2C = -10

Divide both sides by -2:

C = 5

So, there are 5 chickens on the farm."
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, let's find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. 

Total slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

There are 4 people in total, including Henry and his 3 friends. 

Slices per person = Total slices / Number of people = 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person

The final answer is: 14"
