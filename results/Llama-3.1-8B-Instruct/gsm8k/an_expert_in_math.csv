"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

Now, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. 

So, she makes 9 * 2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can calculate the white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber to get the total:

Total bolts = Blue fiber + White fiber
Total bolts = 2 bolts + 1 bolt
Total bolts = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we need to first find the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

Let's denote the new value of the house as x. We can set up the equation:

x = 80,000 + 50,000
x = 130,000

However, the value of the house increased by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original value and add it to the original value.

150% of 80,000 is 1.5 * 80,000 = 120,000

Now, we add this to the original value:
130,000 + 120,000 = 250,000

So, the new value of the house is $250,000.

To find the profit, we subtract the original cost of the house from the new value:
Profit = New value - Original cost
Profit = 250,000 - 80,000
Profit = 170,000

The final answer is: $170,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total number of meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sprint sessions he does in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James does this 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find the total number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to find the total number of cups of feed she gives her chickens in a day. 

In the morning, she gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens 25 cups of feed. So, the total number of cups of feed she gives her chickens in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi gives each of her chickens 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in a day is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Since she has already given her chickens 40 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon, the number of cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * 5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * 3 = $1.8. 
We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass. 

So, the cost of the glasses can be represented as an arithmetic sequence: 5, 3, 1.8, 1.08, 0.64, 0.384, 0.2304, 0.13824, 0.0829376, 0.0493616, 0.02961856, 0.0177669376, 0.01066056576, 0.006396339456, 0.003788169728, 0.0022679997312.

However, we can also use a formula to find the sum of the series. The first term is 5, the common ratio is 0.6, and the number of terms is 16. 

The sum of the series can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a geometric series: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

S = 5 * (1 - 0.6^16) / (1 - 0.6)

S = 5 * (1 - 0.00006103515625) / 0.4

S = 5 * 0.99993896484375 / 0.4

S = 5 * 2.49959726671875

S = 12.49748633359375

The total cost is approximately $12.50.

The final answer is: $12.50"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   Since Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

2. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   Since Charleston has 80 sheep, Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add up the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
160 (Toulouse) + 80 (Charleston) + 20 (Seattle) = 260

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, add the time it takes to install the updates, and then add the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, let's find the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file:
40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB
Time to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Next, let's find the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file:
60% of 200 GB = 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB
Time to download 120 GB = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file:
Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the distance traveled in each segment.

1. First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. The distance traveled in this segment is:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

2. Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is traveled in this segment.

3. Next, he drives for 0.5 hours (half an hour) at 30 mph. The distance traveled in this segment is:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

4. Finally, he drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (4 - 2.5 hours) at 80 mph. The distance traveled in this segment is:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

Now, we add up the distances traveled in each segment to find the total distance from home:
Total distance = 180 + 0 + 15 + 120 = 315 miles

The final answer is: 315"
"To find Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately, then add them together.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime pay rate is:
$10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

Her earnings for the overtime hours are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Her total earnings for the week are:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads from each month together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"

"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total revenue it generates each year.

The initial cost of the tree is $90. 

Each year, the tree generates revenue from selling lemons. Since the tree grows 7 lemons per year and each lemon sells for $1.5, the total revenue per year is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

However, it also costs $3 to water and feed the tree each year. So, the net revenue per year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

To find out how many years it will take for the tree to start earning money, we need to find the break-even point, which is when the total revenue equals the initial cost of the tree.

Let's denote the number of years as 'n'. The total revenue after 'n' years is $7.5n, and the total cost is $90. We want to find the smallest 'n' such that $7.5n ≥ $90.

Dividing both sides by $7.5, we get n ≥ 12.

Since 'n' represents the number of years, it must be an integer. Therefore, the smallest 'n' that satisfies the inequality is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with ""x"". So, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. Now, she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of (x - x/3 - 2) is (x - x/3 - 2)/2.

4. After selling at the orange house, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation: x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5.

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x - 2x/3 - 4 - (x - x/3 - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 2x - 2x/3 - x + x/3 - 2 - 4 = 10.

Combine like terms: -x/3 - 6 = 10.

Add 6 to both sides: -x/3 = 16.

Multiply both sides by -3: x = -48.

However, the number of vacuum cleaners cannot be negative. This means that the initial equation was not set up correctly. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem:

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. Now, she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of (x - x/3 - 2) is (x - x/3 - 2)/2.

4. After selling at the orange house, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation: x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5.

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x - 2x/3 - 4 - (x - x/3 - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 2x - 2x/3 - x + x/3 - 2 - 4 = 10.

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 6 to get rid of the fraction: 6x - 2x - 12 - 3(x - x/3 - 2) = 30.

Combine like terms: 4x - 12 - 3x + x + 6 = 30.

"To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is 4, and the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance is also 4. So, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To maximize profit, we need to calculate the future value of both options. 

For the jewelry option, the future value is:

For the electronic gadgets option, the future value is:
$8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096

Since the future value of the electronic gadgets option is higher, the merchant should choose this option.

The profit is the difference between the future value and the initial cost:
$8,096 - $8,000 = $96

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. 

On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance.

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles.

"To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

In 4 weeks, she will eat 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat in 4 weeks.

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs.

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to find the total time she has available to complete the hike. 

She has already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and 2 miles in another hour, so she has walked a total of 6 miles in 2 hours. 

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and she has already walked 6 miles, so she has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left to walk.

Since she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, and the total distance is 12 miles, the total time she needs to complete the hike is 12 / 4 = 3 hours.

She has already used 2 hours, so she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time: 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

"To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. 

Two-thirds of 10 liters = (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters (approximately)

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the remaining one-third is not water. So, the amount of non-water in the orange drink is 10 - 6.67 = 3.33 liters.

Now, let's find the amount of water in the pineapple drink. Three-fifths of 15 liters = (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

The total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before spilling is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

When 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, the amount of water spilled is 6.67 * (1/10) = 0.667 liters (since 1/10 of the orange drink is water).

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 15.67 - 0.667 = 15 liters.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to set up an equation. Let's call the original price ""x"".

Since Kyle bought the book with a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of the original price, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so we can set up the equation:

x - 0.25x = 19.50

Combine like terms:

0.75x = 19.50

Now, divide both sides by 0.75 to solve for x:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

Total cost of chicken, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Now, we need to subtract the total cost of the chicken, milk, and apples from the total amount Marie paid to find the cost of the pizza boxes.

Cost of pizza boxes: $50 - $33 = $17

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can divide the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box to find the number of boxes.

Number of boxes of pizza: $17 / $8.50 = 2

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 cartons of ice cream for 60 days (1 carton per day).

Each carton has 15 servings, so to find the total number of cartons she needs, we divide the total number of days by the number of servings per carton:
60 days / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the total number of cartons by the cost per carton:
4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

"To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 from 60. 

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance of the first stop and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

20 - 45 is incorrect, as 45 is the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip, not the distance from the first stop. 

To find the correct distance, we need to find the distance from the first stop to the second stop. Since the first stop was at 20 miles, and the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, we can find the distance from the first stop to the second stop by subtracting 15 from 20 and then subtracting that result from 20. 

However, that is incorrect. We can simply find the distance from the first stop to the second stop by subtracting the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip from the distance of the first stop. 

20 - 45 is incorrect. 

The correct way to find the distance from the first stop to the second stop is to find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip and then subtract that from the distance of the first stop. However, that is also incorrect. 

The correct way to find the distance from the first stop to the second stop is to find the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and then subtract the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip from that result. 

The distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 60 - 20 = 40 miles. 

Now, we can find the distance from the first stop to the second stop by subtracting the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. 

40 - 15 = 25 miles

The distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops is 25 miles.

"Let's denote the cost of the boots as B and the cost of the more expensive pair of heels as H. We know that the cost of the less expensive pair of heels is $33. We also know that the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. 

Since the more expensive pair of heels costs twice as much as the less expensive pair, we can express the cost of the more expensive pair as 2 * 33 = 66 dollars.

We can now set up an equation to represent the situation: B = 33 + 66 - 5. 

Simplifying the equation, we get B = 94.

The final answer is: $94"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x, where x is a constant.
2. The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162, so we can write the equation: 7x + 11x = 162
3. Combine like terms: 18x = 162
4. Divide both sides by 18: x = 9
5. Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age: Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99
6. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age: Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog. 

Number of dogs: 10
Time spent on each dog: 0.5 hours

Total time spent in a day = Number of dogs * Time spent on each dog
Total time spent in a day = 10 * 0.5
Total time spent in a day = 5 hours

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the total time spent in a day by 7 to find the total time spent in a week.

Total time spent in a week = Total time spent in a day * 7

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We are given that G = S + 30.

We also know that the total number of coins is 110, so S + G = 110.

Substituting G = S + 30 into the second equation, we get S + (S + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2S = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30: G = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"

"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. 
25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point. 
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in both periods: 
4 points (first 20 minutes) + 5 points (second 20 minutes) = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first find out how much he spends per day and then multiply it by 30.

Since Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, and they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out the cost of 2 yogurts. 

To find the cost of 2 yogurts, we can divide the total cost of 4 yogurts ($5.00) by 2. 

Cost of 2 yogurts = $5.00 / 2 = $2.50

Now, we multiply the cost of 2 yogurts by the number of days (30) to find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days.

Total cost = $2.50 * 30 = $75.00

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many Lego sets John has left, we first need to calculate how much money he made from selling the Lego sets and then subtract the cost of the video games and the remaining money.

John sells 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is:
13 * 15 = 195 dollars

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is:
8 * 20 = 160 dollars

He also has $5 left after buying the video games, so the total amount of money he spent is:
195 - 5 = 190 dollars

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the total amount made to find out how much money he has left:
195 - 190 = 5 dollars

However, the question asks for the number of Lego sets he still has, not the amount of money he has left. Since he sold all his Lego sets initially, the amount of money he has left is not related to the number of Lego sets he has. The problem statement is incomplete or misleading, as it implies that the number of Lego sets he has left is related to the money he has left, which is not the case.

However, if we assume that the problem is asking for the number of Lego sets he would have if he had not sold them all, we can use the money he has left to find out how many Lego sets he could have sold. Since he has $5 left, and he made $15 per Lego set, we can divide the money he has left by the price per Lego set to find out how many Lego sets he could have sold:
5 / 15 = 1/3

However, this is not the number of Lego sets he has left, but rather the number of Lego sets he could have sold if he had not sold all of them. The problem statement is still incomplete or misleading.

Since the problem statement is unclear, I will provide a possible interpretation of the problem. If we assume that John sold all his Lego sets and then bought the video games, the number of Lego sets he has left is 0, as he sold all of them initially."
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his total running time and then divide the total distance by the total time.

John runs 3 hours the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

Total running time = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours

Since John runs 3 days a week, we need to multiply the total running time by 3 to get the total weekly running time: 6 hours * 3 = 18 hours

Now, we can calculate John's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time: 60 miles / 18 hours = 3.33 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 3.33"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
2. She can skip at a rate that is half as fast as she can run, so her running speed is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.
3. She can run at a rate four times faster than she can walk, so her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.
4. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, so she spends 2 hours running and 4 hours walking in 6 hours.

Now, let's calculate the distance she travels:

- Distance traveled while running: speed * time = 6 * 2 = 12 miles
- Distance traveled while walking: speed * time = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles

Total distance traveled: 12 + 6 = 18 miles

"To find the distance Polly can stand outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon, we need to find the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone and then add that to the distance of the dragon's flames.

When Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. To find the distance outside the dragon's reach, we need to add the distance the javelin can travel to the distance of the dragon's flames. 

Distance outside the dragon's reach = Distance the javelin can travel + Distance of the dragon's flames
= 1200 + 1000
= 2200 feet

"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total cost. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, and Charlie makes 10 candles from one pound of beeswax, the cost per candle is $1.00. 

Now, let's find the total cost for 20 candles: 
Total cost = cost per candle * number of candles
Total cost = $1.00 * 20
Total cost = $20.00

Next, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles:
Total revenue = price per candle * number of candles
Total revenue = $2.00 * 20
Total revenue = $40.00

Now, let's find the net profit:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
She wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles on Wednesday.

Total number of articles written in 3 days = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 * 4 = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to subtract the total number of Post-it notes she had initially and the ones she used from the total number of Post-it notes she had at the end.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

The total number of Post-it notes she had at the end is 80 (initial) + x (from the package) - 220 (used) + 23 (remaining).

We can set up the equation: 80 + x - 220 + 23 = total Post-it notes at the end.

Simplifying the equation: x - 117 = total Post-it notes at the end.

Since Candice had 23 Post-it notes remaining, we can set up the equation: x - 117 = 23 + 220.

Simplifying the equation: x - 117 = 243.

Adding 117 to both sides: x = 360.

The final answer is: 360"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find the number of blue ties, we divide the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie:
   Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
   Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
   Number of blue ties = 5

2. Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:
   Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
   Number of red ties = 2 * 5
   Number of red ties = 10

3. The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. This means the cost of each red tie is 1.5 times the cost of each blue tie:
   Cost of each red tie = 1.5 * Cost of each blue tie
   Cost of each red tie = 1.5 * $40
   Cost of each red tie = $60

4. To find the total amount spent on red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie:
   Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
   Total amount spent on red ties = 10 * $60
   Total amount spent on red ties = $600

5. To find the total amount spent on ties, we add the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:
   Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
   Total amount spent on ties = $200 + $600
   Total amount spent on ties = $800

"To find the total time Tom's ship takes to travel from 1 to 4 PM and back, we need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the journey separately.

The distance from 1 to 4 PM is 3 miles (assuming it's a linear distance, as the time of day doesn't affect the distance). 

Time taken to travel from 1 to 4 PM = Distance / Speed = 3 miles / 10 mph = 0.3 hours.

Since the time is given in hours, we can convert it to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 
0.3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 18 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time taken to travel back from 4 to 1 PM. The distance remains the same, 3 miles.

Time taken to travel from 4 to 1 PM = Distance / Speed = 3 miles / 6 mph = 0.5 hours.

Converting 0.5 hours to minutes:
0.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 30 minutes.

The total time taken for the round trip is the sum of the time taken for each leg:
Total time = 18 minutes + 30 minutes = 48 minutes.

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books already removed weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys to be removed is:

7.5 / (1/2) = 7.5 * 2 = 15

Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Revenue from car tires on Friday: 12 car tires * $40 per tire = $480

Since the revenue from car tires on Friday ($480) is higher than the revenue from both truck and car tires on Thursday ($520), we need to compare the revenue from car tires on Friday with the total revenue on Thursday.

Total from marigolds: 12 pots * $3/pot = $36
Total from petunias: 9 pots * $2/pot = $18
Total from begonias: 17 pots * $2/pot = $34

Now, let's add the total amount from each type of flower to find the overall total:

$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

"To find the average square footage of a level, we need to find the total square footage of all levels and then divide it by the number of levels.

The top level has a square footage of 16. Since each level below it has half the square footage, the second level will have 16 / 2 = 8 square footage. The third level will have 8 / 2 = 4 square footage, and the fourth level will have 4 / 2 = 2 square footage.

The total square footage of all levels is 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

There are 4 levels in total. 

The average square footage of a level is 30 / 4 = 7.5.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To find the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days. So, the total number of cups of dog food eaten in the first 180 days is 180 * 1 = 180 cups.

The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the total number of cups of dog food eaten in the remaining days is 185 * 2 = 370 cups.

The total number of cups of dog food eaten in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year is 550 / 110 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

Now, let's find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
= 200 - 100

"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package. 

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers is the better deal.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 
18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages of 2 flowers.
9 packages of 2 flowers * $1 per package = $9.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the more expensive price.
18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages of 3 flowers.
6 packages of 3 flowers * $2.50 per package = $15.

The difference in cost is $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"

"Let's denote the number of games the team lost as L and the number of games they won as W. We are given that W = L + 8 and that the total number of games played is 22, so L + W = 22.

We can substitute W from the first equation into the second equation: L + (L + 8) = 22.

Combine like terms: 2L + 8 = 22.

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2L = 14.

Divide both sides by 2: L = 7.

Now that we know L, we can find W: W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to first calculate her salary after 5 years of service, and then calculate the increase for the next 3 years.

Initial salary: $600
Increase after 5 years: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 5 years: $600 + $60 = $660

Now, we need to calculate the increase for the next 3 years. Since the increase is 10% of the current salary, we will apply the increase to the salary after 5 years.

Increase after 6 years: 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 6 years: $660 + $66 = $726

Increase after 7 years: 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 7 years: $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Increase after 8 years: 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 8 years: $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Increase after 9 years: 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.85

"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will actually show up. Since 1/4 of the guests don't show up, 3/4 of the guests will show up. 

3/4 * 16 = (3 * 16) / 4 = 48 / 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, and 12 guests will show up, she will need 0.75 * 12 = 9 gift bags.

The cost of each gift bag is $2, so the total cost will be 9 * 2 = $18.

1. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats.
2. There are two cats for every dog.
3. The number of dogs is 60.

Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120.

The combined number of dogs and cats is 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180.

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so the number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168.

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348.

- Friday: 2 episodes of 1-hour shows = 2 * 1 = 2 hours

Total hours watched = 2 + x + 1.5 + 2 = 7

Combine like terms: 5.5 + x = 7

Subtract 5.5 from both sides: x = 1.5

Since x represents the number of 30-minute episodes, and there are 2 30-minute segments in a 1-hour episode, we need to convert x to the number of 30-minute episodes. However, since x is already in hours, we can directly convert it to 30-minute episodes by multiplying by 2.

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed and multiply it by 2 liters per set. 

First, let's find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed in 64 seconds. Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the rate of rowing in feet per second. 

Rate = Distance / Time = 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second

Now, we can find the total distance rowed in 64 seconds.

Distance = Rate * Time = 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can find the number of sets of 10 feet by dividing the total distance by 10.

Number of sets = Total distance / 10 = 80 feet / 10 = 8 sets

Now, we can find the total amount of water taken on by multiplying the number of sets by 2 liters per set.

"To find the total cost of the lumber, we need to calculate the cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards and the 4 x 4 x 10 boards separately and then add them together.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 per board = $100.

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. 

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 per board.
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 per board.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.
The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 per board = $120.

Initially, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

On the second day, the total number of vehicles became 30. To find the number of vehicles added on the second day, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added on the second day by 5: 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. This means that if Adrien's salary is A, then Lylah's salary is A / 1.3 (since 100% + 30% = 130%, or 1.3 times).

2. We know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000. Since his salary increased by 40% four years later, his new salary is 40000 * 1.4 = $56000.

3. Since Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, and Lylah's salary was 1/1.3 times Adrien's, Lylah's salary four years ago was 40000 / 1.3 = $30769.23.

4. Since their salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's new salary is 30769.23 * 1.4 = $43059.52.

5. To find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later, we add their new salaries: 56000 + 43059.52 = $99059.52.

The final answer is: $99059.52"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to first find out how many sheets he uses in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, the number of sheets he uses in a week is:
2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the number of sheets he uses in a month is:
60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then add them together.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples.
Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each person brought:
Morisette: 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits
Kael: 10 apples + 4 oranges = 14 fruits

The total number of fruits they have is 13 + 14 = 27."
"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to break down her sleep into different parts.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

The rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday) she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept for each part of the week:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday and Wednesday: 2 days * 6 hours = 12 hours
- Thursday to Sunday: 5 days * 7 hours = 35 hours

Now, let's add up the total hours she slept throughout the week:
8 + 12 + 35 = 55

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours:
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Now, let's calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distances together to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:
Total distance = Distance at 10 miles/hour + Distance at 5 miles/hour
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. This means she stamps 1/3 * 60 = 20 letters.
2. After stamping 20 letters, the number of letters needing stamps is reduced to 60 - 20 = 40.
3. We are given that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.
4. Since Jennie stamped 20 letters, the number of letters in the already-stamped pile before she started is 30 - 20 = 10.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons while making the stew.
4. After using the spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as 'x'. 

From point 2, we know that Julia had 'x' spoons initially. 
From point 3, we know that after using 3 spoons, she had 'x - 3' spoons left.
From point 4, we know that after her husband gave her 5 more spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons.

So, we can set up the equation: x - 3 + 5 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages.

Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 
He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

To find the total number of sausages, we add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages: 38 + 44 = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we need to find the number of friends Amy has and add it to the number of friends Lily has.

Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily made 50 friends, Amy made 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

Now, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to find the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity.

Let's start with the cost of a pepper, which is given as $15.

Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * 15 = $45.

An orange costs 5 dollars less than what a watermelon costs, so the cost of an orange is 45 - 5 = $40.

Now, we can find the total cost of each item by multiplying the cost by the quantity:

- Watermelons: 4 * 45 = $180
- Peppers: 20 * 15 = $300
- Oranges: 10 * 40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of the costs of all items: 180 + 300 + 400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total amount charged to patients, then subtract the cost of doctors from the revenue.

First, let's find the total time spent by doctors:
500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total minutes to hours:
12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The total cost of doctors is:
200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

Now, let's find the total amount charged to patients:
500 patients * 24 minutes/patient * ($200/hour) = 500 * 24 * ($200/60)
= 500 * 4 * $200
= $200000

The total profit is:
$200000 - $30000 = $170000

The final answer is: $170000"
"To find the number of elves left, we need to follow the steps:

1. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. Since there are 60 elves initially, a third of them is 60 / 3 = 20. So, 20 elves quit.

2. Now, there are 60 - 20 = 40 elves left.

3. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, we subtract 10 from the remaining elves: 40 - 10 = 30.

Therefore, the number of elves left is 30.

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides each person took and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she rode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides is 4 (Pam's rides) + 6 (Fred's rides) = 10 rides.

Each ride costs 6 tickets, so the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first determine how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

Since Walt walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, we can calculate the miles walked on Tuesday as follows:
Miles walked on Tuesday = 6 * miles walked on Monday
= 6 * 4
= 24 miles

Now, we know that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. We already know the miles walked on Monday (4 miles) and Tuesday (24 miles). To find the miles walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage:
Miles walked on Wednesday = Total mileage - (Miles walked on Monday + Miles walked on Tuesday)
= 41 - (4 + 24)
= 41 - 28
= 13 miles

Tom gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15. 

Total cost per month = Number of car washes per month * Cost per car wash
Total cost per month = 4 * $15
Total cost per month = $60

Now, we multiply the total cost per month by 12 to get the total cost per year.

Total cost per year = Total cost per month * 12
Total cost per year = $60 * 12
Total cost per year = $720

"To find the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed in both tests and subtract that from the total number of questions in both tests.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

Time taken to complete the first test = Total questions / Rate per hour
Time taken to complete the first test = 75 / 5
Time taken to complete the first test = 15 hours

Since Mark had 8 hours, he completed the first test in 8 hours, not 15. So, the number of questions he completed in the first test is:
Questions completed in the first test = Rate per hour * Time taken
Questions completed in the first test = 5 * 8
Questions completed in the first test = 40

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.

Time taken to complete the second test = Total questions / Rate per hour
Time taken to complete the second test = 100 / 5
Time taken to complete the second test = 20 hours

Since Mark had 6 hours, he completed 6/5 of the second test. So, the number of questions he completed in the second test is:
Questions completed in the second test = Rate per hour * Time taken
Questions completed in the second test = 5 * 6
Questions completed in the second test = 30

Total questions completed = Questions completed in the first test + Questions completed in the second test
Total questions completed = 40 + 30
Total questions completed = 70

Total questions in both tests = 75 + 100
Total questions in both tests = 175

Number of manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100

"Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q.

We are given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.

We are also given that there are twice as many babies as queens, so B = 2Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 2B and B = 2Q into the equation W + B + Q = 700, we get:

2B + B + Q = 700
3B + Q = 700

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation 3B + Q = 700 to get:

3(2Q) + Q = 700
6Q + Q = 700
7Q = 700

Dividing both sides by 7, we get:

Q = 100

Now that we know Q = 100, we can find B by substituting Q into the equation B = 2Q:

B = 2(100)
B = 200

Now that we know B = 200, we can find W by substituting B into the equation W = 2B:

W = 2(200)
W = 400

Non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
Total cost of non-food items: 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
Tax = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax to the cost of non-food items:
Total cost of non-food items with tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax:
Total cost = 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

"To find the total profit, we first need to calculate the total income and total expenses. 

Kim has 3 current clients and 5 potential clients, making a total of 8 clients. Each client will need 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths, so the total number of bottles of bleach needed is 8 * 2 = 16, and the total number of packs of cloths needed is 8 * 1 = 8.

The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle, so the total cost of bleach is 16 * $2 = $32. The cost of cloths is $5 per pack, so the total cost of cloths is 8 * $5 = $40.

The total expenses are the sum of the cost of bleach and the cost of cloths, which is $32 + $40 = $72.

Kim's total income is $92. 

The profit is the difference between the total income and the total expenses, which is $92 - $72 = $20.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.
3. The number of bees that have left the hive so far is 30 (initially left) + 30 (left in the next 6 hours) = 60 bees. 
4. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees leave the hive. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave the hive.
5. The number of bees that have left the hive so far is 60 (initially left) + 60 (left in the next 6 hours) = 120 bees.
6. Every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours. This means all the bees that left in the first 6 hours (30 bees) and the bees that left in the next 6 hours (60 bees) return. However, we already know that 15 bees returned in the second 6 hours, so the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is 30 (initially left) + 60 (left in the next 6 hours) - 15 (already returned) = 75 bees.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy.
- James has four times as many friends as Dorothy.
- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook.

Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can represent the number of Dorothy's friends as x. This means Charlie has 3x friends.

We know Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation: 3x = 12

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 12 / 3
x = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find the number of James' friends. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so James has 4 * 4 = 16 friends.

"To find out who wins the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

Steve's distance is 3 miles, which is 5280 feet (since 1 mile = 5280 feet). His speed is 440 feet per minute. 

Time taken by Steve = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Steve = 5280 / 440
Time taken by Steve = 12 minutes

Tim's distance is 2 miles, which is 10560 feet (since 1 mile = 5280 feet). His speed is 264 feet per minute.

Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Tim = 10560 / 264
Time taken by Tim = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 12 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve wins the race.

To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to find the difference in their times.

Difference in time = Time taken by Tim - Time taken by Steve

"To find the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires. 

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and there were 5 bicycles. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * 25 cents = 250 cents. 

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and there were 3 tricycles. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * 25 cents = 225 cents.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and there was 1 unicycle. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1.

The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * 25 cents = 25 cents.

Now, let's add up the total cost of inflating all the tires: 250 cents + 225 cents + 25 cents = 500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total number of fries eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21.
3. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, and there were 3 pigeons, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
   Now, the total number of fries eaten is 21 + 9 = 30.
4. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's denote the total number of fries initially as x. 
   After the pigeons ate, the remaining fries are x - 30.
   The raccoon ate 2/3 of (x - 30), which is (2/3)(x - 30).
   The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30).
   Simplifying this, we get (1/3)(x - 30).
5. After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind. 
   So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.
   Solving for x, we get (1/3)(x - 30) = 6.
   Multiplying both sides by 3, we get x - 30 = 18.
   Adding 30 to both sides, we get x = 48.

"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes per day, each lasting 1 hour. So, the total hours per day for these days is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. Since there are 3 days, the total hours per week for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes per day, each lasting 2 hours. So, the total hours per day for these days is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. Since there are 2 days, the total hours per week for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week is the sum of the hours for the two sets of days: 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

The final answer is: 272"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together:

1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12:

3360 / 12 = 280 feet

The final answer is: 280"
"To find the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to calculate the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape per month and then multiply it by 2.

Monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.
Gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
Baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, we add the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. 

To find the total distance Kelly ran, we add the distance she ran back and forth and the distance she ran to the 40-yard line and back. So, the total distance Kelly ran is 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance. So, 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: 80"

"To find the depth of the water on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

On Monday, the depth of the water is 17 feet.

On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth of the water on Tuesday is:
17 + 7 = 24 feet

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3:
(2/3) * 24 = (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we need to add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish he caught.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.

Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Total fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin = 19 + 13 = 32

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We are given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation:

S = 2B

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This means that in 2 years, Seth's age will be S + 2 and Brooke's age will be B + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation:

S + 2 + B + 2 = 28

Combine like terms:

S + B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

S + B = 24

Now we can substitute S = 2B into this equation:

2B + B = 24

Combine like terms:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

2. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
3. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo.
4. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.

From point 3, we know Sally Four is 8 years old. 
From point 2, we know Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.
From point 1, we know Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of three birds: Sally Four (8), Granny Red (16), and Sally Two (19). 
The only bird left is the one at the Caboose, which is Sally Thirtytwo, and we already know she is 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much they made in total from selling lemonade and then subtract the cost of sugar to find the cost of lemons.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the total revenue per gallon is:
   20 glasses/gallon * $0.50/glass = $10/gallon

2. They made a profit of $25, so their total revenue is:
   Total revenue = Profit + Cost
   Total revenue = $25 + Cost

3. Since they sell each gallon for $10, the number of gallons they sold is:
   Total revenue = Number of gallons * $10/gallon
   $25 + Cost = Number of gallons * $10/gallon

4. We can now solve for the number of gallons:
   Number of gallons = ($25 + Cost) / $10

5. Since they made a profit, the cost must be less than the revenue. Let's assume the cost is x. Then the number of gallons is:
   Number of gallons = ($25 + x) / $10

6. The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. The cost of sugar per gallon is $2, so the cost of lemons per gallon is:
   Cost of lemons per gallon = $5 - $2 = $3

7. The total cost of lemons is the cost of lemons per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons:
   Total cost of lemons = Cost of lemons per gallon * Number of gallons
   Total cost of lemons = $3 * (($25 + x) / $10)

8. Since we want to find the cost of lemons, we can set up an equation using the information that the total cost is less than the total revenue:
   $3 * (($25 + x) / $10) < $25 + x

9. We can simplify the equation:
   $3 * (2.5 + x/10) < $25 + x
   $7.5 + $0.3x < $25 + x

10. Now we can solve for x:
   $0.3x - x < $25 - $7.5
   -$0.7x < $17.5
   x > -$17.5 / 0.7
   x > -$25

11. Since x is the total cost, it must be a positive number. We can try different values of x to find the one that satisfies the equation.

12. Let's try x = $25:
   Number of gallons = ($25 + $25) / $10 = 3
   Total cost of lemons = $3 * 3 = $9

13. Since the total cost is $25 and the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon, the total cost of lemons is:
   Total cost of lemons = Total cost - Cost of sugar
   Total cost of lemons = $25 - ($2 * 3)
   Total cost of lemons = $25 - $6
   Total cost of lemons = $19

Mark - 2 = (1/2)Jan - 5

Since we know Jan is 30, we can substitute that value into the equation:
Mark - 2 = (1/2)(30) - 5
Mark - 2 = 15 - 5
Mark - 2 = 10
Mark = 12

Now that we know Mark is 12, we can find Jean's age using point 1:
Jean = Mark + 2
Jean = 12 + 2
Jean = 14

"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the time for each runner on the less well-rounded team and add them up.

The first runner on the less well-rounded team runs 60 seconds. 
The second runner runs 3 seconds faster than the first, so 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second, so 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third, so 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we add up the times for the less well-rounded team: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The well-rounded team's total time is 4 x 55 = 220 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to count the favorable outcomes and divide by the total number of outcomes. 

The favorable outcomes for rolling a number greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes. The total number of outcomes is 6 (since it's a six-sided die). 

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to count the favorable outcomes and divide by the total number of outcomes. 

The favorable outcomes for rolling two even numbers in a row are (2,2), (2,4), (2,6), (4,2), (4,4), (4,6), (6,2), (6,4), and (6,6). There are 9 favorable outcomes. The total number of outcomes is 6^2 = 36 (since it's a six-sided die and we're rolling it twice).

So, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 9/36 = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

Now, to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row, we need to subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.

Difference in probability = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Difference in probability = 0.25 * 100 = 25%

The hamsters are kept in 10 cages, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of straw pieces distributed among the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The rabbits are given 20 pieces of straw.

The total number of straw pieces distributed among the hamsters and the rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 70 pieces are distributed among the hamsters and the rabbits, the remaining straw pieces are distributed among the rats. 

So, the number of straw pieces distributed among the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's assume the number of rats in each cage is 'r'. Then, the total number of rats is 3r.

The total number of straw pieces distributed among the rats is 6 * 3r = 18r.

Since the number of straw pieces distributed among the rats is 90, we can set up the equation 18r = 90.

To solve for 'r', we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

r = 90 / 18
r = 5

"To find the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The monthly interest rate is 2%, which can be represented as 0.02 in decimal form. 

The initial amount owed is $100.

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

To find the total interest, we add the interest for each month: $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

Now, we add the total interest to the initial amount: $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

Rounded to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost and the total revenue of the trader. 

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is the sum of the cost of buying and transporting the bags, which is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue is the selling price of each bag multiplied by the number of bags, which is $30x.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $30x - $22x = $8x.

We are given that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation $8x = $400.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

The trader sold 50 bags."
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. The cost of the tickets is $20.25, and they spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. So, the cost of the food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of peaches he collects per minute by the number of minutes he collects peaches.

Since John collects peaches for 3 hours, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches he collects per minute:

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks need per day, we first need to find out how many pounds of insects they need per week. Since there are 10 ducks and each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we multiply the number of ducks by the amount of insects each duck needs per week.

10 ducks * 3.5 pounds/duck/week = 35 pounds/week

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total amount of insects needed per week by 7 to find out how many pounds of insects the flock needs per day.

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the total number of trees he has after 10 years, and then subtract the number of trees that die.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees.

Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. So, the net change in the number of trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8.

After 10 years, the total number of trees he has is 50 + (8 * 10) = 50 + 80 = 130.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3 (which is 30% as a decimal).

Number of trees that die = 130 * 0.3 = 39

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees he has after 10 years.

Number of trees left = 130 - 39 = 91

The final answer is: 91"
"To find the number of pink and white flamingos, we need to break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard. So, the number of white flamingos is 6.

The number of pink flamingos left is 18 - 6 = 12.

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is now 12 + 18 = 30.

The difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many crayons Violetta can buy, we need to divide the amount of money she has by the cost of one crayon. 

Number of crayons = Total money / Cost of one crayon
Number of crayons = $20 / $2
Number of crayons = 10

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color.

Total number of crayons she can buy = 2 * 5
Total number of crayons she can buy = 10

Since she can buy 10 crayons in total and she needs 5 different colors, she will buy 2 of each color.

Now, let's find out how much change she will get. 

Change = Total money - Total cost of crayons
Change = $20 - (2 * 5 * $2)
Change = $20 - $20
Change = $0

Violetta will get $0 change."
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser, since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined.

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens.
Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12

"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to calculate the total pounds of carrots distributed and subtract that from the initial amount.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots distributed = 2 pounds/restaurant * 40 restaurants
Total pounds of carrots distributed = 80 pounds

Now, subtract the total pounds of carrots distributed from the initial amount:

Initial amount of carrots = 200 pounds
Total pounds of carrots distributed = 80 pounds

Pounds of carrots not used = Initial amount of carrots - Total pounds of carrots distributed
Pounds of carrots not used = 200 - 80
Pounds of carrots not used = 120

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mark edits 1000 sentences each week.
2. Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.
3. Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence.
4. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.
5. The total amount Mark makes from Publisher A is 500 * 5 = 2500 cents.
6. The total amount Mark makes from Publisher B is 500 * 10 = 5000 cents.

"To find the total amount John made that year, we need to calculate his new salary after the 5% raise and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise:
5% of 2000 = 0.05 * 2000 = 100

New salary = old salary + raise = 2000 + 100 = 2100

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the new salary by 52:
Total amount = new salary * 52 = 2100 * 52 = 109200

Now, let's add the one-time monetary reward of $5000:
Total amount = 109200 + 5000 = 114200

1. Slices used for sandwiches: 
   - Number of days: 7 (since he ate a sandwich every day for a week)
   - Slices per sandwich: 2
   - Total slices for sandwiches: 7 * 2 = 14

2. Slices used for omelets: 
   - Number of days: 3 (since he ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days)
   - Slices per omelet: 2 + 1 = 3 (since he used one more slice per omelet than per sandwich)
   - Total slices for omelets: 3 * 3 = 9

3. Slices used for macaroni and cheese: 
   - Number of slices: 8

Now, let's add the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish together:

"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of blue and red pens she bought and add them to the initial number of pens she had.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she had a total of 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens.

She bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, let's add the number of blue and red pens she bought to the initial number of pens she had: 54 + 12 = 66.

Adding the blue and red pens to the initial number of pens, we get: 32 + 66 = 98.

"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply 93 by 6 to get the total score.

Total score = Average * Number of tests
Total score = 93 * 6
Total score = 558

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the five test scores she has so far. The scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71.

Now, we add up the remaining four test scores and subtract the lowest score from the total score to find the total score she needs from the remaining four tests.

Total score from remaining tests = Total score - Lowest score
Total score from remaining tests = 558 - 71
Total score from remaining tests = 487

Now, we add the scores of the remaining four tests: 89, 92, 100, and 86.

Total of remaining tests = 89 + 92 + 100 + 86
Total of remaining tests = 367

Now, we subtract the total of the remaining tests from the total score from the remaining tests to find the score she needs on the sixth test.

"To find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs to earn and subtract the amount she already has.

The total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is $30 + $20 * 2 = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn. 

Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn as 'x'. Then, the total amount she earns from babysitting is $5 * 4 = $20. The total amount she earns from mowing the lawn is $4 * x.

The total amount she earns is $20 + $4x. Since she needs $70, we can set up the equation:

$20 + $4x = $70

Subtracting $20 from both sides gives us:

$4x = $50

Dividing both sides by $4 gives us:

x = 12.5

Since Sara can't mow the lawn a fraction of a time, she must mow the lawn 13 times to have enough money to buy the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We are given that W = R + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can set up the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

"To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"Let's break down the information given:

- The first day, Sloane counts 100 customers.
- The second day, she counts 50 more customers than the first day, so she counts 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
- The total number of customers by the third day is 500.

To find the number of customers on the third day, we need to subtract the total customers on the first two days from the total customers by the third day.

Total customers by the third day = Customers on the third day + Customers on the first two days
500 = Customers on the third day + (100 + 150)
500 = Customers on the third day + 250

Now, we can solve for the customers on the third day:
Customers on the third day = 500 - 250
Customers on the third day = 250

"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of change of water in each pool is -4 gallons/minute.

The change in water in the small pool over 4 minutes is -4 * 4 = -16 gallons.
The change in water in the big pool over 4 minutes is -4 * 4 = -16 gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:
2x - 16 = 4x - 64
-16 + 64 = 4x - 2x
48 = 2x
x = 24

So, the initial amount of water in the small pool was 24 gallons. 

Since the small pool lost 16 gallons over 4 minutes, the amount of water in the small pool now is:
24 - 16 = 8 gallons.

It takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester. 
It takes half as many days to travel by car, so it takes 6 / 2 = 3 days to travel by car from Rochester back to New Jersey.

The total number of days Andrew will travel is 6 (by bus) + 3 (by car) = 9 days.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we need to first find the total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type and buying 14 grass type.

Initial number of cards: 
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

After losing 8 water type cards: 
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 grass type cards: 
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 32

Total number of cards: 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

The number of water type cards: 32

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards: 
32 / 96 = 0.3333

To convert this to a percentage, multiply by 100: 
0.3333 * 100 = 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33."
"To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito is $6.50. 
He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, so 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. 
The total cost of the extra items is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.
The total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the new total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.
He has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find the total number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to add their individual rates. 

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, which is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute. 

So, together they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the total time it will take to complete the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate. 

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

"To find the number of melons not ready to be harvested after two weeks, we need to follow the steps below:

Initially, there were 120 watermelons.

After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. 
30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36 watermelons were ready for harvest.
So, the remaining watermelons = 120 - 36 = 84.

After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest.
3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63 watermelons were ready for harvest.
So, the remaining melons not ready for harvest = 84 - 63 = 21.

The final answer is: 21"

"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we first need to determine how many shells she collected on Monday. 

On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, so Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. To find out how many shells she collects on Tuesday, we multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2. 

25 * 2 = 50

So, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday.

"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to find the number of bugs and add it to the number of ants. 

Since there were half as many bugs as ants, and there were 50 ants, we can find the number of bugs by dividing the number of ants by 2.

Number of bugs = Number of ants / 2
= 50 / 2
= 25

Now, we can find the total number of insects by adding the number of bugs and ants.

Total number of insects = Number of bugs + Number of ants
= 25 + 50

"To find out how many vines Steve needs, we first need to determine how many tomatoes he eats per week. 

Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply this by 7 to get the total tomatoes he eats per week: 
6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve. 
So, his girlfriend eats 6/2 = 3 tomatoes/day. 
His girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

The total number of tomatoes they eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes per vine to find the number of vines needed: 
63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

The final answer is: 21"

"To find the total number of pens Ram gets, we need to calculate the number of new pens he can make from the 25 pens he buys.

Since Ram can make 1 new pen from 5 empty pens, he can make 25/5 = 5 new pens from the first 25 pens.

However, the 5 new pens he made will also run low on ink, so he can use them to make more pens. He can make 5/5 = 1 new pen from each of the 5 new pens.

So, from the 5 new pens, he can make 1 new pen. 

Now, he has 1 new pen from the 5 new pens and the original 25 pens. 

In total, he has 25 (original pens) + 1 (new pen from the 5 new pens) + 5 (new pens) = 31 pens.

The final answer is: 31"

"To find the total number of letters Mike receives, we need to multiply the number of pen pals he has left by the number of letters each sends per week. Since he stopped being pen pals with 2 people, he has 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals left.

Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week, so the total number of letters he receives is 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages per week.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, each 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he sends is 6 * 5 = 30 pages per week.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages per week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing per week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as x. After Ginger gave Griffin x fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now Griffin has (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. We know that in the end Griffin had 27 fries, so we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.
7. To solve for x, we subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: x = 27 - 7.
8. x = 20.

"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as x. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of students in the school is 100%. 

Let's find the total number of students in the school. Since each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, the total number of students is 20 * 3 = 60.

Now, we know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. The total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

Now, we know that the total number of girls in the first two classes is 27, and the total number of girls in the school is 30. So, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% boys, the total number of boys in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The final answer is: 762"
"To find the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

Each house has 3 bedrooms with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is 3 * 2 = 6. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12.

Each house has 4 additional windows not connected to bedrooms. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is 4 * 2 = 8.

The total number of windows in one house is 12 (from bedrooms) + 8 (additional) = 20. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows is 20 * 2 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first find the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. 
So, the total number of stitches for the body and the sleeves is 1800 - 270 = 1530 stitches.

The body takes 900 stitches, so the sleeves take 1530 - 900 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

The final answer is: 315"

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, and then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

Now, we find the number of cards remaining after removing the cards with the letter A:
80 - 32 = 48 cards

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B:
1/2 of 48 = (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards

Now, we find the number of cards remaining after removing the cards with the letter B:
48 - 24 = 24 cards

Then, we find the number of cards with the letter C:
5/8 of 24 = (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be m + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (m + 10).

We can substitute M + m = 20 into the equation (M + 10) + (m + 10) to get (20 + 10) + (20 + 10) = 30 + 30 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S.

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can write the equation: R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write the equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Now we can substitute R = 6S into the second equation: 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Expanding the equation, we get: 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get: 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get: 3S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: S = 6.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba. Let's denote the number of spots on a mamba as x. Then, the number of spots on a cobra is 2x.

2. We know that the cobra has 70 spots. So, we can set up the equation 2x = 70 to find the number of spots on a mamba.

3. Solving for x, we get x = 70 / 2 = 35. This means a mamba has 35 spots.

4. Now, we know that there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas in the snake park. The total number of spots on the cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800.

5. The total number of spots on the mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100.

6. The total number of spots on all the snakes is 2800 + 2100 = 4900.

7. To find half the number of spots, we divide the total number of spots by 2: 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"To find the total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for, we need to calculate the total number of team members, coaches, and guests. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. 
Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 
The total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas Maddy needs to buy is 39 / 3 = 13.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to first find the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace to find the length taken up by the sterling silver beads. 

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 of them, so the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. 

The length taken up by the sterling silver beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of beads, we divide the total length taken up by the beads by the length of each bead: 17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = 68.

The total number of stars in the 6-star rows is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

The total number of stars in the flag is 76.

The number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

"To find the time taken by the car in the fast lane, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

Given that the car in the fast lane traveled 480 miles at 60 miles/hour, we can calculate its time as follows:
time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours.

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, its speed is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the same formula to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane:
time = distance / speed = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ali has 22 medals.
2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
4. Together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, which means they have 1/10 of the total medals given out.

Let's represent the total medals given out as 'x'. Then, 1/10 of x is equal to 39. 

To find x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 10:
(1/10)x = 39
x = 39 * 10
x = 390

"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

Total time worked = 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the time from hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed, we need to first calculate their points after the fourth round.

Initially, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's calculate the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed:

"To find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day. 

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 3 meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). So, the total rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 3 = 0.6 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total rice consumed per day is 0.6 kg * 5 = 3 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per day (3 kg).

42 kg / 3 kg/day = 14 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many weeks the rice will last by dividing the number of days by 7.

14 days / 7 days/week = 2 weeks

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 2 weeks.

"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to determine the number of bids made by the other 3 people and Carmen, and then calculate the total amount bid.

Since Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, the total number of bids made by the other 3 people is 3. 

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so the total number of bids made by Carmen is 3 + 1 = 4.

The initial bid is $200, and each subsequent bid is $50 more than the previous one. 

The total number of bids is 3 (by the other people) + 4 (by Carmen) = 7.

The total amount bid is the sum of an arithmetic series with the first term a = 200, the last term l = 200 + 6*50 = 400, and the number of terms n = 7.

The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula: S = n/2 * (a + l)

Substituting the values, we get:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of pages and how they are arranged in the tabloid. 

When a piece of paper is folded, the front and back sides are created. For a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the number of pages on the left and right sides of the paper.

Since the pages are arranged in a specific order (page 1 on the left back, page 2 on the left front, page 32 on the right back, and page 31 on the right front), we can see that each page is printed on one side of the paper. 

However, when we fold the paper, the left and right sides are combined, so we need to consider the total number of pages that would be printed on each side of the paper.

For the left side, pages 1-16 would be printed on the left back and left front. For the right side, pages 17-32 would be printed on the right back and right front.

Since each side of the paper can hold 16 pages (8 on the back and 8 on the front), we need 2 pieces of paper to create a 32-page tabloid.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we need to calculate how much he has spent so far and subtract that from the total amount he has.

1. Cost of business suits: 6 suits * $100 = $600
2. Cost of suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 = $150
3. Cost of flight ticket: 5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500, and the flight ticket costs $700 more than that, so the cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200
4. Total cost so far: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950
5. Amount left after saving: $6000 - $2000 = $4000
6. Amount left after spending on business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket: $4000 - $1950 = $2050

So, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is $2050."
"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to first find the total number of eggs consumed in a day and then multiply it by 7.

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs consumed by these 3 people in a day is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs.

The rest of the family members are 5 - 3 = 2 people, and they eat 2 eggs each day. So, the total number of eggs consumed by these 2 people in a day is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Trent is 5 years older than Jane.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.
3. Quinn is 30 years old.

From point 2, we can deduce that Jane's age is 30 - 3 = 27 years old.

From point 1, we can deduce that Trent's age is Jane's age + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32 years old.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
2. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
3. The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60000.
4. The population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, so the current population is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

The final answer is: 120000"
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

The total number of players on the team is 105, which is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. 

We can write the equation: D + 2D + D/2 = 105

To solve for D, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2D + 4D + D = 210

Combine like terms: 7D = 210

Divide both sides by 7: D = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

For the 2 families with 6 people: 2 * 6 = 12 people
For the 3 families with 4 people: 3 * 4 = 12 people
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24 people

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, we subtract those from the total: 24 - 8 = 16 people

Then, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 2 people. So, we subtract those from the number of people who couldn't come due to illness: 8 - 2 = 6 people

Now, we subtract the people who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments from the total number of people invited: 24 - 6 = 18 people

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 (initial marbles) + 20 (marbles bought from Johanna) + 8 (marbles given by his father) = 98.

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of marbles is 98 * 2 = 196.

The final answer is: 196"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to find the volume of the pool. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L * W * H = 6 * 4 * 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost.

Cost per cubic foot = $0.1
Total cost = Volume * Cost per cubic foot = 120 * 0.1 = $12

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to find the number of girls and nongendered children and add them to the number of boys.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so the number of nongendered children is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

To find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The final answer is: 123"
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Let's assume the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people at the party was 25 + 15 = 40.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. To find the number of people who left, we multiply the total number of people by 1/4:

1/4 * 40 = 10

So, 10 people left the party.

Since 22 men stayed at the party, and there were initially 25 men, the number of men who left is:

25 - 22 = 3

Since 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is:

10 - 3 = 7

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 of them left. To find the number of women who stayed, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

15 - 7 = 8

Therefore, 8 women are left at the party.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The magazine costs half as much as the book.
2. The book costs $4.
3. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine.

From point 1, we know the magazine costs half of $4, which is $4 / 2 = $2.
From point 3, we know the pen costs $1 less than the magazine, which is $2 - $1 = $1.

The final numerical answer is: $1"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this:

3x + 2 = 26

where x is the number of pencils in each box. To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x:

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 * 8 = 24 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils they have is 24 + 46 = 70.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all their pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

Number of boxes = Total number of pencils / Number of pencils per box
= 70 / 8
= 8.75

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the cream. 

First, let's find the weakening effect of the ice cubes. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker, we can find the weakening effect per degree by dividing the weakening effect by the cooling effect: 12 milliliters / 13 degrees = 0.923 milliliters per degree.

Now, we can find the total weakening effect of the ice cubes by multiplying the weakening effect per degree by the total cooling effect: 0.923 milliliters/degree * 65 degrees = 60 milliliters.

Next, we need to find the total weakening effect of the cream. Since the cream is added to the coffee, it will weaken the coffee by its volume, which is 15 milliliters.

Now, we can find the total weakening effect by adding the weakening effect of the ice cubes and the cream: 60 milliliters + 15 milliliters = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of old records that the 5 people brought in. 

Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1. 

The 5 people left with 7 new records, so the total number of new records is 7. 

Since the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1, the total number of old records is 2 times the number of new records. 

Total old records = 2 * 7 = 14

However, this is the total number of old records traded by all 5 people. To find the number of old records each person brought in, we need to divide the total number of old records by 5.

Number of old records per person = 14 / 5 = 2.8

However, since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. 

Number of old records per person = 2.8 ≈ 2.8 is not a whole number, but since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we need to round down to 2. However, if we round down to 2, then the total number of old records traded would be 5 * 2 = 10, which is less than the 14 old records we calculated earlier. 

However, if we round up to 3, then the total number of old records traded would be 5 * 3 = 15, which is more than the 14 old records we calculated earlier. 

Since 2 * 5 = 10 and 3 * 5 = 15, the only way to get 14 old records is if 4 people brought in 2 records each and 1 person brought in 6 records. 

4 people brought in 2 records each = 4 * 2 = 8 records
1 person brought in 6 records = 6 records
Total old records = 8 + 6 = 14

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to find the number of junior programmers, the number of senior programmers, and then calculate the total amount paid to each group.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. 
Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * 100 = 40

Since the number of junior programmers is 40, the number of senior programmers is the remaining employees, which is 100 - 40 = 60.

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so the salary of a senior programmer is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

The total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmer
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

The total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmer
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $208000

The final answer is: $208000"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'. 

Initially, there were x people on the bus. 

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people became x + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the number of people became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.

Then, 8 more people got in, so the total number of people became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation:

x + 6 = 20

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

x = 20 - 6
x = 14

"To find out how many lollipops Oscar has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
2. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
3. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
4. He eats 3 more lollipops that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
5. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first find the total number of percentage points it needs to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs to charge 100% - 60% = 40% more.

Since the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can find the time it takes to charge 40% by multiplying the rate by the amount it needs to charge:

40% / 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes = 40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards they earned from their last shopping trip, apply the rewards and the coupon to their current shopping trip, and then subtract the total from the amount they spent.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip, so they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

On their current shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. Since they had 4 rewards, they used $4 off their purchase. 

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8. 

So, the total discount they got is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

To find out how much they paid, we subtract the total discount from the amount they spent: $43 - $12 = $31.

"To find the net pay for each job, we need to calculate the total income, subtract the property tax, and then subtract the income tax.

For Job A:
- Total income: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year
- Property tax: $0 (since it's not mentioned)
- Income tax: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B:
- Total income: $42,000/year
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income before tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Income tax: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
- Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net incomes of the two jobs:
Job A: $24,000
Job B: $32,400

Since $32,400 is greater than $24,000, Job B has the higher net pay rate.

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

"Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the last group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

2x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Since the last group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the last group by subtracting 10 from x:

x - 10 = 70 - 10

"Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as Ch. We know that Ch = 2C, since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows. We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so C + Ch = 60.

Substituting Ch = 2C into the equation, we get C + 2C = 60, which simplifies to 3C = 60. Dividing both sides by 3, we get C = 20.

Now that we know C = 20, we can find Ch by substituting C into the equation Ch = 2C, which gives us Ch = 2(20) = 40.

The number of legs on a cow is 4, and the number of legs on a chicken is 2. So, the total number of legs on the cows is 4C = 4(20) = 80, and the total number of legs on the chickens is 2Ch = 2(40) = 80.

The difference in the amount they make per day now and the amount they used to make per day is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100:

($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now. 

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total cost per month, we need to add the cost of food, treats, and medicine. 

First, let's find the cost of food per month. Since there are 4 weeks in a month and food costs $25 per week, the cost of food per month is:
$25/week * 4 weeks/month = $100/month

Now, let's add the cost of food, treats, and medicine to find the total cost per month:
$100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost per year is:
$220/month * 12 months/year = $2640/year

The final answer is: $2640"
"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time for each activity and add them up.

- Monday's yoga class: 1 hour
- Tuesday's cooking class: 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours
- Wednesday's cheese-tasting event: 0.5 hours (half of 1 hour)
- Thursday's museum tour: half as long as the cooking class, so 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours
- Friday's errands: 2 hours

Now, let's add up the time for all activities:
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots she needs and subtract that from the number she already bought.

The school needs 30 plant pots for the daisies. They need twice as many for the roses, which is 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots. 

So, the total number of plant pots needed is 30 + 60 = 90.

April already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Andrea started with $36.
2. She spent $11 on a sweater, so she had $36 - $11 = $25 left.
3. She then gave her brother $4, so she had $25 - $4 = $21 left.

Since $21 is the amount of money Andrea had after spending and giving her brother money, this is the amount she had after saving. To find the amount she saved, we need to subtract this from the initial amount.

Initial amount = $36
Amount after saving = $21

Amount saved = Initial amount - Amount after saving
Amount saved = $36 - $21
Amount saved = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total time John spent, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then find the total time. 

Time spent boating: 6 hours
Time spent swimming: 6 / 2 = 3 hours
Time spent watching shows: 3 * 2 = 6 hours
Total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours

Since the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time, we can set up the equation: 
0.3x = 6
x = 6 / 0.3
x = 20 hours

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time:
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 20
Time spent sightseeing = 8 hours

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has in her savings.

From her first job, she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours of work:
$10/hour * 20 hours = $200

From her second job, she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours of work:
$5/hour * 15 hours = $75

Total earnings from both jobs: $200 + $75 = $275

Annabelle already has $80 in her savings. To find out how much more she needs, we subtract her total earnings from her savings:
$80 - $275 = -$195

However, since we can't have a negative amount of money, this means Annabelle still needs to save more to reach her goal. To find out how much more she needs, we need to subtract her total earnings from the cost of the phone:
$400 - $275 = $125

So, Annabelle still needs to save $125 to buy the phone.

The final answer is: $125"
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.
2. The second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so its height is 6 + 5 = 11 feet.
3. The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. To find the combined height of the two shorter trees, we add their heights: 6 + 11 = 17 feet.
4. Now, we multiply the combined height by 2 to find the height of the tallest tree: 17 * 2 = 34 feet.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money he spent and then subtract that from the initial amount he received plus the extra $10.

First, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on toy cars and teddy bears:
6 toy cars * $2 = $12
5 teddy bears * $1 = $5
Total spent = $12 + $5 = $17

Now, let's add the initial amount Dean received and the extra $10:
$28 (initial amount) + $10 (extra) = $38

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the total amount Dean has:
$38 (total amount) - $17 (total spent) = $21

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is $5 per person. Since she will be playing too, we need to consider her as well. Let's assume the number of friends she invites is x. The total cost for mini-golf will be 1 (Morgan) + x (friends) * $5.

The cost of arcade tokens is $5.

The cost of go-karts is $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice. So, the total cost for go-karts will be 2 * $10 = $20.

The total budget is $90. We can set up the equation as follows:

1 (Morgan) + x (friends) * $5 + $5 (arcade tokens) + $20 (go-karts) = $90

Combine like terms:
1 + 5x + 5 + 20 = 90

Combine constants:
26 + 5x = 90

Subtract 26 from both sides:
5x = 64

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 12.8

Since you can't invite a fraction of a friend, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can invite 12 friends and still have some money left over."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to first find out how much money she spends on lollipops each day and then subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Marisa buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total amount she spends on lollipops each day is:
4 lollipops * 25 cents/lollipop = 100 cents or $1

Since Marisa gets $5 as pocket money each day, the amount she saves each day is:
$5 - $1 = $4

Now, we need to find out how much she saves in 5 days:
$4/day * 5 days = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Billy starts with $10.
2. He buys candy for $1.5 per pound. Let's call the number of pounds of candy he buys 'x'. The total cost of the candy is 1.5x.
3. After buying the candy, Billy has 10 - 1.5x dollars left.
4. He takes half of his change and spends it on gumballs. Half of his change is (10 - 1.5x)/2.
5. He buys 40 gumballs for $0.05 each. The total cost of the gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.
6. The amount he spent on gumballs is equal to half of his change: (10 - 1.5x)/2 = 2.
7. Now we can solve for x: (10 - 1.5x)/2 = 2
   Multiply both sides by 2: 10 - 1.5x = 4
   Subtract 10 from both sides: -1.5x = -6
   Divide both sides by -1.5: x = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. 

We are given that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45. 

We are also given that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, so we can write the equation: C = 2S - 5.

Substituting C = 45 into the equation, we get: 45 = 2S - 5.

To solve for S, we add 5 to both sides of the equation: 45 + 5 = 2S - 5 + 5, which simplifies to 50 = 2S.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for S: 50 / 2 = 2S / 2, which simplifies to 25 = S.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the three cities. 

Distance from the first city to the second city = 75 miles
Distance from the second city to the third city = 100 miles
Distance from the third city to the first city = 100 - 50 = 50 miles

Total distance in one trip = 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is:
Total distance in a day = 225 miles * 3 = 675 miles

To find the number of days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total distance it travels in a day (675 miles).

Number of days between services = 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days

Since the train cannot travel a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of days it goes between services, so we will round up to the nearest whole number to ensure it has enough time to complete the trip before needing service.

Therefore, the train goes 27 days between services."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds, we need to find the average of the stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds. 

The average of two numbers is found by adding the two numbers and dividing by 2. 

For the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds, the average is (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for the 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 

For the chihuahua beds, 4 beds * 2 pounds per bed = 8 pounds. 

For the collie beds, 3 beds * 5 pounds per bed = 15 pounds.

The total amount of stuffing needed is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"To find the total distance John drove, we need to add the original distance to his friend's house and the detour distance. 

Distance to friend's house = 200 miles
Detour distance = 10 miles
Total distance to friend's house = 200 + 10 = 210 miles

Time taken to drive to friend's house = Distance / Speed
Time taken to drive to friend's house = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

Distance home = 240 miles
Speed home = 80 mph
Time taken to drive home = Distance / Speed
Time taken to drive home = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to drive to friend's house + Time taken to drive home
Total time taken for the trip = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we first need to find the total number of students who were present on Friday. 

Total number of students = 96
Number of girls = 43
Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls
Number of boys = 96 - 43 = 53

Now, we know that 4 fourth-grade boys were absent on Friday. To find the number of boys who were present, we subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

Number of boys present = Number of boys - Number of absent boys
Number of boys present = 53 - 4

"Let's break down the information given:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S. 
   We can write the equation: S = 4 * 3 - 5
   S = 12 - 5
   S = 7
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V. 
   We can write the equation: V = 3 * S
   V = 3 * 7
   V = 21
4. If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, we can write the equation: 
   Total = 3 (refused to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) + X (other reasons)
   50 = 3 + 7 + 21 + X
   50 = 31 + X
   X = 50 - 31
   X = 19

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Erin now has 14 points. Sara scored 8 points. Erin has three times more points than Sara. 

Let's represent Sara's points as S and Erin's points as E. We know that E = 3S. We also know that E = 14. 

Since E = 3S and E = 14, we can set up the equation 3S = 14. 

To solve for S, we divide both sides of the equation by 3. 

S = 14 / 3
S = 4.67

Now that we know Sara's points, we can find Erin's points before. We know that Erin now has 14 points. To find Erin's points before, we need to subtract the points Sara scored from Erin's current points. 

However, we are not given the points Erin had before. We are given that Erin has three times more points than Sara. So, we need to find out how many points Sara scored when Erin had the same number of points as Sara. 

Let's call the points Erin had before x. We know that x + 8 = 3S. We already know that S = 4.67. 

x + 8 = 3 * 4.67
x + 8 = 14
x = 6

"To find the total cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the materials cost first. 

The original price of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

Since making it DIY saves 20%, we can calculate the materials cost as follows:

Materials cost = Original price - (Original price * 20%)
Materials cost = $400 - (400 * 0.20)
Materials cost = $400 - $80
Materials cost = $320

So, the total cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold on each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday.

Total shoes sold on Sunday = 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day:

Total shoes sold = 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold:

Total shoes sold = 50 * 2 = 100.

1. On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples picked and got $56. Since she sells apples at $4 per piece, we can find the number of apples she picked on Monday by dividing the total amount she got by the price per apple:
   Number of apples on Monday = Total amount / Price per apple
   Number of apples on Monday = $56 / $4
   Number of apples on Monday = 14

2. On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

3. On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day (Tuesday). 
   Number of apples on Wednesday = 2 * Number of apples on Tuesday
   Number of apples on Wednesday = 2 * 12

"To find the total profit per hour, we need to first find the total profit and then divide it by the number of hours she spends running the stand.

First, let's find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she bought enough supplies to make 3 pitchers, she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is 36 * $1 = $36.

The cost of the supplies is $18. So, the total profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and each cup is sold for $1, the revenue per hour is 4 * $1 = $4.

The profit per hour is the total profit divided by the number of hours, which is $18 / 36 (since she sells all the lemonade in 36/4 = 9 hours). 

$18 / 36 = $0.5

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu.

First, let's find the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and the number of messages to Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

The final answer is: 88"
"To find out how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of the rides for Dasha and compare it to the cost of the ride bracelet for David.

Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * $2 = $4.

Dasha buys tickets for 9 rides, so the total cost for her is 9 * $4 = $36.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.

The total cost for Dasha is $36, and the total cost for David is $30. 

The difference in cost is $36 - $30 = $6.

David saves $6 by buying a ride bracelet instead of tickets."
"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts. 

First, let's find the total number of gifts: 
6 (family) + 4 (friends) + 2 (teachers) = 12 gifts

Now, let's divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts:
144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

"To find the number of popsicles each person has, we need to divide the total number of popsicles by the sum of the ratio parts (5 + 6 = 11) and then multiply by the respective ratio parts.

Let's calculate the number of popsicles Betty has: 
(5/11) * 165 = 75

Now, let's calculate the number of popsicles Sam has:
(6/11) * 165 = 90

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
90 - 75 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. 

The normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $20. 

Since Tim saves 20% by bundling, we need to find 20% of $20. 
20% of $20 = 0.2 * $20 = $4

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

To find the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package.
$60 (cable package) - $26 (streaming services) = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total time spent, we need to convert all the time to the same unit. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. 

The time spent recording is half of 4 hours, which is 2 hours or 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. 

The total time spent is 240 minutes (writing) + 120 minutes (recording) + 90 minutes (editing) = 450 minutes.

The time spent editing is 90 minutes. 

To find the percentage, we divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100: (90 / 450) * 100 = 20%.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of books Wendy wants to place, we first need to find double the number of books in the shelving system. 

The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of books is 6 * 6 = 36.

Double the number of books is 2 * 36 = 72.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, so she needs 72 + 20 = 92 books.

The final answer is: 92"
"To find out how many Valentine's cards Erica has now, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards her dad brought, and then subtract the cards she passed out and add the cards she received.

Initially, Erica made 20 Valentine's cards.

Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each, so she received 2 * 15 = 30 cards.

She initially had 20 cards and received 30 more, so she had 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

She had 50 cards and gave away 29, so she had 50 - 29 = 21 cards left.

She received 17 cards from family and friends, so she now has 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find out how many slices are left, we need to first calculate how many slices Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill, which is (1/3) * 12 = 4 slices. 
Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark, which is (1/4) * 12 = 3 slices.

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so the total slices given away or eaten is 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

The number of slices left is 12 - 9 = 3 slices.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many days Mark has to save his money, we need to divide the cost of the bike by the amount he earns per day.

"To find the total number of bugs, we need to find the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Number of spiders = 90
Number of millipedes = 1/3 * 90 = 30

Number of stink bugs = 2 * number of millipedes - 12
= 2 * 30 - 12
= 60 - 12

"To find the total calories consumed by John, we need to calculate the total ounces of milk he drank and then multiply it by the calories per ounce.

John drank 2 glasses of milk, and each glass is 8 ounces. So, the total ounces of milk he drank is:
2 glasses * 8 ounces/glass = 16 ounces

Since milk has 3 calories per ounce, the total calories consumed by John is:
16 ounces * 3 calories/ounce = 48 calories

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total amount the builder earns in a year, we need to calculate the total number of days he works in a year and then multiply it by his daily wage.

The builder works 4 weeks every month, and there are 52 weeks in a year. However, since he works 6 days a week, we need to calculate the total number of days he works in a year.

Total days worked in a year = 52 weeks/year * 6 days/week = 312 days/year

Now, we multiply the total number of days worked in a year by his daily wage to find the total amount he earns in a year.

Total amount earned in a year = 312 days/year * $50/day = $15600

The final answer is: $15600"
"To find out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, he needs 4 times the amount of each ingredient.

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs to buy:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs to buy:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to find the original energy used per day and then subtract the new energy used per day.

Original energy used per day = 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (or 7.2 kilowatt-hours, since 1 kilowatt-hour = 1000 watts * 1 hour)

New energy used per day = 900 watts * (8 - 5) hours = 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours (or 2.7 kilowatt-hours)

Energy saved per day = Original energy used per day - New energy used per day = 7.2 kilowatt-hours - 2.7 kilowatt-hours = 4.5 kilowatt-hours

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, multiply the energy saved per day by 30:

Total energy saved in 30 days = 4.5 kilowatt-hours/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatt-hours

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the average number of stripes, we need to find the total number of stripes and divide it by the total number of zebras.

There are 2 zebras with 17 stripes each, so they have a total of 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.
There is 1 zebra with 36 stripes.
There is 1 zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

The total number of stripes is 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.
The total number of zebras is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

The average number of stripes is the total number of stripes divided by the total number of zebras, which is 88 / 4 = 22.

"To find out how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves. 

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, Tyson will need 5 pounds of each.

The cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
The cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Allan initially has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

2. Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store. So, the total number of cannolis now is 40 + 60 = 100.

3. He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he bought 60 cannolis, he bought 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

4. Now, Allan has 80 (initial corns) + 20 (new corns) = 100 corns.

5. The total number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 (cannolis) + 100 (corns) = 200.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Elliott wants to walk 10,000 steps a day.
- He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Half of 10,000 is 5,000 steps.
- He also took 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
- After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take.

So, the total steps Elliott took before his jog is 5,000 (to and from school) + 1,000 (with his friend) = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, the total steps he took before and after his jog is 6,000 + 2,000 = 8,000 steps.

To find the steps he took during his jog, we subtract the steps he took before his jog from the total steps he needed to take: 10,000 - 8,000 = 2,000 steps.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To find out how many minutes it will take Toby to read the book, we need to multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page and then divide by the reading rate.

Number of words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words
Time to read the book = 9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Since it takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, Toby will arrive 30 minutes (time to read the book) + 10 minutes (time to get to the airport) = 40 minutes after his planned departure time.

However, Toby has 60 minutes before he has to leave for the airport. So, he will be 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes early.

"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees left is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and subtract that from the initial $10.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds and the sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off,"" we can consider it as a 2-pound purchase with a discount on the second pound. The first pound costs $3, and the second pound is 1/2 off, so it costs $3 * 0.5 = $1.5. The total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.5 = $4.5.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. She bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.5 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally initially had $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework.

The first package of fireworks costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

He gets a 20% discount on the fireworks. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.20: $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discount amount is subtracted from the total cost: $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150.

The total amount spent is the sum of the discounted fireworks and the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate how many cookies she will eat in 30 days and then divide that number by the number of cookies her recipe makes.

Shannon eats 2 cookies per night. To find out how many cookies she will eat in 30 days, we multiply 2 cookies per night by 30 nights:

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since Shannon's recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she will eat by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs:

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two events.

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50,000 candles smell like wet dog, so the number of candles that smell like wet dog is 0.05 * 50,000 = 2500.

Next, we need to find the number of candles that are guaranteed not to explode. 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, so the number of candles that are guaranteed not to explode is 0.99 * 50,000 = 49,500.

However, the candles that smell like wet dog are a subset of the total candles, and the 99% guarantee only applies to the total candles, not the subset of candles that smell like wet dog. To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the number of candles that smell like wet dog and are not guaranteed not to explode.

The number of candles that are not guaranteed not to explode is 1% of 50,000, which is 0.01 * 50,000 = 500. 

Since 5% of the candles smell like wet dog, and 1% of the candles are not guaranteed not to explode, we can assume that the 5% and 1% are independent events. Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and are not guaranteed not to explode is 0.05 * 0.01 * 50,000 = 25.

However, this is the number of candles that smell like wet dog and are not guaranteed not to explode. To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to subtract this number from the total number of candles that smell like wet dog. 

The number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 2500 - 25 = 2475.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount is 30% of the regular price of $20. To find the discount amount, we multiply the regular price by the discount percentage (as a decimal): 
$20 * 0.30 = $6

Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to find the discounted price of each blouse:
$20 - $6 = $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, we multiply the discounted price by 4 to find the total cost:
$14 * 4 = $56

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The average trees are not specified, so let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as 'x'.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 45 + x.
The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can write the equation: (45 + x) + 105 = 500.

Simplifying the equation, we get 150 + x = 500.

Subtracting 150 from both sides, we get x = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We are given two equations based on the information:

1. The total number of heads is 180, so C + D = 180.
2. The total number of bumps is 304, and since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump, we can write the equation as 2C + D = 304.

We can solve this system of linear equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation to eliminate D:

2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute C into the first equation to find D:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

So, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the problem into parts.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days:
Distance = 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled over the next two days, which is 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days:
Distance = 30% * 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

Now, let's add the distance traveled on the next day, which is 0 km (he wasn't traveling).

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled during the second week:
Distance = 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Finally, let's add up all the distances to find the total distance traveled by Tom:
Total Distance = 800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The final answer is: 3140"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. This means Zack's locker is 4 times as big as Peter's locker.
3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. This means Timothy's locker is twice as big as Zack's locker.

Now, let's find the size of Zack's locker:
Since Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it's 1/4 of Zack's locker, we can find Zack's locker size by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4:
Zack's locker size = 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches

Now, let's find the size of Timothy's locker:
Since Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches and it's half of Timothy's locker, we can find Timothy's locker size by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2:
Timothy's locker size = 20 * 2 = 40 cubic inches

"To find the distance Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to find the difference between Stanley's elevation and Oliver's elevation. 

Stanley's elevation is 10,000 feet, and Oliver's elevation is 3,000 feet. 

The difference between the two elevations is 10,000 - 3,000 = 7,000 feet.

However, we also need to consider the 4,000 feet that the comb fell. Since Oliver is at a lower elevation than Stanley, he needs to climb up to the point where the comb was initially dropped, not where it landed. 

So, Oliver needs to climb 4,000 feet to reach the point where the comb was initially dropped, and then another 3,000 feet to reach Stanley's elevation. 

The total distance Oliver must climb is 4,000 + 3,000 = 7,000 feet.

"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the steps:

1. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats carried away is 4 * 5 = 20.
3. The remaining cats on the rock are 50 - 20 = 30.
4. 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran, we multiply 3/5 by 30: (3/5) * 30 = 18.
5. The number of cats left on the rock is the remaining cats minus the cats that ran after the mouse: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different periods and calculate the cost for each period.

1. The first 6 months cost $8 per month, so the total cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.
2. The next 8 months cost $12 per month, so the total cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.
3. The remaining months in 2 years (24 months) - the first 6 months and the next 8 months = 24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months. The cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, we add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. 
   Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J. 
   We can write the equation: J = T - 6.

2. The total savings is $6. 
   Since Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 2/3 from the tattered jeans. 
   We can write the equation: (1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6.

3. Substitute J from the first equation into the second equation: 
   (1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6.

4. Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 
   T - 6 + 2T = 18.

5. Combine like terms: 
   3T - 6 = 18.

6. Add 6 to both sides: 
   3T = 24.

7. Divide both sides by 3: 
   T = 8.

8. Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans, we can find the cost of the jogger jeans: 
   J = T - 6 = 8 - 6 = 2.

9. The question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans: 
   J - T = 2 - 8 = -6.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, so she has a total of 3 + 3 = 6 bird feeders.

Each bird feeder attracts 20 birds, but the ones she made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. Let's assume the store-bought ones attract 20 birds. Then, the ones she made herself will attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds.

Since there are 3 store-bought bird feeders and 3 self-made bird feeders, the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought ones is 3 * 20 = 60 birds, and the total number of birds attracted by the self-made ones is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is the sum of the birds attracted by the store-bought and self-made bird feeders: 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.25: $4 * 0.25 = $1. Then, we add this to the cost of the bagel: $4 + $1 = $5. So, the soup costs $5.

The cake costs half the price of the bagel. To find half of $4, we divide $4 by 2: $4 / 2 = $2. So, the cake costs $2.

Now, we add the costs of the bagel, soup, and cake together: $4 + $5 + $2 = $11.

The final answer is: $11"
"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how many cards he sold. Since he has $50 in spending cash and the ticket costs $100, he must have made $50 from selling the cards.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as 'x'. Since he keeps 1/3 of the cards, he sells 2/3 of the cards. The selling price of each card is $1.5, so the total amount he made from selling the cards is (2/3)x * $1.5.

We know that the total amount he made from selling the cards is $50. So, we can set up the equation:

(2/3)x * $1.5 = $50

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2 to get:

x * $1.5 = $50 * (3/2)
x * $1.5 = $75

Now, we can divide both sides by $1.5 to get:

x = $75 / $1.5
x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many guests were expected to have two hotdogs. Since half of the 36 guests were expected to have two hotdogs, we can calculate this as follows:

36 / 2 = 18

So, 18 guests were expected to have two hotdogs. This means that the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs for these 18 guests.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that the caterer had to provide a second hotdog to the 18 guests who were already expected to have two hotdogs, and also to the additional 22 guests (40 - 18 = 22) who were not expected to have two hotdogs.

Since the caterer had already prepared 36 hotdogs for the 18 guests who were expected to have two hotdogs, he had to prepare 22 more hotdogs for the additional 22 guests. This means that the total number of hotdogs prepared is 36 + 22 = 58.

Since the caterer had prepared 58 hotdogs, and there were 40 guests, we can find out how many hotdogs each guest got by dividing the total number of hotdogs by the number of guests:

58 / 40 = 1.45

Since we can't have a fraction of a hotdog, we can round down to 1 hotdog per guest for 40 guests, and then we have 18 hotdogs left over. These 18 hotdogs were for the 18 guests who were expected to have two hotdogs.

So, the 18 guests who were expected to have two hotdogs got their second hotdog, but the remaining guests did not get a second hotdog. Since there were 40 guests in total, and 18 of them got a second hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

40 - 18 = 22

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we need to first find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3.

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 6 + 7 = 13.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to find out how much gas was in one container. 

15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, so each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we can convert 3 gallons to pints by multiplying 3 by 8. 

3 * 8 = 24 pints

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so we need to find 1/4 of 3 gallons. 

1/4 * 3 = 0.75 gallons

Now, we convert 0.75 gallons to pints by multiplying 0.75 by 8.

0.75 * 8 = 6 pints

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, which means he spent 99% of his money. 
   So, the amount he spent is 99% of $5, which is 0.99 * 5 = $4.95.

2. Since he bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, the total cost of chips is 3 * 0.40 = $1.20.

3. The remaining amount he spent on candy bars is $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75.

4. Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, the number of candy bars he bought is $3.75 / 0.75 = 5.

"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to subtract the lollipops he kept from the total and then divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.

Ray had 25 lollipops initially. He kept 5, so the number of lollipops he shared is 25 - 5 = 20.

He shared these 20 lollipops equally among 4 friends. To find out how many each friend received, we divide 20 by 4:

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we first need to find the weight of one piece of cake. 

The total weight of the cake is 20 ounces, and it is cut into 8 pieces. 

Weight of one piece = Total weight / Number of pieces
Weight of one piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of one piece = 2.5 ounces

Since Rory and her mom each have a piece, they have 2 pieces in total. 

Weight of the remaining cake = Total weight - Weight of the pieces eaten
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 ounces - (2 * 2.5 ounces)
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Weight of the remaining cake = 15 ounces

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The drive from Wayne's hotel to the theater takes 4 minutes.
2. The drive from Bernadette's apartment to the theater takes 4 times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, so it takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.
3. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne arrives at the theater.
4. Since Wayne arrives at the theater in 4 minutes, Bernadette needs to leave 4 + 5 = 9 minutes before Wayne arrives at the theater.
5. However, Bernadette's drive is 16 minutes long, so she needs to leave 9 minutes before Wayne arrives at the theater, which is 16 - 9 = 7 minutes before Wayne leaves his hotel.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 7 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. 

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length in feet is 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length * width = area. We can rearrange this formula to find the width: width = area / length. 

Substituting the values we know, we get width = 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula: perimeter = 2 * (length + width). 

Substituting the values we know, we get perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 feet.

"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads they bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Difference in the number of beads = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has

"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour for 3 hours, so the total temperature increase is 5 * 3 = 15 degrees.

The window cools down the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes, and it is open for 30 minutes. To find the total temperature decrease, we need to convert 30 minutes to hours (0.5 hours) and then divide by 10 minutes to find the number of intervals of 10 minutes. 0.5 hours / 0.1 hours per interval = 5 intervals. The total temperature decrease is 2 * 5 = 10 degrees.

The initial temperature is 40 degrees. The temperature increase is 15 degrees, and the temperature decrease is 10 degrees. The final temperature is 40 + 15 - 10 = 45 degrees.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took James to complete each part of the triathlon. 

The time it took Jon to complete the swim is 40 minutes. James finishes the swim 10% faster, so we need to find 10% of 40 and subtract it from 40. 

10% of 40 is 0.1 * 40 = 4. 
So, James finishes the swim in 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

The time it took Jon to complete the bike ride is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. James takes 5 minutes longer, so he takes 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. This means that the total time it took James to complete the triathlon is 10 minutes more than the total time it took Jon. 

The total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes. 
So, the total time it took James to complete the triathlon is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

We know that James took 36 minutes to swim and 85 minutes to bike. To find out how long it took him to run, we need to subtract these times from the total time it took him to complete the triathlon.

The time it took James to run is 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

"To find the total amount of hay the horse eats, we need to find the distance it runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, we need to convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32MPH * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat:
16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails of hay

Each bail costs $3, so the total cost of hay is:
8 bails * $3/bail = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:
6 * $5 = $30

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money:

17 * $20 = $340

Next, let's find the revenue from the sale to the department store:
The salesman had 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.
These were sold for $25 each, so the revenue from the department store sale is:
31 * $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store sale:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The initial cost of the case of sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue:

2. The regular price of a soda is $3.
3. If you buy a regular ticket and a soda and popcorn, you save $2 compared to buying the super ticket.

Since you save $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of the regular ticket and the soda and popcorn must be $20 - $2 = $18.

The cost of the regular ticket is $12, so the cost of the soda and popcorn together is $18 - $12 = $6.

Since the soda costs $3, the cost of the popcorn is $6 - $3 = $3.

The regular price of popcorn is $3."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, the cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. To find the cost per balloon, we divide the total cost by the number of balloons:

= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = 15 (red cards) + 24 (green cards)

Now, let's find the total cost of the apples for Kelly: 
20 apples * 50 cents/apple = 20 * 0.5 = $10

Then, calculate the 10% discount: 
10% of $10 = 0.1 * $10 = $1

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost: 
$10 - $1 = $9

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to subtract Becky's cost from Kelly's cost: 
$9 - $8 = $1

"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank has on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has after gaining new pairs and then subtract the shoes he gets rid of on Saturday.

Initially, Fireman Frank has 200 shoes.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, he gets 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.

On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.

On Friday, he gains 30 new pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

So, the total number of shoes he has after gaining new pairs is 200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.

Therefore, the total number of shoes he has on Sunday is 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

"To find the total number of pencils used, we first need to find the total number of pencils initially in the class. 

There are 30 students, and each student started with 10 pencils. So, the total number of pencils initially is 30 * 10 = 300.

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. 1/5 of 300 is (1/5) * 300 = 60. So, 60 pencils were used.

The remaining pencils after two months are 300 - 60 = 240.

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. 1/3 of 240 is (1/3) * 240 = 80.

The number of pencils left at the end of the year is 80."
"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

Number of cookies = (1/2)x + 2

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit. Since the remoras are given in inches, we'll convert the shark's length to inches.

1 foot = 12 inches
10 feet = 10 * 12 = 120 inches

The length of the remoras is 2 * 6 = 12 inches.

Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy:

(Length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100
= (12 / 120) * 100
= 0.1 * 100
= 10%

"To find out how many days Jason has to walk in total, we need to multiply the number of weeks by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week) and then multiply that by the number of days he walks per week.

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days
21 days * 4 days/week = 84 days

Now, we need to find out how many minutes Jason has to walk each day to break in the shoes in 84 days. 

Total minutes to break in the shoes = 240 minutes
Total days to break in the shoes = 84 days

Minutes per day = Total minutes to break in the shoes / Total days to break in the shoes
Minutes per day = 240 minutes / 84 days
Minutes per day = 2.857 (approximately)

"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first find out how many books Sarah bought in total. 

We know that Sarah spent $300 on the books and each book costs $15. 

To find the total number of books, we divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book: 

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we need to divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child got:

Number of books per child = Total number of books / Number of children
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to find the total number of kids allergic to at least one thing and subtract that from the total number of kids in the class.

First, let's find the total number of kids allergic to at least one thing. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to do this.

Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts = (Number of kids allergic to dairy) + (Number of kids allergic to peanuts) - (Number of kids allergic to both)
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

However, this counts the kids allergic to both twice, so we need to subtract them once to avoid double-counting.

Number of kids allergic to at least one thing = 12

Now, we can find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything by subtracting the number of kids allergic to at least one thing from the total number of kids in the class.

Number of kids not allergic to anything = Total number of kids - Number of kids allergic to at least one thing
= 32 - 12

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal, so the new price is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

"To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon.

Since the razors are buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Heather also has a $2.00 coupon, so she will get a discount of $2.00.

The total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to divide the total cost by the number of razors: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Angela's current age be x.

In four years, Angela's age will be x + 4.

According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is 14 years old now, in four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

So, we can set up the equation: x + 4 = 3(14)

To solve for x, we need to distribute the 3 to 14: x + 4 = 42

Now, we need to isolate x by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation: x = 42 - 4

x = 38

"Let's denote the number of insects found by Bodhi as B, David as D, and Lily as L.

We know that together they collected 43 insects, so L + D + B = 43.

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, so L = D + 7.

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so D = B/2.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation: (D + 7) + D + B = 43.

Combine like terms: 2D + 7 + B = 43.

Now substitute D = B/2 into the equation: 2(B/2) + 7 + B = 43.

Simplify the equation: B + 7 + B = 43.

Combine like terms: 2B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2B = 36.

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18.

Now that we know B, we can find D: D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9.

Now that we know D, we can find L: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.
- 2 packs are strawberry gum.
- 1 pack is grape gum, which costs $2.
- 1 pack is green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum, so it costs $2 / 2 = $1.
- The total cost is $7.

We know that the total cost is the sum of the costs of all the packs of gum. Let's denote the cost of each strawberry pack as 'x'. Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, their total cost is 2x.

The total cost of the grape gum is $2, and the total cost of the green apple gum is $1. So, the total cost of all the gum is 2x + 2 + 1 = 7.

Now, we can solve for x:

2x = 4

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 2

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2."
"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar and then calculate how many of that type of wood he can buy with his budget.

First, let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

For a 2 x 4, Frederick gets 200 sticks for $4, so the cost per stick is $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick.
For a 2 x 8, Frederick gets 400 sticks for $6, so the cost per stick is $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick.

Since a 2 x 8 gives him more sticks per dollar, we will focus on buying 2 x 8 pieces of wood.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24 budget:
$24 / $6 = 4

Since he can buy 4 2 x 8 pieces of wood, he will get 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. Since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals

"Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'. 

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can write the equation as:
x + y = 4(x + y)

Given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, we can write the equation as:
x + y = 4(x + y)
12 + 4 = 4x + 4y

Simplifying the equation:
16 = 4x + 4y

Dividing both sides by 4:
4 = x + y

Since we know that x + y = 4, we can substitute this into the original equation:
x + y = 4

Now, we need to find the values of x and y. We know that Rose bought 12 onions, which is 4 times the number of onions Sophia bought. So, we can write:
12 = 4x
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find y:
x + y = 4
3 + y = 4
y = 1

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 3 + 1 = 4."

February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. 
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. 
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days. 
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days. 
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days. 
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total days = 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 171 days

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 lb, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories in total.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 
105,000 / 171 ≈ 613.5 calories per day.

The final answer is: 614"
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate his total earnings for the week and subtract the amount he spent.

Since Gerald works 7 days a week, his total earnings for the week would be:
$30/day * 7 days = $210

Now, let's subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:
$210 - $100 = $110

Gerald has $110 left."
"To find the total distance Hannah needs to run, we multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap. 

Distance = Number of laps * Distance per lap
Distance = 8 * 0.25 km
Distance = 2 km

Since Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water needed per kilometer.

Total water needed = Distance * Water per kilometer
Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km
Total water needed = 120 ml

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Julie started with $500.
2. She spent 20% of $500 on clothes. 
   20% of $500 = 0.2 * $500 = $100
   So, she spent $100 on clothes, leaving her with $500 - $100 = $400.
3. Then, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.
   25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100
   So, she spent $100 on CDs, leaving her with $400 - $100 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we can find the cost of the house by multiplying x by 3:

Cost of the house = 3x = 3(30,000) = 90,000

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the canvas bags, which is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack * $4 per bag = 8 * 5 * 4 = $160.

The total revenue is the selling price of the bags, which is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $64 - $160 = -$96.

However, since profit cannot be negative, it seems there is an error in the problem. The selling price of $8 per bag is less than the cost price of $4 per bag, which is not possible. 

Assuming the selling price is actually higher than the cost price, let's recalculate the profit with a higher selling price. 

Let's assume the selling price is $12 per bag. The total revenue would be 8 bags * $12 per bag = 8 * 12 = $96.

The profit would be the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $96 - $160 = -$64. However, this is still a negative profit.

Let's try a higher selling price. 

Let's assume the selling price is $16 per bag. The total revenue would be 8 bags * $16 per bag = 8 * 16 = $128.

The profit would be the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $128 - $160 = -$32. However, this is still a negative profit.

Let's try a higher selling price.

Let's assume the selling price is $20 per bag. The total revenue would be 8 bags * $20 per bag = 8 * 20 = $160.

The profit would be the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $160 - $160 = $0.

However, this is not a profit. Let's try a higher selling price.

Let's assume the selling price is $24 per bag. The total revenue would be 8 bags * $24 per bag = 8 * 24 = $192.

The profit would be the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $192 - $160 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total time of the fight and multiply it by the average number of punches per minute.

The fight lasts for 5 rounds of 3 minutes each, so the total time is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, the total number of punches is 15 * 25 = 375.

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, we can find out how many cookies Kelsie made. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, so we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Ali has: 
   Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. 
   Total money from $10 bills = 4 * $10 = $40
   Total money from $20 bills = 6 * $20 = $120
   Total money = $40 + $120 = $160

2. Ali gives his sister half of the total money:
   Half of the total money = $160 / 2 = $80
   Money left after giving his sister half = $160 - $80 = $80

3. Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner:
   3/5 of the remaining money = (3/5) * $80 = $48
   Money left after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house. We need to convert this to minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.
2. Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. So, we need to find double the time it takes Rob: 2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes.
3. Now, we add 40 minutes to this result to find the time it takes Royce: 240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes.

For each grandchild, Martha needs:
- 2 skeins for a hat
- 4 skeins for a scarf
- 12 skeins for a sweater
- 1 skein for a pair of mittens
- 2 skeins for a pair of socks

Total skeins per grandchild = 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 19 skeins

Since there are 3 grandchildren, the total number of skeins needed is:
Total skeins = 19 skeins/grandchild * 3 grandchildren = 57 skeins

"To find out how many problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to calculate the total number of problems he completed and subtract that from the initial total of 100.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems.
On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.
So, in total, Chris completed 12 + 36 = 48 problems on Monday and Tuesday.

The remaining problems after Monday and Tuesday are 100 - 48 = 52.

On Wednesday, Chris completed one-quarter of the remaining problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

So, the total number of problems Chris completed by Wednesday is 48 + 13 = 61.

To find out how many problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we subtract the total problems completed from the initial total: 100 - 61 = 39.

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to find the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour and add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Now, we add the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29.

Loaves sold in the afternoon = 39
Loaves returned = 6

Total loaves sold = 93 + 39 = 132
Total loaves left = Total loaves baked - Total loaves sold - Loaves returned
Total loaves left = 200 - 132 - 6
Total loaves left = 62

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins by the amount of raisins needed for each batch of cookies.

First, let's find out how many cups of raisins will be used for the granola and snack mix. Since Heather divides the bag of raisins equally among the three items, each item will get 1/3 of the total raisins.

Total raisins = 27 cups
Raisins for each item = 27 / 3 = 9 cups

Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we need to find out how many cups of raisins are left for the oatmeal cookies after setting aside 9 cups for the other two items.

Raisins left for oatmeal cookies = 27 - 9 = 18 cups

Now, we can divide the raisins left for oatmeal cookies by the amount of raisins needed for each batch of cookies.

Number of batches of oatmeal cookies = 18 / (3/4) = 18 * (4/3) = 24

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device, then find the difference in the total cost.

Ada's daily consumption before adding the new device is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption is 12 * 24 = 288 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. Her daily consumption will be 14 * 24 = 336 kWh per day.

Ada's weekly consumption before adding the new device is 288 * 7 = 2016 kWh per week.

Ada's weekly consumption after adding the new device is 336 * 7 = 2352 kWh per week.

The cost of 1 kWh is $1.50. So, the weekly cost before adding the new device is 2016 * $1.50 = $3024.

The weekly cost after adding the new device is 2352 * $1.50 = $3528.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $3528 - $3024 = $504.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house. 

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then 5 people can paint half a house in 5/5 = 1 day. 

Since 5 people can paint half a house in 1 day, they can paint a whole house in 2 days (because 2 * 0.5 = 1).

Now, we need to convert the time from days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 2 days is equal to 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has x chairs, where x - 2 = 20 (sofas).
3. Solving for x, we get x = 22 (chairs).
4. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
5. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.
6. To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add Ophelia's and Jenna's sofas and chairs: 20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 64 (Jenna's sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 152.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say the cost of the headphone set is x.

We know that Tom paid a total of $48 for the CD and the headphone set. We also know that the CD costs $4.

So, the cost of the headphone set is the total cost minus the cost of the CD: x = 48 - 4
x = 44

Now, we want to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not bought the headphone set. This means we need to find out how many CDs he could have bought with the money he saved by not buying the headphone set.

The money he saved by not buying the headphone set is $44 (the cost of the headphone set). 

Since each CD costs $4, the number of CDs he could have bought with the saved money is: 44 / 4
= 11

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours spent in the weeks where he worked out 4 hours, the weeks where he worked out 5 hours, and the week where he worked out 6 hours.

Let's break it down:

- Weeks where he worked out 4 hours: 8 weeks - 2 weeks (where he worked out 5 hours) - 1 week (where he worked out 6 hours) = 5 weeks
- Total hours in these 5 weeks = 5 weeks * 4 hours/week = 20 hours
- Weeks where he worked out 5 hours: 2 weeks
- Total hours in these 2 weeks = 2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours
- Week where he worked out 6 hours: 1 week
- Total hours in this week = 1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, let's add up the total hours:
Total hours = 20 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 36 hours

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get in.
Now, the total number of people on the bus is:
40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 3 times fewer means 3 times the number of people who got off minus the number of people who got off, we need to find 3 times 21 and then subtract 21 from it.
3 * 21 = 63
63 - 21 = 42

Now, the total number of people on the bus is:
59 (left) + 42 (got in) = 101

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
2. The computer cost $1,100.
3. The printer cost $400 less than the computer.

First, let's find the cost of the printer. Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer:
Printer cost = Computer cost - $400
Printer cost = $1,100 - $400
Printer cost = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, printer, and 2 monitors is $2,400. We can subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total to find the cost of the 2 monitors:
Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - (Computer cost + Printer cost)
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - ($1,100 + $700)
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,800
Cost of 2 monitors = $600

Since we want to find the cost of one monitor, we divide the cost of 2 monitors by 2:
Cost of one monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. There are 20 kids in total, divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. So, the number of girls and boys is 20 / 2 = 10 each.

2. The boys brought back 60 shells each, so the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

3. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 60 shells.

4. To find the number of shells brought by the girls, we need to calculate 4 * 60 = 240.

5. Now, we add the number of shells brought by the boys to the number of shells brought by the girls: 600 + 240 = 840.

6. Since there are 10 girls, we need to divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by 10 to find the number of shells brought by each girl: 840 / 10 = 84.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let x be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of the month. 

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, he will save 2x each day in the second half.

The total number of days in April is 30. 

The total amount Elvis saves in the first half is 15x (15 days). 

The total amount Elvis saves in the second half is 15 * 2x = 30x.

The total amount Elvis saves in the month is 15x + 30x = 45x.

We know that Elvis wants to save a total of $1125. 

So, we can set up the equation: 45x = 1125.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 45: x = 1125 / 45 = 25.

Now that we know x, we can find the amount Elvis saves each day in the second half: 2x = 2 * 25 = 50.

1. Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. 
2. Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks.

Let's assume the daily recommended cups of coffee is x. Then, Octavia drinks x/2 cups of coffee.

Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups of coffee.

Now, Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we need to subtract the recommended amount from his current intake:

5x - 4

However, we don't know the value of x. But we can express the reduction in terms of x. To find the actual reduction, we need to know the value of x. But since we are asked to find the reduction in terms of the daily recommended cups, we can express the reduction as a fraction of the daily recommended cups.

The reduction is 5x - 4 cups, and the daily recommended cups is x. So, the reduction as a fraction of the daily recommended cups is (5x - 4)/x.

To simplify this expression, we can factor out x from the numerator:

(5x - 4)/x = (5x/x - 4/x)
= 5 - 4/x

However, we still don't know the value of x. But we can express the reduction in terms of the daily recommended cups. The reduction is 1 cup less than 5 times the daily recommended cups.

Now, we have the weights of all three friends: Mark (150 pounds), Susan (130 pounds), and Bob (260 pounds).

To find the average weight, we add their weights and divide by 3:

Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we need to find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which is 105 / 1.5 = 70.

Now that we know there are 70 intervals of 1.5 minutes, and she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we multiply 70 by 2 to find the total pages she read in the first week: 70 * 2 = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we add the pages she read in the first week to the pages she read in the second week: 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, the total for these teeth is 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, we add the amounts together: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Richie scored 80 goals.
2. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.
   So, Mark scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals.
3. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna.
   So, Anna scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals.

Now, let's add up the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:
Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we need to first find out how much money Mitchell made and then subtract the amount Liam made from it.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so we multiply the number of lemonades by the price per lemonade:
21 * 4 = 84

Now, we subtract the amount Liam made from the amount Mitchell made:
84 - 63 = 21

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of action figures he bought each day and add them up.

From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. He has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week, which is 7 days. 

First, let's find out how much he spent on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spent an equal amount each day, we can divide the total amount by 7 to find the daily amount: $70 / 7 = $10 per day.

Since he spent $10 per day on wooden action figures for 4 days (Sunday through Wednesday), the total amount spent on wooden action figures is $10 * 4 = $40.

The remaining amount of money he has is $70 - $40 = $30. Since he has $30 left and he wants to spend an equal amount each day for the rest of the week, we can divide the remaining amount by 4 (the number of days left in the week) to find the daily amount: $30 / 4 = $7.50 per day.

Since he spent $7.50 per day on plastic action figures for 4 days (Thursday through Saturday), the total amount spent on plastic action figures is $7.50 * 4 = $30.

Now, let's find the total number of wooden action figures he bought: $40 / $5 = 8 wooden action figures.

Now, let's find the total number of plastic action figures he bought: $30 / $2 = 15 plastic action figures.

The total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is 8 wooden action figures + 15 plastic action figures = 23 action figures.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total cost, we need to add up the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200.
The cost of the vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60.
The cost of the broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The final answer is: $308"
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to first calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 - 160 = 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the remaining amount in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount removed from the account and subtract it from the initial amount.

Since Katina removes $100 every month, and there are 12 months in a year, she removes a total of:

$100/month * 12 months/year = $1200/year

In 2 years, she will remove a total of:

$1200/year * 2 years = $2400

Now, subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount:

$3000 - $2400 = $600

"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. So, the cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30 per sandwich.

The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00. So, the cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00 per sandwich.

The total cost per sandwich is the sum of the cost of bread and cheese and condiments, which is $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30 per sandwich.

The revenue per sandwich is $7.00.

The net profit per sandwich is the revenue per sandwich minus the total cost per sandwich, which is $7.00 - $3.30 = $3.70 per sandwich.

Since they sell 10 sandwiches, the total revenue is $7.00 per sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $70.00.

The total cost is $3.30 per sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $33.00.

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to determine how many muffin crayons she can make and then multiply that number by the price of each muffin crayon.

Since Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons, she has a total of 3 * 64 = 192 crayons.

She melts 8 crayons together to make one muffin crayon, so the total number of muffin crayons she can make is 192 / 8 = 24.

Since each muffin crayon sells for $1.50, Kate can make 24 * $1.50 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom and the costs for the carpet, padding, removal, and installation.

The area of the bedroom is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost for the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost for the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost for removal is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost for installation is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost is the sum of the costs for the carpet, padding, removal, and installation: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11332.

The final answer is: $11332"
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and divide it by the number of days.

Total number of birds = 50 (days 1 and 2) + 0 (day 3) + 120 (days 4 and 5) + 20 (day 6) + 90 (day 7)
Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90
Total number of birds = 280

"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to find the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18.

The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Now, we need to find the temperature that Maggie should set the oven to in order to achieve 520 degrees. Let's call this temperature x.

Since the oven is off by 4%, we can set up the following equation:

x - (4% of x) = 520

To find 4% of x, we multiply x by 0.04:

x - 0.04x = 520

Combine like terms:

0.96x = 520

Divide both sides by 0.96:

x = 520 / 0.96
x = 541.67

So, Maggie should set the oven to 541.67 degrees to achieve 520 degrees."
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 1 hour to 60 minutes. Adding 30 minutes to that gives us 60 + 30 = 90 minutes for the first movie.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours to minutes gives us 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. Adding 5 minutes to that gives us 120 + 5 = 125 minutes for the second movie.

Now, we add the time for both movies together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

The final answer is: 215"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price.

Herb's house price = $76,000
30% of Herb's house price = 0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800
Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
= $76,000 - $22,800
= $53,200

Now, we need to find the combined value of the two houses.
Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
= $76,000 + $53,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.
2. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.
3. Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 + 20 = 60 dishes.
4. To find the total number of cups, we add Judy's cups and her friend's cups: 12 + 40 = 52 cups.
5. To find the total number of dishes, we add Judy's dishes and her friend's dishes: 24 + 60 = 84 dishes.
6. The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) is the sum of the total cups and total dishes: 52 + 84 = 136.

"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we need to first find the total number of pairs of contacts Pete will have, and then the total cost of the contacts.

Since 90 contacts last 45 days, the number of pairs of contacts per day is 90 / 45 = 2 pairs per day.

If Pete buys 2 boxes, he will have 2 * 90 = 180 contacts, which is 180 / 2 = 90 pairs of contacts.

The discount on each box is 10% of $100, which is 0.1 * $100 = $10. So, the discounted price of each box is $100 - $10 = $90.

The total cost of 2 boxes is 2 * $90 = $180.

The cost per pair of contacts is $180 / 90 pairs = $2.

"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings and then find the difference.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find the total calories burned, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running separately and then add them together.

Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to find out how many sets of 200 calories are in 1600 calories.
1600 / 200 = 8

Now, multiply the number of sets by the amount of water needed per set.
8 * 100 ml = 800 ml

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans) and G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans).

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3.01B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3.01:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

R = 0.99B = 0.99(1500) = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01(1500) = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:

G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 

Protein percentage = (3 grams / 100 grams) * 100 = 3%

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we can multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage:

Protein per day = 200 grams * 3% = 200 * 0.03 = 6 grams

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the protein per day by 7 to find out how many grams of protein John gets per week:

Protein per week = 6 grams * 7 = 42 grams

"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown, and then subtract the deposit he has already paid.

The base price of each implant is $2000, and he needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000.

He wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

He has already paid a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

To find out how many hours he needs to work to pay for the remaining amount, we need to divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage. His hourly wage is $15, so the number of hours he needs to work is $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it can be represented as 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, it can be represented as 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

One angle is twice the smallest angle: 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
One angle is three times the smallest angle: 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

Total amount of money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball

"To find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to first find out how many pounds Ruiz makes in an hour. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how many pounds he makes in an hour, we divide 120 by 2. 

120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour for Ruiz.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour. To find out how many pounds Marissa makes in an hour, we multiply 60 by 3/4.

60 * (3/4) = 45 pounds per hour for Marissa.

Now, we know that Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour and Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour. They both work for 12 hours a day. 

To find the total amount of chocolates they make in a day, we add their hourly production and multiply it by the number of hours they work.

Ruiz's total production = 60 * 12 = 720 pounds

Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, the total number of rotations per month is:

362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles = 145,000 rotations/month

The total number of rotations in a year is:

145,000 rotations/month * 12 months = 1,740,000 rotations/year

To find the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations per year:

10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the cost per pump, we need to first find the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings. 

Since there are 60 washings per pump, and the total cost is $24.00, we need to find the cost per pump. 

First, we convert the total cost to cents: $24.00 * 100 = 2400 cents.

Now, we divide the total cost in cents by the total number of pumps: 2400 cents / 2 pumps = 1200 cents per 2 pumps.

To find the cost per pump, we divide the cost per 2 pumps by 2: 1200 cents / 2 = 600 cents per pump.

The final answer is: 600"
"To find the total cost of the outfit, we need to first calculate the discount on the items. 

The discount on the shirt is 30% of $25, which is 0.3 * $25 = $7.50. 
The discount on the shorts is 30% of $35, which is 0.3 * $35 = $10.50.

The total discount is $7.50 + $10.50 = $18.

The original price of the outfit is $25 + $35 = $60. 
The discounted price of the outfit is $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to calculate it separately.

Joe has $50 to spend, and the discounted price of the outfit is $42. 
So, Joe will have $50 - $42 = $8 left after the purchase."
"To find the total number of pounds of butter needed, we need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make and then multiply it by the amount of butter needed per dozen croissants.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of croissants is:
4 dozen/day * 7 days = 4 * 7 = 28 dozen

Since there are 12 croissants in a dozen, the total number of croissants is:
28 dozen * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants

It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed, we multiply the total number of croissants by the amount of butter per dozen:
336 croissants * (1/4 pound/croissant) = 336 * 1/4 = 84 pounds

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of the street. 

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Cost to repave Lewis' street = Cost per meter * Length of Lewis' street
= $194 * 490
= $95,060

To find how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we need to first find the cost to repave Monica's street and then subtract it from the cost to repave Lewis' street.

Cost to repave Monica's street = Cost per meter * Length of Monica's street
= $194 * 150
= $29,100

Now, we subtract the cost to repave Monica's street from the cost to repave Lewis' street:
Cost difference = Cost to repave Lewis' street - Cost to repave Monica's street
= $95,060 - $29,100
= $65,960

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as 'x'. Since there are 10 total classes, the number of classes he will attend is 10 - x.

The total cost of the classes is $60. The cost of the classes he attends is (10 - x) * 10. The cost of the classes he misses is x * 0 (since he doesn't pay for the classes he misses).

We can set up the equation:

(10 - x) * 10 = 60

Expanding the equation:

100 - 10x = 60

Subtracting 100 from both sides:

-10x = -40

Dividing both sides by -10:

x = 4

So, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then subtract the two costs.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got $2 off because she had a voucher. So, the total cost is:
20 * 20 - 2 = 398

On the second day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, and the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost without the discount is:
20 * 30 = 600

The 10% discount on the total cost is:
600 * 0.1 = 60

So, the total cost after the discount is:
600 - 60 = 540

Now, we can find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
540 - 398 = 142

The final answer is: 142"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first month, the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Let's call the total sales from green hats in the first month ""x"". Then, we can write the equation:

400 = x/2

To find x, we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 400 * 2
x = 800

So, the total sales from green hats in the first month were $800.

2. The total sales in the first month were the sum of red and green hat sales:

Total sales in the first month = 400 + 800 = $1200

3. In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. Let's calculate the sales in the second month:

Sales in the second month = (3/4) * 1200
Sales in the second month = 900

4. To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales of both months:

Total sales in two months = 1200 + 900 = $2100

The final answer is: $2100"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and the cost of each hour.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so he only paid for 3 hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. Each hour after that costs twice the cost of the first hour, which is 2 * $15 = $30.

So, the cost of the second hour is $30 and the cost of the third hour is $30.

The total cost is $15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $30 (third hour) = $75.

The final answer is: $75"

"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori needs, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3
Total deviled egg halves needed: 16 * 3 = 48

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many eggs are needed to make 48 deviled egg halves. 

Number of deviled egg halves per egg: 2
Total eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

To find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12).

"To find the total cost of the plane and maintenance for the first year, we need to calculate the total cost of the plane, the hanger rental, and the fuel.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The hanger rental is $5000 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total hanger rental cost for the first year is:
$5000 * 12 = $60,000

The fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, so it is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total fuel cost for the first year is:
$10,000 * 12 = $120,000

The total cost of the plane and maintenance for the first year is the sum of the cost of the plane, the hanger rental, and the fuel:
$150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $230,000

1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so it took her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork.
3. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 40 minutes.

Now, let's add up the cooking times for all the food:

"To find the cost of each mixture, we need to calculate the cost of almonds and walnuts separately and then add them together.

For the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- Cost of almonds: 1/2 pound * $10/pound = $5
- Cost of walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
- Total cost of the first mixture: $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- Cost of almonds: 1/5 pound * $10/pound = $2
- Cost of walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
- Total cost of the second mixture: $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
Difference = Cost of the first mixture - Cost of the second mixture
Difference = $10 - $7
Difference = $3

"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can set up the following equation for the total number of legs:

4S + 2G = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, which means the sum of the number of sheep and geese is 20:

S + G = 20

We can solve the second equation for G:

G = 20 - S

Now, substitute G in the first equation:

4S + 2(20 - S) = 70

Expand the equation:

4S + 40 - 2S = 70

Combine like terms:

2S + 40 = 70

Subtract 40 from both sides:

2S = 30

Divide both sides by 2:

S = 15

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut.

The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound. The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 * 5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 pounds. The cost of the more expensive coffee is 7 * $6 = $42. 

The cost of the donut is $2.

The total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

Adding the cost of the bucket of fried chicken: $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00
Adding the cost of the bottle of soda: $12.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the items from the $20.00 Gus spent:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers to find the number of math teachers.

Number of math teachers = Total number of teachers - Number of history teachers
= 150 - 90
= 60 math teachers.

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours they sleep per day.

Total time spent sleeping = Number of math teachers * Hours slept per day
= 60 * 6
= 360 hours

The final answer is: 360"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Aurelia has $120.
2. Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so Kassidy has (3/4) * 120 = $90.
3. Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = $150.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money they have: 120 + 90 + 150 = $360.

To find out how much each would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them, we need to divide the total amount by 3 (since there are 3 people): 360 / 3 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"

- Next 8 days: Bad
- Next 8 days: Neutral
- Next 3 days: Good, Neutral, Good

We know that Christina had 12 good days in total, and 8 of them were in the first 8 days. So, the remaining good days are:
12 (total good days) - 8 (good days in the first 8 days) = 4

However, we are also told that the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. This means that 2 more good days are included in the total count. 

So, the total number of good days left in the month is:
4 (remaining good days) + 2 (good days in the next 3 days) = 6

"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has, which can be expressed as 2x + 3. We are also given that Janey has 21 books. 

We can set up the equation: 2x + 3 = 21

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 
2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:
x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books. 

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 20 feet to inches by multiplying 20 by 12.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches a day and its current height is 240 inches. To find the number of days it will take to reach 600 inches, we can subtract the current height from the target height and divide by the daily growth rate.

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Now, divide the remaining inches by the daily growth rate:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. 
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs 8 more toys for these dogs. Now, he has 4 (initial toys) + 8 (new toys) = 12 toys for 12 dogs.
3. When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs. So, he needs 16 more toys for these dogs. Now, he has 12 (previous toys) + 16 (new toys) = 28 toys for 28 dogs.
4. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. Now, he has 28 - 3 = 25 toys for 25 dogs.

However, the question asks for the total number of toys James needs, not the number of toys he has. Since James needs 1 toy per dog, and there are 25 dogs, he needs 25 toys.

"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we first need to determine how many signatures they have already collected. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 

Total signatures collected so far = 20 (Carol) + 44 (Jennifer) = 64 signatures.

Since they want to reach 100 signatures by the end of the summer, we need to find out how many signatures they still need to collect. 

Signatures needed = 100 (goal) - 64 (already collected) = 36 signatures.

The sisters need to collect 36 signatures to reach their goal."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to find out how much she earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Karen works in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, in two days she works 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can find out how much Karen earns in two days by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works: $20 * 6 = $120.

"To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a ratio of potatoes to hash browns as follows:

6 potatoes : 36 hash browns

To find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we can set up a proportion:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

We can then cross-multiply to solve for x:

6x = 96 * 36
6x = 3456
x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

"To find the total weight of the 9 adults, we need to multiply the average weight of an adult by the number of adults. 

Total weight = 80 kg/adult * 9 adults = 720 kg

Since the elevator supports a maximum load of 700 kg, we need to find the difference between the total weight and the maximum load.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

"To find the total number of cookies, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has. 

We know that Katarina has 68 cookies. 

Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the number of cookies each person has: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298.

Time in turtle mode = 1 hour = 60 minutes
Time in rabbit mode = 40 minutes

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to multiply the time for each mode by 0.5 (half).

Time in turtle mode = 60 * 0.5 = 30 minutes
Time in rabbit mode = 40 * 0.5 = 20 minutes

Now, we add the time for both modes to get the total time.

Total time = Time in turtle mode + Time in rabbit mode
Total time = 30 + 20
Total time = 50 minutes

"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. 

Since there are two twins and one triplet, the total age is 2T + t. We are given that their combined ages are 44, so we can write the equation:

2T + t = 44

We also know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write another equation:

T = t + 7

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

2(t + 7) + t = 44

Expanding the equation:

2t + 14 + t = 44

Combine like terms:

3t + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides:

3t = 30

Divide both sides by 3:

t = 10

Now that we know the age of the triplet, we can find the age of the older twin:

T = t + 7
T = 10 + 7
T = 17

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

The total cost of 5 lollipops and 4 candies is $3.20. The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. 

So, the cost of 4 candies is $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. 

The cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year) and 10 (the number of years).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year = 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year = 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings = 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings = 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, we can express it as 0.6x. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check, so we can write the equation: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. Subtracting 0.6x from both sides gives us 0.4x = $40. 

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.4 to find x: x = $40 / 0.4 = $100.

So, the total bill is $100. 

Since John brought $125 with him, he will leave with $125 - $100 = $25.

The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares, so it is 18 + 6 = 24.
The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares, so it is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, we add the number of each color of squares together: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68.

The total number of squares is 68, and each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

For chocolate ice cream, the factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours. So, the rate is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours. So, the rate is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours by multiplying the rate of each type of ice cream by the number of hours and adding them together:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total quarts = 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

The final answer is: 3000"
"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the discount.

Cost of croissants: 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
Cost of cinnamon rolls: 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
Cost of mini quiches: 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
Cost of blueberry muffins: 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Total cost before discount: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Discount: 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Total bill after discount: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00. Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy.

$6.00 / $1.50 = 4

However, Erin can get 1 free scoop for every 2 scoops she buys. So, for every 3 scoops, she pays for 2 and gets 1 free. 

Since Erin has $6.00, she can buy 4 scoops (paying for 2 and getting 2 free) or 2 sets of 3 scoops (paying for 4 scoops and getting 2 free). 

2 sets of 3 scoops will give her 6 scoops in total, which is more than she can afford with $6.00. 

So, Erin should buy 4 scoops of ice cream.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of candies they eat in two weeks and subtract that from their initial amount.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days (two weeks), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Ginger's remaining candies after two weeks: 100 - 56 = 44
Amy's remaining candies after two weeks: 100 - 42 = 58

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining candies from Amy's remaining candies: 58 - 44 = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total number of tiles needed, we first need to find the area of two-thirds of the bathroom. 

The area of the entire bathroom is 36 sq ft. To find two-thirds of this area, we multiply 36 by 2/3.

36 * (2/3) = 36 * 2 / 3 = 72 / 3 = 24

So, two-thirds of the bathroom is 24 sq ft. 

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, we multiply the area of two-thirds of the bathroom by 24.

24 * 24 = 576

The final answer is: 576"
"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the cost of picking the blueberries and the cost of buying them at the store, then subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store.

Cost of picking blueberries: $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 (per pound) * 30 (pounds) = $20 + $45 = $65

Cost of buying blueberries at the store: $2.5 (per pound) * 30 (pounds) = $75

Now, let's calculate the savings: $75 (cost at the store) - $65 (cost of picking) = $10

"To find the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * 700 = $70

New price of each computer = Original price + Increase in price
= $700 + $70
= $770

Now, we need to find the total amount of money the company paid for 500 computers at the new price.

Total amount = Number of computers * New price of each computer

"To find the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends, we first need to find the total number of slices they ate. Since there are 5 people in total (Bryce and 4 friends), and 2/3 of their pizzas were eaten, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by these 5 people as follows:

5 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 5 * 8 = 40 slices

However, this is the total number of slices eaten by 5 people, but we know that 2 of these people ate 2/3 of their pizzas, and 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas. So, we need to find the total number of slices eaten by 3 people who ate 2/3 of their pizzas. 

3 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 3 * 8 = 24 slices

Now, we need to find the total number of slices eaten by the 2 friends who ate ¾ of their pizzas. 

2 people * 3/4 * 12 slices/person = 2 * 9 = 18 slices

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by all 5 people. 

24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices

Since there were 5 people and each pizza had 12 slices, the total number of slices was 5 * 12 = 60 slices.

Now, we can find the number of slices left by subtracting the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices.

60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

8 feet = 8 * 12 = 96 inches
Adding the 4 inches, we get:
96 + 4 = 100 inches

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches, and it is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes ""x"". Then, we can write the equation:

100 = 9x + 10

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation, we get:

90 = 9x

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9, we get:

x = 10

First, let's find the number of windows smashed from students' cars:
Number of students' cars = 64
Number of windows per car = 4
Total windows from students' cars = 64 * 4 = 256
Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, so the number of windows smashed from students' cars = 256 * 1/4 = 64

Next, let's find the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars:
Number of teachers' cars = 32
Number of windows per car = 2
Total windows from teachers' cars = 32 * 2 = 64
Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, so the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars = 64 * 3/4 = 48

- Weekdays: 5 days * 60 chairs/day = 300 chairs
- Weekends: 2 days * 100 chairs/day = 200 chairs
- Total chairs rented in a week: 300 + 200 = 500 chairs

Now, let's multiply the number of chairs rented in a week by 8:

500 chairs/week * 8 weeks = 4000 chairs

The final answer is: 4000"
"To find the number of bananas Gunther had at the end, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.

Arnold stole half of the bananas, so the number of bananas left is 48 / 2 = 24.

Gunther added 25 bananas, so the total number of bananas is 24 + 25 = 49.

Arnold stole 12 bananas, so the number of bananas left is 49 - 12 = 37.

Gunther added 6 bananas, so the total number of bananas is 37 + 6 = 43.

The final number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43."
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year, we need to first find out how much they will pay per month and then multiply it by 12.

The monthly electricity bill is $100. Since there are 4 roommates, they will divide the bill equally among themselves. 

$100 / 4 = $25 per roommate per month.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly amount by 12:

$25 * 12 = $300 per roommate per year.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find out how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to subtract the number of broken items from the total number of items sent.

First, let's find the total number of glasses and plates sent:

- Glasses: 8 dozen = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
- Plates: 4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

Now, let's subtract the number of broken items:

- Broken glasses: 10
- Broken plates: 6

So, the number of glasses Jeff has now is: 96 - 10 = 86
The number of plates Jeff has now is: 48 - 6 = 42

The final answer is: 
Glasses: 86
Plates: 42"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading small stickers.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (40 - 20 = 20) for small buttons. 
Since each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has:
- Small buttons from trading small stickers: 27
- Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20
- Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60

Total buttons = 27 + 20 + 60 = 107

The final answer is: 107"

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Since there are twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against, which is 33. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2x, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2:

2x = 2 * 11
= 22

The final answer is: 22"

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.
2. One third of the Pomeranians are girls.
3. There are 6 Pomeranian girls.

From point 2, we know that 1/3 of the Pomeranians are girls, so the total number of Pomeranians is 3 times the number of Pomeranian girls. 

Number of Pomeranians = 3 * 6 = 18

From point 1, we know that 2/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Since we now know the number of Pomeranians, we can set up an equation to find the total number of puppies:

2/3 * Total number of puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total number of puppies = 18 * (3/2) = 27

"To find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has after receiving the allowance from his sister.

Jayden initially had $70. 
Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. 
So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. 
To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as x. 

Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second, the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles.

The third house needs double the first, so the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + x/2 + x = 250

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms:

5x = 500

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

Now that we know x, we can find the number of cases of shingles the third house needs, which is x = 100.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Ezra has read 300 books this hour. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, Ahmed must have read half the number of books Ezra read. 

So, Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books this hour.

Ezra decided to read 150 more books. 

To find the total number of books Ezra will have read, we add the 150 more books to the 300 he already read: 300 + 150 = 450.

Now, we need to find the total number of books both Ezra and Ahmed have read. We already know that Ezra will have read 450 books and Ahmed has read 150 books. 

So, the total number of books they have read is 450 + 150 = 600.

"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then add them together.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Her earnings for the hours are 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for the hours are 2 hours * $15/hour = $30. Since she teaches more than 3 classes is not true, she does not earn an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Now, we add the earnings for both days: $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

"To find the percentage of the weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer, we first need to determine the total time she has available and the time she spends on other activities.

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time
Remaining time = Total time available - Time spent reading = 12 - 3 = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Total time available - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
= 12 - 3 - 3
= 6 hours

To find the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time available and multiply by 100:
Percentage = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time available) * 100
= (6 / 12) * 100
= 0.5 * 100

"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps:

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils and gave 1/2 of them to Brandon. 
   1/2 of 50 is 50 * 1/2 = 25 pencils given to Brandon.
   So, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

2. Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie.
   3/5 of 25 is 25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils given to Charlie.
   So, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

Time to drive to the museum: 
Distance = 150 miles
Speed = 75 mph
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 / 75
Time = 2 hours

Time to drive back home:
Time = 2 hours (since the distance is the same)

Total time driving = 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours

Total time Jack is gone from home = Time driving + Time at the museum
Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 10 hours

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so the number of movies in series is 600 / 3 = 200.

The cost of the movies in series is 200 * $6 = $1200.

Next, let's find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies. The remaining movies are 600 - 200 = 400. 40% of 400 is 0.4 * 400 = 160. So, the number of older movies is 160.

The cost of the older movies is 160 * $5 = $800.

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies. We already know that 200 movies are in series and 160 are older movies. So, the number of remaining movies is 600 - 200 - 160 = 240.

The cost of the remaining movies is 240 * $10 = $2400.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies. So, the total cost is $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400.

"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance they drove and the distance they hiked, then add them together.

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's find the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they drove is 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

Next, let's find the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they hiked is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Now, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked to find the total distance to their vacation spot. 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: 330"
"To find the difference between their scores, we need to calculate the scores of Ava and Emma separately and then find the difference.

Let's assume Emma's score is x. 

Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's enemy score is x + 8. 
Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, Ava's berry score is x + 3.
Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, Ava's timer score is (60 - (x + 4)) = 56 - x.

The total score for Emma is x + 0 (since she doesn't jump on any extra enemies or collect any extra berries) + 0 (since she finishes the level at the same time as the timer) = x.

The total score for Ava is (x + 8) + (x + 3) + (56 - x) = 2x + 11.

The difference between their scores is (2x + 11) - x = x + 11.

However, we don't know the value of x. We need to find the value of x to calculate the difference.

Since we don't have any information about the value of x, we can assume that the difference between their scores is the difference between their enemy and berry scores, and the difference in their timer scores.

The difference in their enemy scores is 8.
The difference in their berry scores is 3.
The difference in their timer scores is (60 - (x + 4)) - 60 = -4 - x.

The total difference is 8 + 3 + (-4 - x) = 7 - x.

However, we are given that Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma. This means that the timer score difference is negative, which is not possible. This means that our initial assumption that Emma's score is x is incorrect.

Let's try another approach. 

Let's assume Emma's enemy score is y. Then Ava's enemy score is y + 8.

Let's assume Emma's berry score is z. Then Ava's berry score is z + 3.

Let's assume Emma's timer score is w. Then Ava's timer score is w - 4.

The total score for Emma is y + z + w.

The total score for Ava is (y + 8) + (z + 3) + (w - 4) = y + z + w + 7.

The difference between their scores is (y + z + w) - (y + z + w + 7) = -7.

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to find the difference between their scores in terms of y, z, and w.

The difference between their scores is (y + 8) + (z + 3) - y - z - (w - 4) = 11 - w.

However, we are given that Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma. This means that the timer score difference is negative, which is not possible. This means that our initial assumption that Emma's timer score is w is incorrect.

Let's try another approach.

Let's assume Emma's timer score is w. Then Ava's timer score is w - 4.

The difference in their timer scores is w - (w - 4) = 4.

The difference in their enemy scores is 8.

The difference in their berry scores is 3.

The total difference is 8 + 3 + 4 = 15.

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to find the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. 

The two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each will be 2 x 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the cost of the other two pizzas. 

64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

The total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is the sum of the times they ride on usual days and the times they ride on the extra days, which is 15 + 12 = 27.

"Let's break down the information given:

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.

After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. The number of orange fish he bought would then be 2x (since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish).

The total number of fish in the pet store tank was 17, and this includes both white and orange fish. Since Bob bought all the fish from the tank, the total number of fish he bought is 17.

The total number of fish in Bob's pond after buying more fish is 7 (initial fish) + 17 (bought fish) = 24.

The number of white fish in Bob's pond after buying more fish is 4 (initial white fish) + x (white fish bought).

The number of orange fish in Bob's pond after buying more fish is 3 (initial orange fish) + 2x (orange fish bought).

Since the total number of fish in the pond is 24, we can set up the equation:

4 + x + 3 + 2x = 24

Combine like terms:

3x + 7 = 24

Subtract 7 from both sides:

3x = 17

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 17/3

x = 5.67

Since the number of fish must be a whole number, and we are dealing with a real-world scenario where you can't buy a fraction of a fish, we need to re-evaluate the problem.

However, the question asks for the number of white fish Bob bought, and we have found that x = 5.67. Since we can't buy a fraction of a fish, we need to consider the context of the problem. The question states that Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish after buying more fish. This means that the number of white fish must be a whole number.

Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the total number of orange fish. If Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish, and he initially had 3 orange fish, then the number of orange fish after buying more fish is 3 + 2x.

The total number of fish in the pond is 24, and the number of white fish is 4 + x. The number of orange fish is 3 + 2x. We can set up the equation:

4 + x + 3 + 2x = 24

Combine like terms:

3x + 7 = 24

Subtract 7 from both sides:

3x = 17

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 17/3

However, we know that x must be a whole number. Let's try a different approach.

Since Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish, and he initially had 3 orange fish, the number of white fish must be a whole number that allows the total number of orange fish to be twice that number.

Let's try x = 4. If x = 4, then the number of white fish Bob bought is 4, and the number of orange fish he bought is 2x = 8.

The total number of fish in the pond after buying more fish is 7 (initial fish) + 17 (bought fish) = 24.

The number of white fish in Bob's pond after buying more fish is 4 (initial white fish) + 4 (white fish bought) = 8.

The number of orange fish in Bob's pond after buying more fish is 3 (initial orange fish) + 8 (orange fish bought) = 11.

Since Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish, this solution satisfies the condition.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in a week and then multiply it by the fuel efficiency and the price of gas.

First, let's calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week:
Distance per day = 2 * 5 miles (since it's a round trip) = 10 miles
Total distance per week = 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles/week

Now, let's calculate the amount of fuel consumed per week:
Fuel efficiency = 10 MPG
Fuel consumed per week = Total distance per week / Fuel efficiency = 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week

Finally, let's calculate the total cost per week:
Price of gas = $3/gallon
Total cost per week = Fuel consumed per week * Price of gas = 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent, then add them together.

First, let's find the value of the quarters. Carrie was given 140 quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25. 

Value of quarters = 140 * $0.25 = $35

Next, let's find the value of the twenties she spent. Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. 

Number of twenties spent = 10 * (3/5) = 6

Value of twenties spent = 6 * $20 = $120

Now, let's add the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties to find the total amount of money she paid for lunch.

Total amount spent = $35 + $120 = $155

"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and the total number of eggplants separately and then add them together.

Total number of tomatoes = Number of tomato plants * Number of tomatoes per plant
Total number of tomatoes = 5 * 22
Total number of tomatoes = 110

Total number of eggplants = Number of eggplant plants * Number of eggplants per plant
Total number of eggplants = 8 * 4
Total number of eggplants = 32

Total number of fruits = Total number of tomatoes + Total number of eggplants
Total number of fruits = 110 + 32
Total number of fruits = 142

The final answer is: 142"
"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to find the total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 = 0.25 or 25% of the total. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 = 0.125 or 12.5% of the total.

The total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 25% + 12.5% = 37.5%.

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED TVs, the percentage of OLED TVs sold is 100% - 37.5% = 62.5%.

Now, we can find the number of OLED TVs sold by multiplying the total number of TVs sold (40) by the percentage of OLED TVs sold (0.625):

40 * 0.625 = 25

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first determine how much the school will cover. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we can calculate this as:

School's contribution = Total cost / 2
School's contribution = $300 / 2
School's contribution = $150

Now, we know that John has $50 and the school is covering $150, so the total amount covered is $150 + $50 = $200.

To find out how much John is missing, we subtract the total amount covered from the total cost of the trip:

Amount John is missing = Total cost - Total amount covered
Amount John is missing = $300 - $200
Amount John is missing = $100

The final answer is: $100"
"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature at night. 

Given that it's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, and it was 45 degrees during the day, we can calculate the temperature at night as follows:

Temperature at night = Temperature during the day - 33
Temperature at night = 45 - 33
Temperature at night = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house up to at least 32 degrees. 

To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we can calculate the difference between the current temperature at night and the temperature at which the pipes won't freeze:

Difference = Temperature at which pipes won't freeze - Temperature at night
Difference = 32 - 12
Difference = 20 degrees

Since each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, we can find out how many logs Carson needs to burn by dividing the difference by the heat each log provides:

Number of logs = Difference / Heat per log
Number of logs = 20 / 5
Number of logs = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of seashells, we first need to find the number of groups and the number of groups that brought back seashells.

The total number of people is 90, and they are split into 9-person groups. To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of people by the number of people per group:

90 / 9 = 10

So, there are 10 groups.

3/5 of the groups brought back seashells. To find the number of groups that brought back seashells, we multiply the total number of groups by 3/5:

10 * (3/5) = 6

So, 6 groups brought back seashells.

Each group that brought back seashells had 2 seashells. To find the total number of seashells, we multiply the number of groups that brought back seashells by the number of seashells each group brought:

6 * 2 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the number of people on the train after the two stops, we need to subtract the number of people who got off and add the number of people who got on.

Initially, there are 172 people on the train.

At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
172 - 47 = 125

Then, 13 people get on, so we add 13 to 125:
125 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
138 - 38 = 100

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total salary for each month, then multiply it by 3.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After 3 months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (hired in the first month) + 20 (hired in the second month) + 20 (hired in the third month) = 260 employees

The total salary for each month is the number of employees multiplied by the salary per employee:
200 employees * $4000 = $800,000 per month

Since the company pays this amount every month for 3 months, the total amount paid is:
$800,000 * 3 = $2,400,000

The final answer is: $2,400,000"
"To find the total time the choir will be caroling, we need to add the time it takes to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and the time it takes to sing ""Jingle Bells"" once.

Time for ""Deck the Halls"" = 150 seconds

"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial hourly wage is $10. After 2 months, he gets a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. After another year, he gets a raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, so her hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours:

Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = 20 * 11.50 = $230
Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = 20 * 10.50 = $210

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by students and teachers separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the total number of students:
Number of classes = 40
Number of students per class = 25
Total number of students = Number of classes * Number of students per class
Total number of students = 40 * 25
Total number of students = 1000

Next, let's find the total number of trees planted by students:
Each student plants 1 tree
Total number of students = 1000
Total number of trees planted by students = Total number of students
Total number of trees planted by students = 1000

Now, let's find the total number of teachers:
Number of classes = 40
Number of teachers per class = 3
Total number of teachers = Number of classes * Number of teachers per class
Total number of teachers = 40 * 3
Total number of teachers = 120

Next, let's find the total number of trees planted by teachers:
Each teacher plants 2 trees
Total number of teachers = 120
Total number of trees planted by teachers = Total number of teachers * 2
Total number of trees planted by teachers = 120 * 2
Total number of trees planted by teachers = 240

Now, let's find the total number of trees planted:
Total number of trees planted by students = 1000
Total number of trees planted by teachers = 240
Total number of trees planted = Total number of trees planted by students + Total number of trees planted by teachers

"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal together.

Number of puppies = 3
Number of koalas = 5
Number of zebras = 2
Number of frogs = 4

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find the number of stuffed goats that will make up 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Let's represent the number of stuffed goats as 'x'. We can set up the equation:

(x + 14) / 14 = 0.3

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 14:

x + 14 = 4.2

Now, we subtract 14 from both sides of the equation:

x = 4.2 - 14
x = -9.8

However, since we cannot have a negative number of stuffed animals, this means that Bubbles already has more than 14 stuffed animals, and the 30% calculation is not possible with the current number of stuffed animals. 

To find the correct number of stuffed goats, we need to find the minimum number of stuffed animals Bubbles needs to have to make 30% of them stuffed goats. Let's represent the total number of stuffed animals as 'y'. We can set up the equation:

0.3y = x

Since we don't know the value of 'x', we need to find the minimum value of 'y' that will make 'x' a whole number. We can try different values of 'y' until we find one that works.

Let's try y = 20:

0.3(20) = 6

Since 6 is a whole number, Bubbles needs at least 20 stuffed animals to make 30% of them stuffed goats. 

Now, we can find the number of stuffed goats by multiplying 0.3 by 20:

Number of stuffed goats = 0.3(20)
= 6

"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in 2 weeks and 1 week.

In 2 weeks, there are 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in 2 weeks.

In 1 week, there are 7 days. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in 1 week.

Total hours Kris has played = 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours she has played from the target hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between the two distances.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 70 miles/hour x 2 hours = 140 miles

The difference in distance between the two cars is:
Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car."

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340, and the total number of third-graders is 500. 

The number of fourth-graders who passed is 40, and the total number of fourth-graders is 100.

The number of fifth-graders who passed is 2 times the pass rate of the fourth graders. Since 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed, the pass rate is 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%. Therefore, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 0.4 * 400 = 160.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 160 (fifth-graders) = 540.

The total number of students in the school is 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students: 540/1000 = 0.54 or 54%.

"To find the total number of glass chips Milo has, we multiply the number of chips in one bag by the number of bags he has: 72 chips/bag * 2 bags = 144 chips.

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12 to find the total number of square inches: 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches.

Since the mosaic is three inches tall, and it's a square mosaic, we need to find the length of the side of the square. We know that the area of a square is side^2, and the area is 12 square inches. So, we take the square root of 12 to find the side length: √12 ≈ 3.46 inches.

However, since the question asks for the length of the mosaic, and we know the height is three inches, we can assume the mosaic is a rectangle, not a square. We can find the length by dividing the total number of square inches by the height: 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of tea left, we need to calculate the total amount of tea drank by the students. 

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea drank by all students is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. 

So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party in gallons is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to first determine how many candies he has in total. 

Dale initially ordered 100 candies and then ordered 100 more. So, the total number of candies he has is 100 + 100 = 200.

However, he has already sold 150 candies. To find out how many he still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies he has:

200 - 150 = 50

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

"To find the number of students at the end of May, we need to calculate the number of times the initial number of students doubles in a year. 

Since the number of students doubles every month, it will double 12 times in a year (from January to December). 

The initial number of students is 10. 

Doubling 10 for 12 times:
- January: 10 * 2 = 20
- February: 20 * 2 = 40
- March: 40 * 2 = 80
- April: 80 * 2 = 160
- May: 160 * 2 = 320

The number of students at the end of May is 320. 

To find the number of additional students, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (7 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

Total marshmallows used = 9 + 9 = 18
Marshmallows dropped = 3
Total marshmallows lost = 18 + 3 = 21
Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores each kid can have is equal to the number of marshmallows left divided by 2.

Number of S'mores each kid can have = 14 / 2 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then multiply it by the cost per minute.

Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. 
Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, the cost per minute for Jack is 1/20 dollars per minute.

The two friends who are worse than Jack can play for half as long, so they play for 240 / 2 = 120 minutes each. 
The cost per minute for these friends is also 1/20 dollars per minute.

The friend who is better than Jack can play for 1.5 times as long, so they play for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes.
The cost per minute for this friend is also 1/20 dollars per minute.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each person:
- Jack: 240 minutes * (1/20) dollars/minute = 12 dollars
- Two friends: 2 * (120 minutes * (1/20) dollars/minute) = 12 dollars
- Better friend: 360 minutes * (1/20) dollars/minute = 18 dollars

The total cost is 12 + 12 + 18 = 42 dollars.

"Let's break down the information given:

- The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces.
- The amount of citrus zest is equal to the amount of fragrance.
- The amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x. Then the amount of salt (and sugar) is 2x, and the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total amount of the mixture is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: x (citrus zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces.

Combine like terms: 8x = 10.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 10/8 = 1.25.

Now that we know x, we can find the amount of oil: 4x = 4 * 1.25 = 5.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars. So, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

4. In total, Joe sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars. So, he gave away a total of 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

5. To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the total number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first find the total number of cars in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break.

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When he got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 of the cars had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 had left, so 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars had left.

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35.

However, the question asks for the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break. This would be the number of cars that were present when he got out of class for the lunch break, which is 35.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 
In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. 
So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, we add Sasha's points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages of dog food by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food: 88 - 36 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341. We can write an equation to represent this:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs.

She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had (1/3) * 9 = 3 yellow eggs.

To find the total number of eggs, we add the number of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the cost of the book.

The cost of shipping is calculated as follows:
- Cost per pound: $0.35
- Weight of the book: 4 pounds
- Cost per mile: $0.08
- Distance: 20 miles
- Total cost of shipping = (cost per pound * weight) + (cost per mile * distance)
= (0.35 * 4) + (0.08 * 20)
= 1.40 + 1.60
= 3.00

The refund amount is 75% of the book's purchase price:
- Purchase price: $32
- Refund amount = 0.75 * purchase price
= 0.75 * 32
= 24

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:
- Total cost of shipping: $3.00
- Refund amount: $24
- Amount lost = total cost of shipping - refund amount
= 3.00 - 24
However, this is incorrect because the refund amount is greater than the shipping cost. The correct calculation is:
Amount lost = 0 (since the refund is greater than the shipping cost)"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to first calculate the total amount of money she spent.

Mulan initially had $40. Her father gave her $100, so she now has $40 + $100 = $140.

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of the jeans is 2 x $30 = $60.

She also buys a bag for $20.

The total amount of money she spent is $60 (jeans) + $20 (bag) = $80.

Now, we subtract the total amount she spent from the total amount she had: $140 - $80 = $60.

Mulan has $60 left.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars.
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Total production for the first three weeks = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Total monthly production is 50,000 bars. To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

The final answer is: 14000"
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week:

1. Time spent recording videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes
2. Time spent writing songs: 2 hours = 120 minutes
3. Time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes

Total time spent on TikTok in a week = 72 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes = 282 minutes

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4:
282 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 1128 minutes/month

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
1128 minutes / 60 = 18.8 hours

The final answer is: 18.8"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of the initial installation is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, we need to subtract these from the total number of items she has:

- Mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2
- Chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1
- Pictures: 20 - 10 = 10

The number of additional items is 2 mirrors, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The total number of additional items is 2 + 1 + 10 = 13.

The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item, so the total cost of the additional items is 13 * $15.00 = $195.00.

The total cost is the sum of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30.00 by 0.4: $30.00 * 0.4 = $12.00.
4. To find the total amount Roy has saved, we add the 40% more to Anthony's savings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to find out how high Saskay can lift a mountain, then multiply it by 12, then multiply that by 4, and finally multiply that by 10.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, Saskay can lift 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we need to convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12. 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

"To find the total distance traveled by Mason, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance covered in the first 4 hours + Distance covered in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total distance = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, one kangaroo would take 3 times as long, which is 18 * 3 = 54 hours.

Now, we know that the turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, if one kangaroo takes 54 hours, one turtle would take twice as long, which is 54 * 2 = 108 hours.

However, we have four turtles, and they are traveling together. When multiple objects travel at the same speed, their combined time is the same as the time it would take for one object to travel the same distance. Therefore, the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway is the same as the time it takes for one turtle, which is 108 hours.

The final answer is: 108"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
- Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

To find the total number of dishes they made together, we add the number of dishes each person made: 
20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140

4. She earned $150 from her part-time job.
5. Her mom gave her $80.
6. After all these, she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + 150 + 80 = 400 + 50

Combine the constants:
x + 230 = 450

Subtract 230 from both sides:
x = 220

So, Erika has $220 in her purse."

"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day. 

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we can divide 25 by 5 to find out how many cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

25 / 5 = 5

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to subtract 3 from the total number of cows needed to find out how many more cows he needs.

5 - 3 = 2

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which is 1/6 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 1/6:
12 * (1/6) = 12/6 = 2 millimeters

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which is 2/3 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 2/3:
12 * (2/3) = 24/3 = 8 millimeters

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which is 1/2 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 1/2:
12 * (1/2) = 12/2 = 6 millimeters

"Let's denote my age as 'x'. Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age is x + 3. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so her age is 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 10 = 87.

Subtract 10 from both sides: 5x = 77.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 15.4.

Since age cannot be a decimal, we need to re-examine the equation. Let's re-examine the equation: 5x + 10 = 87.

Subtract 10 from both sides: 5x = 77.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 15.4.

However, since age cannot be a decimal, we need to re-examine the equation again. Let's try to find the closest integer that satisfies the equation. We can try x = 15.

Substitute x = 15 into the equation: 5(15) + 10 = 75 + 10 = 85.

Since 85 is not equal to 87, we need to try another integer. Let's try x = 16.

Substitute x = 16 into the equation: 5(16) + 10 = 80 + 10 = 90.

Since 90 is greater than 87, we need to try another integer. Let's try x = 15.5.

"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs, we need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required and then divide that by the number of glue sticks in each pack.

Total number of students: 27
Number of glue sticks per student: 2
Total number of glue sticks required: 27 * 2 = 54

Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by 8 to find out how many packs are needed:
54 / 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at the given point over the three days.

Day 1: 4000 gallons
Day 2: 4000 * 2 = 8000 gallons
Day 3: 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons

Total amount of water passing through the river at that point = 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons

The final answer is: 24000"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. 

Let's denote the initial number of infected people as P0 = 10, and the number of people each infected person infects as r = 6.

The number of infected people after one day is P1 = P0 * r = 10 * 6 = 60.

The number of infected people after two days is P2 = P1 * r = 60 * 6 = 360.

The number of infected people after three days is P3 = P2 * r = 360 * 6 = 2160.

Therefore, the total number of people infected after three days is 2160.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of the amount Rafaela received and subtract it from Rafaela's total. 

Rafaela received 40 * $20 = $800.

10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80.

So, Julieta received $800 - $80 = $720.

The total amount of money they received altogether is $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to first calculate the total number of oranges given to her children.

Jennifer gave her 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so the total number of oranges given to her daughters is 3 x 2 = 6 oranges.

She also gave her son 3 oranges.

In total, Jennifer gave away 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges, so to find out how many she remained with, we subtract the number of oranges given away from the initial number of oranges:

12 (initial oranges) - 9 (oranges given away) = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each person is:
- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices sold and then multiply it by the price per slice.

Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, she baked a total of 2 * 5 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * $0.50 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We are given that G = S + 30 and G = 70.

Since G = S + 30 and G = 70, we can substitute G in the first equation with 70:

70 = S + 30

Now, we can solve for S by subtracting 30 from both sides:

70 - 30 = S
40 = S

Now that we know S, we can find the total number of coins by adding S and G:

Total = S + G
Total = 40 + 70
Total = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos eaten by the students and Mr. George.

Number of students = 50
Number of burritos per student = 10
Total burritos eaten by students = 50 * 10 = 500

Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

Total burritos eaten = 500 (by students) + 20 (by Mr. George) = 520

Total burritos ordered = 600

Total leftover burritos = Total burritos ordered - Total burritos eaten
= 600 - 520

"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first find the number of green and blue cars.

Let's start with the number of green cars. We know that there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars. Since there are 12 red cars, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

Next, we know that there are 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars. Since there are 10 green cars, the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We are given the following information:

1. S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
2. A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)
3. S + A + F = 85 (Together, they have 85 books)

We can substitute the first equation into the third equation to get:
(A + 25) + A + F = 85
Combine like terms:
2A + 25 + F = 85

Now, substitute the second equation into the above equation:
2(F - 12) + 25 + F = 85
Expand the equation:
2F - 24 + 25 + F = 85
Combine like terms:
3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3:
F = 28

The final answer is: 28"
"To find the weight of the carrots, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the weight of the carrots is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The weight of the carrots is 7 pounds."
"To find out how many boxes of jello Greg needs, we need to calculate the total number of jello cups he needs. Since there are 30 kids and each kid will get 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120.

Since one box of jello makes 10 jello cups, the number of boxes needed is 120 / 10 = 12.

The cost of one box of jello is $1.25, so the total cost will be 12 * $1.25 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total cost of the phones, we multiply the number of phones by the cost per phone:

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to find out how much Keenan spends in a month. 

Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays 40% of the cost. 

40% of $400 is 0.4 * 400 = $160. 

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we need to divide the amount Keenan spends in a month by 4 to find out how much he spends per week. 

$160 / 4 = $40.

"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them together.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. First, we need to find out how many pieces were left after the first two days. 
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces.

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26. 
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, we add the number of pieces he ate on each day:

"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we first need to find the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of one bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of one bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
2 bottles of water = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to determine her hourly rate. 

We know that Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of dog walking. 

To find her hourly rate, we divide the total amount earned ($33) by the number of hours worked (3). 

Hourly rate = Total amount earned / Number of hours worked
Hourly rate = $33 / 3
Hourly rate = $11

Now that we know her hourly rate, we can find out how much she would earn after 12 hours by multiplying her hourly rate by the number of hours worked.

Total amount earned after 12 hours = Hourly rate * Number of hours worked
Total amount earned after 12 hours = $11 * 12
Total amount earned after 12 hours = $132

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she gets from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
Amy correctly answers 80% of 10 questions, so she answers 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correctly.
Each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, so she gets 8 * 1 = 8 points from multiple-choice questions.

For true/false questions: 
Amy correctly answers 90% of 20 questions, so she answers 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correctly.
Each true/false question is worth 1 point, so she gets 18 * 1 = 18 points from true/false questions.

For long-answer questions: 
Amy correctly answers 60% of 5 questions, so she answers 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correctly.
Each long-answer question is worth 5 points, so she gets 3 * 5 = 15 points from long-answer questions.

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens, we can calculate this as:

3/5 * 300 = (3 * 300) / 5
= 900 / 5
= 180

So, Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens.

Next, we know that he needs to make a profit of $2000 by selling these chickens at $50 each. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of chickens by the selling price:

180 * $50 = $9000

Since he needs to make a profit of $2000, the total cost of the chickens must be the total revenue minus the profit:

Total cost = Total revenue - Profit
= $9000 - $2000
= $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"Let's break down the problem. 

Since Julie sold 14 glasses and the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses, we can say that each boy sold 32 - 14 = 18 glasses.

To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we need to subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold. 

So, 14 (Julie's glasses) - 18 (Micah's glasses) = -4.

However, since we can't have a negative number of glasses, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The boys sold an equal number of glasses, so if they sold 18 glasses each, the total number of glasses they sold is 18 + 18 = 36. But we know that the total number of glasses sold is 32, so the boys actually sold 32 - 14 = 18 glasses in total, which means each boy sold 18 / 2 = 9 glasses.

Now, let's recalculate the difference: 14 (Julie's glasses) - 9 (Micah's glasses) = 5.

"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to first calculate how much money she will make from selling the rope. 

The rope is 20 meters long, and her friend wants to buy it for $2 a meter. So, the total amount she will make is 20 * 2 = $40.

Next, we need to calculate how much the new rope will cost. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter, and Sarah wants to buy a rope of the same length, which is 20 meters. So, the total cost of the new rope is 20 * 1.5 = $30.

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount Sarah made from selling the old rope to find out how much money she will have left over: 40 - 30 = $10.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Melanie's current age be x.

In 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. This means that her current age plus 10 years is equal to 18. We can write this as an equation:

x + 10 = 18

To find Melanie's current age, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

x = 18 - 10
x = 8

So, Melanie's current age is 8 years.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's call this number y. We can write this as an equation:

Melanie's age in y years = 3 * Melanie's current age
8 + y = 3 * 8

To find y, we can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

8 + y - 8 = 3 * 8 - 8
y = 24 - 8
y = 16

However, this is the number of years after her current age. To find the total number of years from now, we need to add 10 (the number of years that have already passed) to y:

Total years = y + 10
Total years = 16 + 10
Total years = 26

The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 * 2 * $10 = $120, since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.
The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 * ($4 / 2) = $14, since each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.

The total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart is $10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156.

Kelly's budget is $65, so the amount of money she has left in her budget is $65 - $156 = -$91.

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means that Kelly has overspent her budget by $91."
"Let's denote the runtime of Elaina's usual concert as x minutes. 

Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, the runtime of the final concert without the encore is 2x minutes. 

Adding the 15-minute encore, the total runtime of the final concert is 2x + 15 minutes.

We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 = 65

Subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 50

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 25

The runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he had initially.

Argo initially had 200 toys. He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. 

First, let's add up the number of toys he gave away: 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Now, let's subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys: 200 - 150 = 50

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.

On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Friday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday and Wednesday, so they make 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, let's add the number of chimichangas made on each day:
125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500

The final answer is: 500"
"To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs. 

Let's assume the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is x. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the total number of microphones arranged in pairs is 2x.

However, we know that 20% of the total 50 microphones won't fit, which means 80% of the microphones will be arranged in pairs. 

We can set up the equation: 80% of 50 = 2x

To find 80% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.8: 
50 * 0.8 = 40

Now we have the equation: 40 = 2x

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
x = 40 / 2
x = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, Jerry counts 6 birds in the bushes.

Then, 2/3 of 6 is (2/3) * 6 = 4 birds flying overhead.

Next, there are 3 groups of 8 birds each, so the total number of birds feeding is 3 * 8 = 24.

Now, we add the number of birds in each group together: 6 (in the bushes) + 4 (flying overhead) + 24 (feeding) = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to subtract the number of cookies Lani ate from the total number of cookies she baked, and then divide the result by the number of jars.

Total cookies baked = 55
Cookies eaten = 5
Cookies left = 55 - 5 = 50

Number of jars = 5

Cookies per jar = Cookies left / Number of jars
Cookies per jar = 50 / 5
Cookies per jar = 10

"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the number of flowering plants, we first need to find the number of indoor and outdoor plants.

One-fourth of the plants are indoor plants: 100 * (1/4) = 25 indoor plants.

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75 plants.

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants: 75 * (2/3) = 50 outdoor plants.

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants: 75 - 50 = 25 flowering plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25/100) * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we divide both sides by 11:

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which is five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55

The final answer is: 55"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Ellen eats 2 carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day.
- The salad costs $6.
- The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.
- The total cost of Ellen's daily goods is $11.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

2x + 6 + 3 = 11

where x is the cost of one carrot.

Combine the constants:
2x + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides:
2x = 2

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 1

The cost of one carrot is $1."
"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is 3x. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is 5x.

The total amount of money Tasha made from mowing lawns is the sum of the money she made from mowing each lawn, which is $6x + 6(3x) + 6(5x) = 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x.

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns. Since we are given that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, we can set up the equation 54x + y = 80, where y is the amount of money she made from lemonade sales.

Since we know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, we can substitute 6 for 6x in the equation 54x + y = 80. This gives us 18 + y = 80.

Now, we can solve for y by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation: y = 80 - 18 = 62.

The final answer is: $62"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to find Christian's weight first, then subtract 5 kg from it.

Martin's weight is 55 kg.
Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"To find the total amount John earns from renting his car, we need to multiply the number of times he rents his car by the number of hours he rents it each time, and then multiply that by his hourly rate.

Number of times he rents his car: 10
Number of hours he rents his car each time: 3
Hourly rate: $25

Total hours rented per month: 10 * 3 = 30 hours
Total amount earned: 30 hours * $25/hour = $750

Now, we need to subtract his car payment from the total amount earned to find the profit.

Profit = Total amount earned - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Martha initially had some notebooks, but we don't know the exact number. Let's call the number of notebooks Martha had initially ""x"".
2. Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, so Joseph had 3x notebooks.
3. Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so now she has x + 5 notebooks.
4. We are told that after buying 5 more notebooks, Martha had a total of 7 notebooks. So, we can set up the equation: x + 5 = 7
5. To solve for x, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: x = 7 - 5
6. x = 2
7. Now that we know Martha had 2 notebooks initially, we can find out how many notebooks Joseph had: Joseph had 3x = 3(2) = 6 notebooks.
8. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has: 7 - 6 = 1

"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we first need to find the distance rowed by Anis. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. 

1/5 of 50 miles is 50 * (1/5) = 10 miles. 

So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

The total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis is 50 + 60 = 110 miles.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we first need to determine the total number of cookies left after Susan's husband took some. 

Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies, so the number of cookies left is 100 - 4 = 96.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies equally among 6 nephews. To do this, we divide 96 by 6.

96 / 6 = 16

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today.

So, Denise's total pages read is 10 + 18 = 28 pages, and Daniel's total pages read is 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total: 28 - 13 = 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bowls of soup Calvin's family will use for dinner and then divide that number by the number of child-sized bowls.

Calvin, his wife, and their two children make a total of 4 adults and 2 children, which is 6 people. Since everyone eats one bowl at a meal, they will use 6 bowls for dinner.

The pot can fill 8 child-sized bowls. To find out how many times the children can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to divide the total number of child-sized bowls by the number of bowls used for dinner.

Number of child-sized bowls = 8
Number of bowls used for dinner = 6

Number of times the children can have a bowl of soup for lunch = 8 / 6 = 1.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a bowl, we can round down to 1 time for each child to have a bowl of soup for lunch, and there will be 2/3 of a bowl left over."

"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total time he spends on activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day (24 hours).

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. 
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Total time spent on activities = 10 (sleep) + 8 (work) + 1 (walk) = 19 hours.

Free time = Total hours in a day - Total time spent on activities
Free time = 24 - 19
Free time = 5 hours

"To find out how many red shoeboxes Tim used, we need to calculate 1/3 of 9. 

1/3 of 9 = 9 / 3 = 3

So, Tim used 3 red shoeboxes. 

Now, we know Tim used 3 blue shoeboxes and 3 red shoeboxes. 

Initially, Tim had 7 blue shoeboxes and 9 red shoeboxes. 

After using 3 blue shoeboxes, he has 7 - 3 = 4 blue shoeboxes left.

After using 3 red shoeboxes, he has 9 - 3 = 6 red shoeboxes left.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. 

Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write the equation: 
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
(60 - 8) = 2 * (x - 4)
52 = 2x - 8

Now, let's solve for x:
52 + 8 = 2x
60 = 2x
x = 60 / 2
x = 30

So, Adam's age four years ago was 30. 

Now, we need to find Adam's age in 8 years. 
Adam's current age = x + 4 = 30 + 4 = 34
Adam's age in 8 years = 34 + 8 = 42

"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve each type of sudoku and then convert that to hours to find out how many half-hour intervals there are.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, which is 4 * 45 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's convert the time to hours for both types of sudoku:
- Normal sudoku: 45 minutes / 60 = 0.75 hours
- Extreme sudoku: 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the number of half-hour intervals for each type of sudoku:
- Normal sudoku: 0.75 hours / 0.5 hours = 1.5 intervals
- Extreme sudoku: 3 hours / 0.5 hours = 6 intervals

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we can multiply the number of intervals by 1 (since he drinks 1 bottle per interval):
- Normal sudoku: 1.5 intervals * 1 bottle/interval = 1.5 bottles
- Extreme sudoku: 6 intervals * 1 bottle/interval = 6 bottles

The total number of bottles of water John drinks is the sum of the bottles for each type of sudoku: 1.5 + 6 = 7.5 bottles."

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of bologna pieces thrown at red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, so the total number of bologna pieces thrown at yellow balloons is 3 * y.

The total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58, so we can set up the equation:

40 + 3y = 58

Subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

3y = 18

Divide both sides of the equation by 3:

y = 6

The number of yellow balloons is 6."

"To find out how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. 1 dozen balloons is equal to 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, 12 balloons will cost 12 * $0.5 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the cake and the balloons is $11 + $3 = $14.

The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is $7 * 2 = $14.

The total amount of money spent is $14 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy these items, the total amount of money they had is $28.

"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to find the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea. Since Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, each row will have 27 / 3 = 9 cups.

Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row, the total number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row is 9. 

The total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea is 3 * 9 = 27. 

Since she uses the remaining cups to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea, the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea is 27, and the total number of cups used for cinnamon tea is 15. The total number of cups is 27 + 15 = 42.

However, we already know that Lana has 27 cups. This means that the 15 cups of cinnamon tea are in addition to the 27 cups, which is not possible. This means that the 15 cups of cinnamon tea must be part of the 27 cups. 

Since the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea is 27, and the total number of cups is 27, the 15 cups of cinnamon tea must be part of the 27 cups. This means that the 15 cups of cinnamon tea are the chamomile tea cups in each row, and the mint tea cups are the remaining cups in each row.

The total number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row is 9, and the total number of cinnamon tea cups in each row is 15. However, this is not possible since the total number of cups in each row is 9. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. Since the total number of cups is 27, and the total number of cups of cinnamon tea is 15, the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12. 

Since the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea is 12, and there are 3 rows, the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea in each row is 12 / 3 = 4. 

Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is 4 / 2 = 2."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick per trip. 

Let's denote the number of berries the sloth picks per trip as 'b'. Since the sloth takes 4 hours to make a round trip, in 8 hours, he can make 8/4 = 2 trips. 

Since the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and he makes 2 trips, the total number of berries he picks in 2 trips is 2b. 

We can set up the equation 2b = 24 to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick per trip.

2b = 24
b = 24/2

"To find the amount of water in the tank after 6 days, we need to first find the initial amount of water in the tank. Since Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, the initial amount of water in the tank is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Next, we need to find the total amount of water used from the tank in 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so in 6 days, the total amount of water used is 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank: 5000 - 3000 = 1000 gallons.

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find out how many movies Colby can see, we need to first calculate how much money he has left. 

Colby's monthly budget is $150. He has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Money left: $150 - $130 = $20

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 and he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can see 1 more movie on a Friday or Saturday. 

Now, let's calculate how much money is left for other days: $20 - $10 = $10

Tickets for other days cost $7, so he can see $10 / $7 = 1.4286 (round down to 1 since you can't see a fraction of a movie) more movie on other days.

Total movies Colby can see: 1 (on Friday) + 1 (on other days) = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to first find the calories of a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we can find the total calories of the pastries by multiplying the number of mini cinnamon rolls by their calories and the number of mini blueberry muffins by their calories, then adding the two results together.

Total calories of mini cinnamon rolls = 200 * 200 = 40,000
Total calories of mini blueberry muffins = 150 * 300 = 45,000

Total calories of all pastries = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000

The final answer is: 85000"
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to find the total number of Junebugs removed and divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days = 378 / 5 = 75.6"
"To find out how far each vehicle traveled, we need to multiply their speeds by the time they traveled.

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.

"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and Jean's age as J. 

We are given that Pp = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than Jean) and P = Pp + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age).

We are also given that P + Pp + J = 100 (the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old).

We can substitute Pp from the first equation into the second equation: P = (J + 10) + J.

Simplifying the equation, we get P = 2J + 10.

Now, we can substitute P and Pp into the third equation: (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100.

Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80.

Divide both sides by 4: J = 20.

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age using the first equation: Pp = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.

Finally, we can find Peter's age using the second equation: P = Pp + J = 30 + 20 = 50.

"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria had 1 balloon, and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each. So, the total initial number of balloons is:
1 (Maria's balloon) + 4 * 2 (friends' balloons) = 1 + 8 = 9

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 * 3 = 15

Now, we add the initial number of balloons and the additional balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many tables they need, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so they have 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. 
They already have 10 boxes, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

They can fit 2 boxes per table, so they need 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

They already own 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 more tables.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average total distance spat, we need to find the total distance spat by each person and then divide by the number of seeds they spat.

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both of them is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

They spat a total of 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

The average total distance spat is 820 / 75 = 10.93 (rounded to two decimal places).

"To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then multiply that by the price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine:

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Now, let's find the difference in revenue:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay with the two options and then find the difference.

Option 1: 24-hour stay - 1600 pesos
Option 2: 12-hour stay (1000 pesos) + additional hours

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is 17 hours later. Since the first 12 hours are already included in the 1000 pesos, we need to calculate the cost of the additional 5 hours.

5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay with the additional hours is 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's find the difference between the two options:
Difference = 1600 pesos (24-hour stay) - 1350 pesos (12-hour stay with additional hours)
Difference = 250 pesos

Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing the option of adding 70 pesos for every additional hour after the 12-hour mark.

The final answer is: $250"
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. 
3 pounds less than 10 pounds is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the hay needed for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

"To find out how much John earned, we need to multiply his hourly wage by the number of hours he worked: 
50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spent 50 dollars on gas and wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we need to subtract these amounts from his earnings: 
300 - 50 - 100 = 150 dollars.

He wants to buy 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so we need to multiply the number of pencils by the cost of each pencil: 
5 * 10 = 50 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of the pencils from his remaining money: 
150 - 50 = 100 dollars.

Finally, we need to find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining money:

"To find the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 20 * 15 = 300.

Since Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, we add 50 to the total number of letters Craig spelled: 300 + 50 = 350.

Now, we need to find the number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled. Since Craig's brother has 50 more letters than Craig, and Craig has 300 letters, we can find the number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled by adding 50 to 300: 300 + 50 = 350. However, this is the same as the number of letters Craig spelled. This means that Craig's brother also spelled 20 words with 15 letters each. 

To find the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 20 * 15 = 300.

Now, we add the total number of letters Craig spelled to the total number of letters Craig's brother spelled: 300 + 300 = 600.

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we need to calculate the original price and then subtract the discount. 

Original price of 10 CDs = 10 * $15 = $150
Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60
Price after discount = $150 - $60 = $90

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each, so he made a total of:
5 * $40 = $200

Since he spent $90 and made $200, he made a profit of $200 - $90 = $110.

However, the question asks how much money he was out, which implies he made a loss. Since he made a profit of $110, he was actually out $110."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the time James took to swim 60% of the distance.
Distance = 20 miles, Speed = 2 miles per hour
Time = Distance / Speed = 20 / 2 = 10 hours
60% of the distance is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles
Time taken to swim 12 miles = 12 / 2 = 6 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time James rested on the island.
Time taken to swim 12 miles = 6 hours
Time taken to rest = 6 / 2 = 3 hours

Step 3: Calculate the remaining distance and time taken to swim the remaining distance.
Remaining distance = 20 - 12 = 8 miles
Speed = 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour (since he swims at half the speed)
Time taken to swim the remaining distance = 8 / 1 = 8 hours

Step 4: Calculate the total time taken to get across the lake.
Time taken to swim 12 miles = 6 hours
Time taken to rest = 3 hours
Time taken to swim the remaining distance = 8 hours
Total time = 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours

"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D. 

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. 

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can set these two equations equal to each other: A + 20 = D + 10.

We can simplify this equation by subtracting 10 from both sides: A + 10 = D.

Now we know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. We also know that the total points scored by the team is 45, so A + B + D = 45.

We can substitute B = A + 20 into the equation A + B + D = 45: A + (A + 20) + D = 45.

Combine like terms: 2A + 20 + D = 45.

Now we can substitute A + 10 = D into the equation 2A + 20 + D = 45: 2A + 20 + (A + 10) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3A + 30 = 45.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 3A = 15.

Divide both sides by 3: A = 5.

"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked. He worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. 

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the total number of minutes he worked is:
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know that Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the number of reports he staples per minute, we divide 30 by 15:
30 reports / 15 minutes = 2 reports/minute

Now, we multiply the total number of minutes he worked by the number of reports he staples per minute:
900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports

"To find the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total minutes she slept and subtract the minutes she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. So, her usual sleep duration is 8 hours. 

8 hours = 8 * 60 minutes = 480 minutes

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so her wake-up time is 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

Her actual sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. 

5:55 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 7 hours 55 minutes

7 hours 55 minutes = 7 * 60 minutes + 55 minutes = 455 minutes

Now, we need to subtract the minutes she was sleepwalking from her actual sleep duration. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.

2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes

"To find the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially, we need to first find the number of measuring cups he has. Since he has two dozen cups, we multiply 2 by 12 to get the total number of cups.

2 * 12 = 24 cups

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we multiply the number of cups by 2/3 to find the number of spoons.

24 * (2/3) = 16 spoons

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, we subtract 6 from the initial number of spoons to find the remaining number of spoons.

16 - 6 = 10 spoons

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the remaining spoons and the number of cups.

24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils

"To find the number of occupied beds initially, we multiply the total capacity by the fraction occupied: 
1000 * (1/5) = 200 beds occupied.

Since the hospital has 1000 beds in total, the number of unoccupied beds initially is:
1000 - 200 = 800 beds.

Each day, 50 patients are admitted, so in 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted is:
50 * 14 = 700 patients.

The number of occupied beds after 2 weeks is the initial number of occupied beds plus the number of patients admitted:
200 + 700 = 900 beds.

The number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is the total capacity minus the number of occupied beds:
1000 - 900 = 100 beds.

"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as x. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason carried 2x balls. Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2 * 2x = 4x balls.

We know that the total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them. So, the total number of balls is x + 2x + 4x = 7x.

We are also given that Jason carried 2 balls. Since Jason carried 2x balls, we can set up the equation 2x = 2 and solve for x.

2x = 2
x = 1

Now that we know x = 1, we can find the total number of balls by substituting x into the equation 7x.

Total number of balls = 7x
Total number of balls = 7 * 1
Total number of balls = 7

"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got as x. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so we can set up the equation:

x = 70

Since Collins got x + 15 corn chips, we can set up the equation:

x + 15 = 70 + 15 (since Collins got 15 more than the others)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 15 = 85

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get:

x = 70

This confirms that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each. Now, we need to find the total number of corn chips. We know that Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got:

Total = x + x + (x + 15)
Total = 2x + (x + 15)
Total = 3x + 15
Total = 3(70) + 15

Now, we add this to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel:
Cost of travel = Cost of supplies + 50% of cost of supplies
= $400 + $200
= $600

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L. 

We are given the following information:
1. A + S + L = 339
2. L = S + 5
3. S = 4A - 13

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to get:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the third equation into the above equation:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand the equation:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is: 147"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Each episode is 20 minutes long.
- There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode.

Since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, the number of episodes is 20 / 2 = 10.

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

Distance traveled in the first 10 hours = speed * time = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles

Distance traveled in the last 5 hours = speed * time = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Since the bird traveled 2 hours in the northerly direction, we need to find the distance traveled in that direction. 
Distance traveled in the 2 hours = speed * time = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles

Now, we subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction. 
Total distance traveled in the southerly direction = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles
Distance traveled in the northerly direction = 36 miles
Distance between the bird's northern and southern homes = Total distance traveled in the southerly direction - Distance traveled in the northerly direction = 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies.
She received 1/2 dozen brownies from her office, which is 6 brownies.
She received 4 dozen brownies from her friends, which is 48 brownies.

Total brownies received = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66

1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

Total brownies left over = Total brownies received - brownies eaten
= 66 - 18
= 48

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is the decimal equivalent of 75%): 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members: Nani's age (8) + his brother's age (16) + his sister's age (6) = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time it takes for each type of string and then add them together.

Time for synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
Time for polyester string racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
Time for hybrid racquets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Total time = 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to find the number of players in Zeke's team and add it to the number of players in Carlton's team.

Carlton's team has 13 players. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. 

So, the number of players in Zeke's team = 13 + 7 = 20

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 
Total players = 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given that the length (l) is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(15 + 10)
P = 2(25)
P = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

50 feet * 2 slats/foot = 100 slats

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first determine how many oranges she had initially, then subtract the ones she gave away and kept.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. So, the total number of oranges she bought is 12 * 20 = 240.

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, which is a total of 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 240 = 60 oranges.

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the ones she gave away and kept from the total: 240 - 80 - 60 = 100 oranges.

The final answer is: 100"

The USA has 50 states. 

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. 
Half of 50 is 25. 
4 more than 25 is 29. 

So, India has 29 states. 

The total number of states in both countries together is 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79.

The final answer is: 79"
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

Total cost = cost of dictionary + cost of dinosaur book + cost of children's cookbook
Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8
Total cost = $39

Since Tyler has already saved $14, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn.

Amount needed to earn = Total cost - Amount saved
Amount needed to earn = $39 - $14
Amount needed to earn = $25

Now, we can divide the amount needed to earn by the hourly wage to find out how many hours Tyler needs to work.

Hours to work = Amount needed to earn / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $25 / $5
Hours to work = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard.

Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, we can represent Richard's cherries as 30 - 10 = 20.

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60, and we have the cherries of Robert and Richard. To find Jerry's cherries, we subtract the total cherries of Robert and Richard from the total number of cherries:

Total cherries = 60
Robert's cherries = 30
Richard's cherries = 20
Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - (Robert's cherries + Richard's cherries)
= 60 - (30 + 20)
= 60 - 50
= 10

Now, we need to find how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. We already know Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries.

Difference = Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries
= 30 - 10
= 20

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.
- On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so G = 10.
- On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so A = Sunday's apple pie - 4.
- On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so Sunday's gingerbread = G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.
- On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, we can find the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday. 
Sunday's apple pie = 15
A = Sunday's apple pie - 4
A = 15 - 4
A = 11

Now, we can find the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on Saturday and Sunday.
- Saturday's gingerbread = 10
- Saturday's apple pie = 11
- Sunday's gingerbread = 15
- Sunday's apple pie = 15

Now, we can find the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold over the two days.
- Total gingerbread = 10 + 15 = 25
- Total apple pie = 11 + 15 = 26

Now, we can find the total amount earned from gingerbread and apple pie.
- Total gingerbread cost = 25 * $6 = $150
- Total apple pie cost = 26 * $15 = $390
- Total amount earned = $150 + $390 = $540

"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use.

Pamela will be outside for 4 hours a day for 8 days, so the total number of hours she will be outside is 4 * 8 = 32 hours.

Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour, she will use 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.

Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she will need, we divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces):

32 / 8 = 4

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

Price of blue car = $100
Discount = 40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40

Price of red car = Price of blue car - Discount
= $100 - $40
= $60

So, the price of the red car is $60.

The total cost of both cars is the sum of their prices:
Total cost = Price of blue car + Price of red car
= $100 + $60
= $160

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is 19 years old now.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

From point 3, we can deduce that Emil's brother is currently half of Emil's age when Emil turns 24. Since Emil is 19 now, when he turns 24, he will be 24 - 19 = 5 years older. So, his brother will be 5 / 2 = 2.5 years old when Emil turns 24.

Now, let's find the current age of Emil's brother. Since his brother will be 2.5 years old when Emil turns 24, his current age is 24 - 2.5 = 21.5 years old.

From point 2, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. So, his dad's age when Emil turns 24 will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

Now, let's find the current age of Emil's dad. Since his dad will be 48 years old when Emil turns 24, his current age is 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 43 + 21.5 = 64.5.

"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find the number of students who are football players, we need to calculate 20% of 30. 

20% of 30 = 0.2 * 30 = 6

So, there are 6 football players in the class.

The remaining students are 30 - 6 = 24.

Now, we need to find 25% of the remaining students who are cheerleaders or part of the band.

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

So, there are 6 students who are cheerleaders or part of the band.

The total number of students leaving early is the sum of football players and cheerleaders/band members.

Total students leaving early = 6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders/band members) = 12

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. 

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie's boots are size 5, we can multiply 5 by 5 to find Charlie's boot size.

Charlie's boot size = 5 * 5 = 25

Now, we need to find the average of Sophie's and Charlie's boot sizes. To do this, we add their sizes and divide by 2.

Average size = (Sophie's size + Charlie's size) / 2
Average size = (5 + 25) / 2
Average size = 30 / 2
Average size = 15

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to first convert the width of the flower bed from feet to inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches
111 feet = 111 * 12 = 1332 inches

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant, we need to convert 1.5 feet to inches as well.
1.5 feet = 1.5 * 12 = 18 inches

Now, let's find the total space taken up by the plants and the space between them. We'll call the number of plants 'n'. The total space taken up by the plants and the space between them is 1332 + (n - 1) * 18.

The total space taken up by the plants is 12n (since each plant is 12 inches wide).

We can set up the equation: 12n + (n - 1) * 18 = 1332

Expanding the equation, we get: 12n + 18n - 18 = 1332

Combine like terms: 30n - 18 = 1332

Add 18 to both sides: 30n = 1350

Divide both sides by 30: n = 45

So, Pat can fit 45 plants in her flower bed. However, she already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 45 - 17 = 28 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 28 * 6 = $168.

For 4 sunflowers, each needing 3 pounds of soil, the total soil used is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

For 10 carnations, each needing 1.5 pounds of soil, the total soil used is 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.

The total soil used for sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have a 30-pound bag of soil, the remaining soil for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so the number of roses they can plant is 3 / 1 = 3.

"To find out how much Jessica sets aside each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income. 

25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, we need to find out how much she saves in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply $500.00 by 12.

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so we divide $6,000.00 by $1,000.00.

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: peeling and cooking.

First, let's calculate how long it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we can divide 90 by 6 to get the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp.

90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide 90 by 30 to get the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp, then multiply by 10.

90 / 30 = 3
3 * 10 = 30 minutes

However, since peeling and cooking are done sequentially, we need to add the time it takes to peel and cook.

"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature. 

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

However, the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is not running. Since the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. 
2. The time between two consecutive appearances of the comet is 75 years.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. 
   - Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.
4. The time between the two appearances of the comet is 75 years, so the time between the first appearance and the second appearance is 75 years.
5. Since Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, we can set up an equation to find his age when he saw the comet for the first time:
   - Let x be Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time.
   - x + 75 = 90 (since the time between the two appearances is 75 years)

"Let's break down the information given:

- The first plane flies to Greece for 3/4 of its flights and splits the remaining 1/4 between France and Germany.
- The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes in a day.

Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as 'x'. Since the second plane makes half the number of trips the first plane makes, the second plane also makes x/2 trips.

Since the second plane makes 44 trips, we can set up the equation x/2 = 44. Solving for x, we get x = 88.

Now, we know the first plane makes 88 trips in a day. Since it flies to Greece for 3/4 of its flights, the number of flights to Greece is (3/4) * 88 = 66.

The remaining 1/4 of the flights are split between France and Germany. So, the total number of flights to France and Germany combined is (1/4) * 88 = 22.

Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is half of 22, which is 22 / 2 = 11.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to find the individual howl times and add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the individual howl times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. 

We know that the total age of the children is 20, and Akbar and Alessandro are 3 and 4 years old, respectively. 

So, the total age of Akbar and Alessandro is 3 + 4 = 7. 

The total age of the remaining two children (Helene and Wilfred) is 20 - 7 = 13.

We also know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's denote the average age of the group as A. 

The average age of the group is the total age of the group divided by the number of children, which is 20/4 = 5.

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, Helene's age is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we know that the total age of Helene and Wilfred is 13, and Helene is 10 years old. 

So, Wilfred's age is 13 - 10 = 3.

"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 

Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend donates $200, but this is not included in the amount that the lawyer will multiply by 3. The lawyer will only consider the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund.

So, the amount the lawyer will multiply by 3 = $2000

The lawyer will donate 3 times this amount, which is 3 * $2000 = $6000

"To find the total number of cookies, we multiply the number of guests by the number of cookies each guest brought. 

Total cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

Since the bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church, we need to find 1/2 of 1500 cookies.

1/2 of 1500 cookies = 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got.

Number of people in the church = 750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices the adults get is 2 * 2 = 4 slices, and the total number of slices the kids get is 4 slices.

The total number of slices is 4 (adults) + 4 (kids) = 8 slices.

The adults get 4 out of 8 slices, which is 4/8 = 0.5 or 50% of the total watermelon.

The percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is 50%."
"To find the total time spent on rounds, we need to multiply the number of inpatients by the time spent per inpatient. 

Time spent on rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time spent on rounds to hours by dividing by 60.

Time spent on rounds (in hours) = 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

To find the total time spent on appointments, we multiply the number of appointments by the time spent per appointment.

Time spent on appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes

Converting the time spent on appointments to hours:

Time spent on appointments (in hours) = 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

Total time spent at the clinic = Time spent on rounds + Time spent on appointments
Total time spent at the clinic = 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours

Since Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours to find the time left to update his records.

Time left to update records = 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:
180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Jordan needs to start making the cake 3 hours before 5:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm. 

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

The final answer is: $\boxed{2:00 pm}$"
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We are given that they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation: 
8x = 64

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

The number of chocolate bars in a box is 8."
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. So, the number of sessions in a month is 3 sessions/day * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

The total cost per session is $40, and there are 12 sessions in a month. So, the total cost per month is $40 * 12 = $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as 'x'. Since Peter has 4 boxes, the total number of chocolate bars he has is 4x. We are given that this total is 64, so we can write the equation:

4x = 64

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 64 / 4
x = 16

Now, let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as 'y'. Since Martha has 7 boxes, the total number of chocolate bars she has is 7y. We are given that this total is 56, so we can write the equation:

7y = 56

To find the value of 'y', we divide both sides of the equation by 7:

y = 56 / 7
y = 8

Now that we know the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes, we can find the difference:

Difference = x - y
= 16 - 8
= 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5.

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of babies born in a month is 30 * 4 = 120.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the initial population plus the number of babies born in a year.

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed them to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need, we need to do that next.

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon.

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

The final answer is: $826"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to find the number of blue and yellow sticks first.

We know that there are 9 red sticks, and 5 more blue sticks than red. So, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the distance traveled by Matteo, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.

To find the distance traveled by Shandy, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.

Now, we subtract the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy to find the difference: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we need to first find the number of students over 16 and under 16, and then find the number of female students in each group.

Number of students over 16: 3000 * 0.5 = 1500
Number of male students over 16: 1500 * 0.25 = 375
Number of female students over 16: 1500 - 375 = 1125

Number of students under 16: 3000 * 0.5 = 1500
Number of male students under 16: 1500 * 0.5 = 750
Number of female students under 16: 1500 - 750 = 750

Total number of female students: 1125 + 750 = 1875"
"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to calculate their individual lap counts.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to subtract Quinn's lap count from Bethany's lap count: 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is (1/4) * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped (3/4) * 4500 = 3375 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is (2/3) * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is (1/3) * 3375 = 1125 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons. To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we subtract this from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x.

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is 100% - 9% * 5 = 55% of the initial charge.

Now, for the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining is 55% - 7% * 3 = 55% - 21% = 34% of the initial charge.

However, we are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. This means that 34% is 28% after the last 3 hours. To find the charge before the last 3 hours, we need to set up an equation:

34% of the initial charge = 28% of the charge after 5 hours

Let's convert the percentages to decimals for easier calculation:
0.34x = 0.28(0.91x)

where 0.91x is the charge after 5 hours (100% - 9% = 91%)

Now, let's solve for x:
0.34x = 0.28 * 0.91x
0.34x = 0.2548x
0.34x - 0.2548x = 0
0.0852x = 0

"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and her hourly tips are $15. So, her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Next, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of the car, which is 20% of $10,000. 

20% of $10,000 is 0.20 * $10,000 = $2000.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Janet to save $2000. We can do this by dividing the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000).

$2000 / $1000 = 2.

So, Janet will need to work 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate how much money he has left after purchasing the other fruits. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he has already purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy:

$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. 

Anne kept 2 packs, so she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Since she gave the packs equally to 10 friends, each friend received 13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are in 1.3 packs. Since each pack has 60 pieces, we multiply 1.3 packs by 60 pieces per pack.

1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces.

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Olivia uploaded 72 pictures in total.
- She put the same number of pictures into 8 albums.
- 3 albums were selfies only.
- 2 albums were portraits.

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8 to find out how many pictures were in each album.

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Since 3 albums were selfies only, the total number of selfies is 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies.

The remaining albums are portraits, which is 8 albums - 3 selfies albums - 2 portrait albums = 3 albums. 
Since each album has 9 pictures, the total number of portraits is 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 portraits.

The total number of portraits and selfies is 27 portraits + 27 selfies = 54."
"To find the total time James spends reading, we need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read 18 pages and then add that to the time it takes him to read the first 3 pages.

First, let's find out how many minutes it takes James to read 1 page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can divide 10 by 3 to get the time per page:

10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, let's multiply the time per page by the total number of pages James reads:

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

Since James also reads the first 3 pages, we need to add the time it takes him to read those pages:

60 minutes + 10 minutes = 70 minutes

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, there were 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests checked out late, so the number of guests remaining is 76 - 15 = 61.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30.

So, the number of guests remaining is 61 + 30 = 91.

After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The final answer is: 98"

"To find the number of points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of questions in each category and then find the number of questions Aries is sure to get in each category.

First, let's find the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:
- Total questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24
- Average and difficult questions: 60 - 24 = 36
- Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, we have: 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Now, let's find the number of questions Aries is sure to get in each category:
- Easy questions: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18
- Average questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9
- Difficult questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9

Now, let's add up the number of questions Aries is sure to get:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 's' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'l'. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so s = 2l.

2. The price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one, so the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * 4 = $12.

3. The total earnings from the sales are $120. The total earnings can be calculated as the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals: 4s + 12l = 120.

4. Since s = 2l, we can substitute this into the equation from step 3: 4(2l) + 12l = 120.

5. Simplifying the equation, we get 8l + 12l = 120, which is 20l = 120.

6. To find the value of l, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: l = 120 / 20 = 6.

7. Since s = 2l, we can find the value of s by multiplying l by 2: s = 2 * 6 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 2 * 12 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Next, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. Since he can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 24 + (0.5 * 24) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. Since one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days with steel pickaxes. Since they can mine 1440 pounds of ore per day, they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore in 30 days.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The ratio for the first package is 3/2, and for the second package is 6/4. We can simplify these ratios to 3/2 and 3/2, which means the price increases by a factor of 1.5 for each additional sandwich.

Since the first package has 2 sandwiches and the second package has 4 sandwiches, the price of the second package is 1.5 times the price of the first package. 

Given that the second package costs $6, we can set up the equation: 3 * 1.5 = 6. This confirms that the price increase is correct.

Now, we need to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches. Since the price increases by a factor of 1.5 for each additional sandwich, we can multiply the price of the second package by 1.5 twice to get the price of the package with 8 sandwiches.

6 * 1.5 = 9
9 * 1.5 = 13.5

The price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $13.50."
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to subtract the amount he paid from the total cost of the bedroom set.

First, let's find out how much Tom still owes after selling his old bedroom set:

Total cost of bedroom set: $3000
Amount paid from selling old bedroom: $1000
Amount still owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Now, we need to find out how much Tom has to pay per month. The interest rate is 10% per month, which is a monthly interest rate. To find the monthly payment, we can use the formula:

Monthly payment = Amount still owed x Monthly interest rate

Monthly interest rate = 10% = 0.10
Monthly payment = $2000 x 0.10 = $200

"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 
40% of 25 is 0.4 * 25 = 10. 
So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. 
Half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6. 
So, 6 yellow balloons were released, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. 
So, 6 blue balloons were added to her clutch.

Now, we need to add the remaining balloons: 15 red, 6 yellow, and 6 blue. 
15 + 6 + 6 = 27.

The final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 27."
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher is present and doesn't collect homework (50% chance). 
2. The normal teacher is present and gives everyone an extension (40% chance). 
3. The normal teacher is present, doesn't give an extension to the whole class, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance).

However, the third scenario is dependent on the second scenario not happening, so we need to find the probability of the normal teacher being present and not giving an extension, which is 60% (100% - 40%). 

Now, we can multiply the probabilities of the first and third scenarios: 50% * 20% = 10%. 

The probability of the second scenario is 40%. 

The total probability of not having to turn in homework is the sum of the probabilities of the first and second scenarios: 50% + 40% = 90%. 

The probability of having to turn in homework is 100% - 90% = 10%.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and not working while in school.

The total amount of loans Jim took is 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000.

The amount of money Jim lost by not working while in school is 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000.

The total amount of money Jim needs to earn is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After college, Jim's income triples, so his new income is $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

To find out how long it will take Jim to earn the total amount of $300,000, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

So, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85.
17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday is 85 + 17 = 102.
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204.
5 more than twice as many as Tuesday is 204 + 5 = 209.
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

"Let's denote the share of the first person as x.

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms:

"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

First, let's convert 3 weeks to days: 3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to find the fraction of a day in hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 of a day is (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

Combine like terms:

(2x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2(2x + 4) + x = 38

Expand the equation:

4x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4

"To find the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to find the total number of tiles required and multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, we need to find the area of one tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of one tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Next, we need to find the total number of tiles required to cover the kitchen floor. We can do this by dividing the total area of the kitchen floor (200 SqFt) by the area of one tile (1 SqFt).

Total number of tiles = Total area of kitchen floor / Area of one tile
= 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt
= 200

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile.

Total cost = Total number of tiles * Cost of each tile

"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since a twin bed has 1 set of sheets and a king size bed has 1 set of sheets, the total number of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 + 1 = 5.

Since he can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 1, which is 2. This means he can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time.

However, since he has 5 sets of sheets, he will need to wash 3 sets of sheets (2 twin sets and 1 king set) in 2 loads, and then 1 more twin set in a third load. So, he does 3 loads of laundry per week.

To find out how many loads of laundry he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads he does per week by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year.

3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and multiply it by 4.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies. 
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

To find the total number of movies they watch in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of movies they watch in one weekend by 4:
6 * 4 = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to add the stickers he had two years ago, the stickers he collected last year, and the stickers he collected this year.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.
This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.
So, this year, Leo has 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

Now, we add the stickers from two years ago, last year, and this year: 100 + 150 + 250 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount of cat food each cat eats per day (60 grams * 2 times a day).

First, let's calculate the total amount of cat food each cat eats per day: 60 grams * 2 = 120 grams per day.

Now, let's divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount each cat eats per day (120 grams): 720 / 120 = 6.

So, the cat food will last for 6 days."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 4 pizzas with 8 slices each, so the total number of slices is 4 * 8 = 32.
2. Becky ate 10 slices.
3. Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake did, so Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.
4. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake did, so Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, let's add up the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:
10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31

The final answer is: 31"
"Let's denote the time Donovan took as x. Since Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, Betsy's time can be represented as x + 18.

The total time taken by both of them is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 18) = 98.

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98.

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Since x is Donovan's time, and Betsy's time is x + 18, Betsy's time is 40 + 18 = 58.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them up.

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The cost of the 30-minute visit is $300/hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of 30 painkillers at $4/pill is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of parking is $6/hour for a minimum of 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

"To find out how many emails James responds to, we first need to find out how many emails he doesn't respond to. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the rest, which is 80 - 16 = 64 emails per day.

In a 5-day work week, James responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails. 

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day:

The average score is 95."
"To find the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team, and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 
They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 (by the glee club) + 32 (by the football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 (by the glee club) + 40 (by the football team) = 60 pizzas.

The number of pizzas left is 60 (total pizzas) - 46 (pizzas eaten) = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 = 3500 cents.

He wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, so he will send out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 = 21000 cents.

The total cost of postage is the sum of the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons: 3500 + 21000 = 24300 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24300 / 100 = 243 dollars.

The final answer is: $243"
"To find out how many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained, we need to follow the steps:

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. 
   So, Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

2. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. 
   So, Sidney had 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches left.

3. Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches. 
   So, now Sidney has 3 + 3 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches.

4. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 
   So, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to find the number of trucks that did not have mechanical failures. 

Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we can find the number of trucks that failed by dividing the total number of trucks by 4.

Number of trucks that failed = Total number of trucks / 4
= 20 / 4
= 5

Now, we can find the number of trucks that did not have mechanical failures by subtracting the number of failed trucks from the total number of trucks.

Number of trucks that did not fail = Total number of trucks - Number of trucks that failed
= 20 - 5
= 15

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, we can find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers by multiplying the number of trucks that did not fail by the tons of fertiliser each truck was carrying.

Total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers = Number of trucks that did not fail * Tons of fertiliser per truck
= 15 * 20
= 300

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total cost of the butter, we need to calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter with the promotion.

Since Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion is buy one pound of butter get one half off, which means that for every 2 pounds of butter, he will pay the full price of 1 pound. 

So, for 6 pounds of butter, he will pay for 3 pounds at the full price and 3 pounds at half the price.

The cost of 3 pounds at the full price is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00.

The cost of 3 pounds at half the price is 3 * ($4.00 / 2) = 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.

The total cost of 6 pounds of butter is $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00.

The final answer is: $18.00"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume Maggie and Riza each had x dollars initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, so she spent 1/4x dollars. This means she has 3/4x dollars left.

Riza spent one-third of her money, so she spent 1/3x dollars. This means she has 2/3x dollars left.

Since they each have $60 left, we can set up the following equations:

3/4x = 60
2/3x = 60

We can solve for x by multiplying both sides of each equation by the reciprocal of the fraction:

(4/3)x = 60 => x = 60 * (3/4) = 45
(3/2)x = 60 => x = 60 * (2/3) = 40

However, the initial amount of money they had should be the same for both of them. So, we can equate the two values of x:

45 = 40

This is a contradiction, which means our initial assumption that they each had x dollars is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Let's assume they each had y dollars initially. Then, Maggie spent 1/4y dollars, so she has 3/4y dollars left. Riza spent 1/3y dollars, so she has 2/3y dollars left.

Since they each have $60 left, we can set up the following equations:

3/4y = 60
2/3y = 60

We can solve for y by multiplying both sides of each equation by the reciprocal of the fraction:

(4/3)y = 60 => y = 60 * (3/4) = 45
(3/2)y = 60 => y = 60 * (2/3) = 40

However, the initial amount of money they had should be the same for both of them. So, we can equate the two values of y:

45 = 40

This is still a contradiction. Let's try another approach.

Let's assume they each had y dollars initially. Then, Maggie spent 1/4y dollars, so she has 3/4y dollars left. Riza spent 1/3y dollars, so she has 2/3y dollars left.

Since they each have $60 left, we can set up the following equation:

3/4y + 2/3y = 120

To add the fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 12. So, we can rewrite the equation as:

9y/12 + 8y/12 = 120

Combine the fractions:

17y/12 = 120

Multiply both sides by 12:

17y = 1440

Divide both sides by 17:

y = 1440/17
y = 84.71 (approximately)

Now that we have the initial amount of money they had, we can find the total amount of money they have left:

Total money left = (3/4)y + (2/3)y
= (9y/12) + (8y/12)
= (17y/12)
= (17 * 84.71)/12
= 119.19

However, this is not the final answer. We need to find the total amount of money they have left in terms of dollars, not in terms of the initial amount of money they had.

Since they each had $60 left, the total amount of money they have left is:

Total money left = 60 + 60
= 120

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total bananas = 315
- First monkey eats 10 bananas per day
- Second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day
- The third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we need to find out how many bananas are left after the first two monkeys eat their share. 

First, let's find out how many bananas the first two monkeys eat in a day: 
10 (first monkey) + 14 (second monkey) = 24 bananas

Now, subtract the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total bananas to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats: 
315 (total bananas) - 24 (bananas eaten by first two monkeys) = 291 bananas

So, the third monkey eats 291 bananas per day."

"To find out how much Jenny paid for the roses, we need to determine if she bought the roses by the dozen or individually. 

Since she bought 15 roses, and a dozen is 12, she bought 1 dozen and 3 individual roses. 

1 dozen roses cost $15, and 3 individual roses cost 3 * $2 = $6. 

So, the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the change is $4 and they only have quarters for change, we need to find out how many quarters make up $4. 

There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

"To find the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time Paul needs to wait for his train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, we need to find the time Paul needs to wait for his train. Since the current time is not given, we assume it is 0 minutes. Paul needs to wait until the fourth train arrives, which is at 145 minutes. So, the total waiting time for Paul is 145 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks Melanie needs to save toothpicks, we first need to determine how many toothpicks she has saved so far. 

Melanie saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. 
So, the total number of toothpicks she saved is 10 * 12 = 120.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total and she already has 120, she needs 200 - 120 = 80 more toothpicks.

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks, we divide 80 by 10. 
80 / 10 = 8.

Therefore, Melanie needs 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is:

2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so the price his friend paid is:

1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price his friend paid, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100:

Discount = ((2000 - 1800) / 2000) * 100
Discount = (200 / 2000) * 100
Discount = 0.10 * 100
Discount = 10%

"To find the total cost of buying bananas individually, we need to calculate the total number of bananas and multiply it by the cost per banana. 

Since Jenny buys 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, the total number of bananas is 10 * 4 = 40.

The cost per banana is $0.80. So, the total cost of buying 40 bananas individually is 40 * $0.80 = $32.

The total cost of buying 10 bunches is 10 * $3.00 = $30.

To find the amount saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32 - $30 = $2.

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

The amount of fence left over for Sam is 20 feet.

"To find the total earnings, we need to find the number of each type of bike sold and multiply it by its price.

Let's start by finding the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's find the total earnings for each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the total earnings:

"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we first need to find the total minutes he spends in a day. 

There are 6 periods in a day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes in a day is 6 * 40 = 240 minutes.

Since John goes to class for 5 days a week, the total minutes he spends in class in a week is 240 * 5 = 1200 minutes.

Next, we need to find the total minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these two days. 

First, we need to find the total minutes in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total minutes in a week is 240 * 7 = 1680 minutes.

1/16 of 1680 minutes is (1/16) * 1680 = 105 minutes.

Now, we add the minutes he spends in class and the minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. 1200 + 105 = 1305 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 1305 / 60 = 21.75 hours.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which is half of what was left after the velociraptors ate.
2. So, the velociraptors ate half of the remaining meat, and the Allosaurus ate the other half. This means the Allosaurus ate half of the meat that the velociraptors ate, and the velociraptors ate half of the meat that the T-Rex ate.
3. Let's call the original amount of meat on the triceratops ""x"". The T-Rex ate half of it, so the T-Rex ate x/2 kilograms of meat.
4. The velociraptors ate half of what was left, which is (x - x/2) = x/2 kilograms of meat.
5. Since the Allosaurus ate half of what the velociraptors ate, the Allosaurus ate (x/2)/2 = x/4 kilograms of meat.
6. We know that the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat, so x/4 = 270.
7. To find the original amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to solve for x: x = 270 * 4 = 1080.

The final answer is: 1080"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint to find out how many gallons are needed. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet. 
The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet. 
The total area of the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so 3 were shaken and 9 were unshaken. Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 1 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 7 sodas in total, with 1 shaken and 6 unshaken. The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans.

Probability = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of cans)
Probability = 1 / 7

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Probability = (1 / 7) * 100
Probability = 14.29%

The final answer is: 14.29"
"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to find the distance each train has traveled and add them together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

The total distance between the two trains is the sum of the distances they have traveled, which is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of days Billy helps, we first need to find the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

However, Billy takes 20% of these days off. 20% of 50 is 0.2 * 50 = 10. So, he takes 10 days off.

The number of days he helps is 50 - 10 = 40.

Since Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

The total number of people he helps is 40 * 6 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people that were present.

First, let's calculate the total number of people that were transported by the buses:
12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people that were transported by the cars:
20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the number of people transported from the total number of people present. However, the question does not provide the total number of people present. 

But, we can assume that the total number of people present is the sum of the people transported by the buses and the cars and the people inside the church. 

Let's denote the number of people inside the church as x. Then, the total number of people present is x + 480.

However, the question does not provide any information about the total number of people present. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of people inside the church.

But, if we assume that the total number of people present is the sum of the people transported by the buses and the cars, then the number of people inside the church is 0.

However, if we assume that the total number of people present is the sum of the people transported by the buses and the cars and some other people, then we cannot determine the exact number of people inside the church.

But, if we assume that the total number of people present is the sum of the people transported by the buses and the cars and the people that were not transported, then we can assume that the number of people not transported is 0.

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is 0."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike.
3. Mike is 24 years old.

From point 2, we know that Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so we can calculate Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age:
Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

From point 1, we know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so we can calculate Jeff's age by adding 10 to Martha's age:
Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of each slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: time = length / speed = 300 / 60 = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide: time = length / speed = 240 / 80 = 3 minutes

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the two slides: 
time difference = time for biggest slide - time for second biggest slide = 5 - 3 = 2 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total time spent on lunches and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. 
Total time spent per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 2 x 15 minutes (breaks) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

Now, we multiply the time spent per day by 5 to find the total time spent in 5 days.
1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours.

The total time spent on lunches and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours."
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total miles run by all three is 52. We can subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after returning the $15.00 item and then add that to the initial charge minus the returned item.

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. Return: -$15.00 (since she returned an item)
   New balance after return: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

3. Frying pan: 20% off $20.00
   Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
   Price of frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

4. Towels: 10% off $30.00
   Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
   Price of towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

5. Total cost of new purchases: $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

6. New balance on credit card: $70.00 (previous balance) + $43.00 (new purchases) = $113.00

The final answer is: $113.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. A fifth of the jellyfish are large.
2. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
3. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue.
4. When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.

From point 2, we know that 1/3 of the large jellyfish change color. This means 2/3 of the large jellyfish do not change color. Since the jellyfish that do not change color are small, we can conclude that 2/3 of the large jellyfish are small.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. Then, the number of large jellyfish is x/5, and the number of small jellyfish is 4x/5 (since 4/5 of the jellyfish are small).

We know that 2/3 of the large jellyfish are small, so we can set up the equation:

(2/3)(x/5) = 4x/5

Simplifying the equation:

(2x/15) = 4x/5

Multiplying both sides by 15 to eliminate the fraction:

2x = 12x

Subtracting 12x from both sides:

-10x = 0

Dividing both sides by -10:

x = 0

However, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as it implies there are no jellyfish in the tank. Let's re-examine the problem.

From point 4, we know that 6 jellyfish changed color. Since these jellyfish are a third of the large jellyfish, we can set up the equation:

(1/3)(x/5) = 6

Simplifying the equation:

x/15 = 6

Multiplying both sides by 15:

x = 90

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Chris is 4 years old.
2. Ben is two times older than Chris, so Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age = 2 * 4 = 8.
3. Caroline is three times older than Ben, so Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age = 3 * 8 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for her retirement. 

First, let's calculate her annual savings. Since she saves 20% of her current annual salary, her annual savings will be 0.2 * $100,000 = $20,000.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save for her retirement. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, her annual expenses in retirement will be 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000. 

The total amount she needs to save for her retirement is the present value of her annual expenses over 20 years. We can use the formula for the present value of an annuity to calculate this:

PV = P * [(1 - (1 + r)^(-n)) / r]

where PV is the present value, P is the annual payment, r is the interest rate, and n is the number of years.

However, since we don't know the interest rate, we will assume a 4% interest rate, which is a common rate for retirement savings. 

PV = $40,000 * [(1 - (1 + 0.04)^(-20)) / 0.04]
PV ≈ $40,000 * 10.61
PV ≈ $424,400

Now, we need to calculate how many years it will take for Lauren to save this amount. We can use the formula for the future value of an annuity to calculate this:

FV = P * [(1 - (1 + r)^(-n)) / r]

We know the future value (FV), the annual payment (P), and the interest rate (r). We need to solve for n.

424,400 = 20,000 * [(1 - (1 + 0.04)^(-n)) / 0.04]

To solve for n, we can rearrange the formula and use logarithms:

(424,400 / 20,000) / (1 / 0.04) = 1 - (1 + 0.04)^(-n)
21.22 = 1 - (1.04)^(-n)
(1.04)^(-n) = 1 - 21.22
(1.04)^(-n) = -20.22
(1.04)^n = 1 / -20.22
(1.04)^n = -0.0495
n = log(1.04)^n / log(-0.0495) / log(1.04)
n ≈ 14.35

However, this is the number of years it will take to save the amount needed for retirement, not the number of years she needs to work. Since she already has 20 years of retirement planned, we need to subtract this from the total number of years:

14.35 - 20 ≈ -5.65

Since we can't have a negative number of years, this means that Lauren will have enough money to cover her retirement expenses after 5.65 years of working. However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We are looking for how many more years she needs to work.

The correct answer is the number of years she needs to work minus the number of years she has already worked. However, we are not given the number of years she has already worked. 

To solve this problem, we need to know the number of years she has already worked. However, since we are not given this information, we will assume that she has worked for 0 years.

The final answer is: 14.35"
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to first divide the total length of the ribbon by 4 to get the length of each of the initial cuts.

Then, we need to divide the length of each initial cut by 5 to get the length of each final cut.

25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total population of the school, we can use the information given about the boys. 

Let's denote the total population as 'x'. Since 40% of the population is made up of boys, we can set up the equation:

40% of x = 240

To convert the percentage to a decimal, we divide by 100:

0.4x = 240

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total population of the school is 600.

Now, we know that 40% of the population is boys, and the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we can calculate 60% of the total population:

Number of girls = 60% of 600
= 0.6 * 600

The total height of the heels for the women wearing 2 inch heels is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

The average height of heels at the party is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

To find out how many days it will take her to hike 9,300 miles, we divide the total miles by the miles per day: 9,300 / 250 = 37.2 days.

Since Soledad only has 30 days in June, she will not be able to complete her journey on time. To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we need to calculate the total miles she needs to hike per day to complete her journey in 30 days.

The total miles she needs to hike per day is 9,300 / 30 = 310 miles per day.

Since she is currently hiking 250 miles per day, she needs to hike 310 - 250 = 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"To find the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers, we need to calculate the production rate of each group and then add them together.

2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, so their combined production rate is 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour.
2 workers produce 4 toys an hour, so their combined production rate is 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour.
The total production rate of the first 4 workers is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since they work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, and the total order is 400 toys. This means that the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys.

The fifth worker works for 10 hours, so the number of toys per hour produced by the fifth worker is 180 / 10 = 18.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. This means Luis has half of Seth's stickers, and Seth has half of his stickers left.
2. Luis used half of the stickers he received and gave the rest to Kris. This means Kris has half of the stickers Luis received, and Luis has half of the stickers he received.
3. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. This means Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.

Now, let's work backwards to find out how many stickers Seth had in the beginning. We know Kris had 16 stickers, and that's half of what Luis had. So, Luis had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers.

Since Luis had 32 stickers, and that's half of what Seth had, Seth had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers in the beginning.

"To find the total number of M&M's, we need to multiply the number of large bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply by the number of M&M's per ounce. 

Total M&M's = 3 large bags * 10 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce
Total M&M's = 3 * 10 * 30
Total M&M's = 900

Since each small bag contains 10 M&M's, we can find the total number of small bags by dividing the total number of M&M's by 10.

Total small bags = Total M&M's / 10
Total small bags = 900 / 10
Total small bags = 90

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Liam's current age as L and Vince's current age as V.

We know that Liam is 16 years old now, so L = 16.

Two years ago, Liam's age was L - 2 = 16 - 2 = 14.

We are also given that two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. So, we can set up the equation:

L - 2 = 2(V - 2)

Substituting L = 16 into the equation, we get:

14 = 2(V - 2)

Expanding the equation, we get:

14 = 2V - 4

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get:

18 = 2V

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:

V = 9

So, Vince is 9 years old now.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

We know that A = M (since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs).

We also know that C + S = 30 (since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs).

Additionally, we know that C = S + 12 (since Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah).

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to get C + S = 30, and then substitute C = S + 12 into this equation to get S + 12 + S = 30.

Combine like terms to get 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtract 12 from both sides to get 2S = 18.

Divide both sides by 2 to get S = 9.

Now that we know S = 9, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12 to get C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, and we know that A + M + C + S = 56, we can substitute A = M and C = 21 and S = 9 into this equation to get M + M + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combine like terms to get 2M + 30 = 56.

Subtract 30 from both sides to get 2M = 26.

Divide both sides by 2 to get M = 13.

Now that we know M = 13, we can find A by substituting M into the equation A = M to get A = 13.

Now that we know A = 13 and C = 21, we can find the difference between C and A by subtracting A from C to get C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to find the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes, then add them together.

First, let's find the total weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 200 crayons, we need to find out how many boxes he will need. To do this, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Now, we can find the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, we add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to calculate 80% of 80 feet. 

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet long, we need to divide the total length of the usable tree by the length of each log.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks, so we multiply the number of logs by 5.

16 * 5 = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 * 1.2 = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Valerie earns $5000 per month.
2. Valerie's brother earns 2 times what Valerie earns, so her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.
3. Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.
4. Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so their mother earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.
5. To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

The time spent on the beach is 40 minutes, and the distance covered on the beach is 2 miles. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed to find the speed on the beach.

Time on the beach = 2 miles / x miles/minute = 40 minutes
x = 2 miles / 40 minutes
x = 1/20 miles/minute

Now that we know the speed on the beach, we can find the speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles/minute.

The time spent on the sidewalk is 1 mile / (1/10 miles/minute) = 10 minutes.

The total time spent on the entire walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk: 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is:
$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60:
$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree.

3 trees had 7 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 3 x 7 = 21.

2 trees had 4 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 2 x 4 = 8.

1 tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the number of blue birds in all the trees: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the number of marbles Bob initially has be x.

If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24. 

So, the equation becomes: x + 24 = 60

To find the initial number of marbles Bob has, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles.

If he loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle. 

Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the temperatures of the two mugs. 

The amount of water from the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces, and the amount of water from the second bottle is 1 ounce. 

The total amount of water in the bottle is 5 ounces. 

The average temperature of the water in the bottle is (33 * 4 + x * 1) / 5.

Since Donny can drink the water, the average temperature must be at least 40 degrees.

We can set up the inequality:

(33 * 4 + x * 1) / 5 ≥ 40

Multiply both sides by 5:

33 * 4 + x * 1 ≥ 40 * 5

132 + x ≥ 200

Subtract 132 from both sides:

x ≥ 68

The second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows

Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
= 470 cows + 230 chickens
= 700 animals

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the original price and then apply the 10% discount.

Original price for 4 packs = 4 packs * $10.00/pack = $40.00

The 10% discount on $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

Discounted price for 4 packs = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Now, we need to find the total number of bagels in 4 packs. 
Total number of bagels = 4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the discounted price by the total number of bagels.
Cost per bagel = $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate, we first need to determine how many scoops 1 less than 3 scoops is. 

1 less than 3 scoops is 3 - 1 = 2 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, so it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops.

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, Gomer ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 18 scoops. We can do this by dividing 18 by 2 and then multiplying by 3. 

18 / 2 = 9
9 * 3 = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens:
240 eggs / 12 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first find the total number of green and red jellybeans. 

There are 17 green jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

The total number of green and red jellybeans is 17 + 34 = 51.

Since there are a total of 60 jellybeans, the number of blue jellybeans is 60 - 51 = 9.

First, let's find the total number of lemons he gets in a year:
5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

Now, let's multiply the number of lemons he gets in a year by 10 to find the total number of lemons in a decade:
30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

Given that the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can let the number of men be 5x and the number of women be 9x. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation: 5x + 9x = 84

Combine like terms: 14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14: x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of women on the bus initially: 9x = 9 * 6 = 54

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women who remained is: 54 - 20 = 34

"Let's break down the information given:

- The cost of a sunflower is $2.
- The cost of a bouquet is $8, which contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers per day.
- Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day.

First, let's find out how many bouquets Faraday sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 from bouquets per day, we can set up the equation:

8x = 56
x = 56 / 8
x = 7

So, Faraday sold 7 bouquets per day.

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in 7 bouquets is:
7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers per day.

Now, let's find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold per day. We know he earned $26 from sunflowers per day and each sunflower costs $2. We can set up the equation:

2x = 26
x = 26 / 2
x = 13

So, Faraday sold 13 sunflowers per day.

Now, let's find the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold in 3 days:
13 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 39 sunflowers

"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference between the two.

First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide $100 by $5:

100 / 5 = 20 rocks

Now, Adam sells 60% of his inventory, which is 60% of 20 rocks:

60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

Since Adam sells each rock for $7, the total revenue from selling 12 rocks is:

12 * 7 = $84

The total cost of buying 20 rocks is:

20 * 5 = $100

Now, let's find the difference between the total revenue and the total cost:

Total revenue: $84
Total cost: $100
Loss: $100 - $84 = $16

"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children.

Since Chatty prepared three dozen eggs, we first need to convert the dozen to a numerical value. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so three dozen eggs would be 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs (36) by the number of children (4):

36 ÷ 4 = 9

Each child receives 9 eggs."
"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total cost of food for one day and then multiply it by the number of days in May.

There are 31 days in May. Each fish needs $1 worth of food per day. Since Jen has 3 fish, the total cost of food per day is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

The final answer is: $93"
"To find out how many roses Patricia has now, we need to subtract the roses she gave away from the initial number of roses and then add the roses she bought.

Initial number of roses: 30
Roses given away: 24

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning.

The probability of the first ticket winning is 20% or 0.2.
The probability of the second ticket winning is three times more likely, so it's 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability of both tickets winning, we multiply the probabilities: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. 
   Let's denote the number of seashells Carlos collected as C. Then, Jim collected C + 5 seashells.
   Since Jim collected 27 seashells, we can write the equation: C + 5 = 27.
   Solving for C, we get C = 22.

2. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. 
   Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as x. Then, Carlos collected 2x seashells.
   We already know that Carlos collected 22 seashells, so we can write the equation: 2x = 22.
   Solving for x, we get x = 11.

Now we know that Carrey collected 11 seashells, Carlos collected 22 seashells, and Jim collected 27 seashells.

They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. 
The total number of seashells is 11 + 22 + 27 = 60.
To find out how many seashells each person got, we divide the total number of seashells by 3 (the number of people):
60 / 3 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). 
So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. 
So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week.
Total carrots eaten in a week = 20 (weekdays) + 10 (weekend) = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to find the length of the second song first. 

The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (which is the decimal form of 60%).

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we have the lengths of both songs: 5 minutes for the first song and 8 minutes for the second song. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the profit from each device and then multiply it by the total number of devices sold.

The cost price of one device is $20, and the selling price is twice the cost price, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

The profit from one device is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $40 - $20 = $20.

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, so the total number of devices sold is 2 + 4 = 6.

The total profit is the profit from one device multiplied by the total number of devices sold, which is $20 * 6 = $120.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of one person.

Since each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, Hortex would need 100% / 20% = 5 times as many bottles.

Now, we need to find out how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. Since one person needs 5 bottles, 2300 people would need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the number of bottles it can produce from the number of bottles needed: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

The final answer is: 7300"

"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, and then subtract that result from the total number of reports received during the week.

Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 1907 + 2136 = 4043

Total reports received during the week = 5168

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received during the week - Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday

"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. 

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters.

The total amount of land sold so far is 40 + 20 = 60 square meters. This leaves him with 80 - 60 = 20 square meters of land.

He then sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned from the first two sales. He earned $50 from the first sale and $30 from the second sale, for a total of $50 + $30 = $80.

Finally, we add the amount of money he earned from the first two sales to the amount he earned from the last sale: $80 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"

"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to first find out how many face masks he uses in a day. 

Since Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, the total number of face masks he uses in a day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2. 

6 * 2 = 12

"To find the total number of eggs found by each person, we need to follow the given information:

- Lamar finds 5 eggs.
- Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
- Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
- Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs found by all the people: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we need to convert 3 dozen to a numerical value. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is equal to 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find the total number of apartments in the first two complexes, we multiply the number of apartments in each by 2:
200 * 2 = 400

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400:
60% of 400 = 0.6 * 400 = 240
Total apartments in the last complex = 400 + 240 = 640

Now, we add the total number of apartments in all three complexes:
400 + 400 + 640 = 1440

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

- Year 1 (5 years old): 50 fruits
- Year 2 (6 years old): 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
- Year 3 (7 years old): 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- Year 4 (8 years old): 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, but we don't know the production of a 10-year-old tree yet. Let's call the production of a 10-year-old tree 'x'. So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is x - 200.
- Year 5 (9 years old): 0 fruits (no production)
- Year 6 (10 years old): 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, we need to find the production of a 10-year-old tree to calculate the production of an 8-year-old tree. We know that a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. 

Now we can find the production of an 8-year-old tree: x - 200 = 1000. Solving for x, we get x = 1200.

Now we can find the production of an 8-year-old tree: x - 200 = 1200 - 200 = 1000 fruits.

Now we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1000 + 0 + 1000 = 1550

The final answer is: 1550"

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as x. Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the yellow rope is x + 7.

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so its length is 4x.

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 7) + 4x = 37

Combine like terms:

6x + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides:

6x = 30

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:

Length of the red rope = 4x = 4(5) = 20

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so if Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

2. After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount given to the sister 'x'. So, the amount left with Ronnie is $5 - x and the amount left with Rissa is $15 - x.

3. According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money after giving an equal amount to their little sister. This can be expressed as: (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15

4. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5 to get rid of the fraction: 5 * (15 - x) = 4 * 15
   This simplifies to: 75 - 5x = 60

5. Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 75 from both sides: -5x = -15
   Then, we divide both sides by -5: x = 3

6. Now that we know x, we can find the amount left with Ronnie: $5 - x = $5 - 3 = $2

"Let's break down the information given:

- There are 4 colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow.
- There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
- Half the mural is yellow.
- The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is the combination of red, white, and purple paint. Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as x. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the total amount of these three colors is 3x.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow. So, the other half is 6 pints (since 12 / 2 = 6). This 6 pints is the combination of red, white, and purple paint, which is 3x.

We can set up the equation: 3x = 6

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 6 / 3
x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and we know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to find the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, and then add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, we add the areas together: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

"To find the number of pods in the new box, we need to calculate 20% of 100 and add it to 100.

20% of 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20
Number of pods in the new box = 100 + 20 = 120

Now, we know that the new box costs $12 and has 120 pods. To find out how many cycles we can run for $1, we need to divide the number of pods by the cost of the box and then divide the result by the cost per cycle.

Cost per cycle = $12 / 120 = $0.1 per cycle

Now, we can divide the cost per cycle by $1 to find the number of cycles we can run for $1.

Number of cycles for $1 = $0.1 / $1 = 0.1

Since we can't run a fraction of a cycle, we round down to the nearest whole number.

Number of cycles for $1 = 0"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of bills is 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

4. He triples his money, which means he triples the number of bills. So, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now worth $5, the total amount of money he has is 60 * 5 = $300.

The final answer is: 300"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. 

Now, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to determine how many days he can use the chalk after Monday.

Initially, the teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk, which is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches. 

Now, the remaining chalk is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days he can use the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's set up an equation to find the number of days (x):

2.75 = 5 * (1 - 0.20)^x

Simplifying the equation:

2.75 = 5 * (0.80)^x

Divide both sides by 5:

0.55 = (0.80)^x

Now, we need to solve for x. We can use logarithms to do this:

log(0.55) = x * log(0.80)

x = log(0.55) / log(0.80)

Using a calculator to find the values of the logarithms:

x ≈ 3.04

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to find the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4. 
One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

"To find the percentage of teeth the dentist fixes, we need to first find the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth. 
The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the number of teeth capped is 4 + 7 = 11.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15.

The percentage of teeth the dentist fixes is (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the amount of milk that Mr. Marcellus returned, we need to calculate 2/5 of the total amount of milk he purchased. 

2/5 of 4000 gallons = (2/5) * 4000 = 1600 gallons

Since the cost of milk per gallon is $3.5, the total refund Mr. Marcellus got is:

Refund = 1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon
Refund = 1600 * 3.5
Refund = 5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
20 = C

Total number of books = 54

Since Bob is distributing the money to 3 schools, we need to divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school.

Number of books per school = Total number of books / Number of schools
Number of books per school = 54 / 3
Number of books per school = 18

"Let's break down the events step by step:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up 2 apples, put 1 in his pocket, and threw 1 back into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 6 new apples from the tree, making a total of 7 apples.
3. He put all but 1 of the new apples in his pocket, so he has 1 apple left outside and 6 apples in his pocket. Now, he has a total of 7 apples (in his pocket) + 1 apple (outside) = 8 apples.
4. He threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 6 new apples from the tree and the 6 apples already in his pocket, making a total of 12 apples in his pocket and 1 apple outside.
5. He picked up the remaining apple outside, so now he has 12 apples in his pocket and 1 apple in his hand, making a total of 13 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 13 apples."
"To find the total cost of Ali's order, we need to calculate the number of bags of coal he ordered and multiply it by the cost per bag.

Number of bags = Total weight of coal / Weight per bag

"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza that her friends will eat, and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

For cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is 6 * 6 = 36. Since each pizza has 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is 36 / 12 = 3.

For pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 4 * 6 = 24. Since each pizza has 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is 24 / 8 = 3.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, she needs a total of 3 + 3 = 6 pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. So, his rate of building snowballs is 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. So, the rate at which snowballs melt is 2/15 snowballs per minute.

The net rate at which Jay is building snowballs is the difference between the rate at which he builds them and the rate at which they melt. 

Net rate = (1/3) - (2/15)
To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 15. 
Net rate = (5/15) - (2/15) = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Now, we need to find how long it will take Jay to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 1/5 snowballs per minute. 

Time = Total number of snowballs / Net rate
Time = 60 / (1/5)
Time = 60 * 5
Time = 300 minutes

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to build 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find Jim's age, we need to first find John's age 20 years ago. 

Let's denote John's age 20 years ago as J. Since John is 28 now, his age 20 years ago would be 28 - 20 = 8.

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can set up the equation: J = 2 * Jim. 

Substituting J = 8, we get 8 = 2 * Jim.

To find Jim's age, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2: Jim = 8 / 2 = 4.

So, Jim is 4 years old now."
"To find out how many slices of apple they ate, we need to determine how many slices each person ate and add them up.

Doxa ate 1 slice. 
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices they ate: 
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6

"Let's break down the information given:

- On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
- On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages (since 1 pack = 50 bandages, 1/2 pack = 25 bandages).
- At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x. 

After the first day, they had x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages.
After the second day, they had (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16 bandages.
After the third day, they had (x - 16) - 25 + 100 = x + 59 bandages.

Since they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, we can set up the equation:
x + 59 = 78

Now, let's solve for x:
x = 78 - 59
x = 19

The initial number of bandages was 19."

"To find Jen's total earnings, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her total hours worked in April:
Total hours worked per week = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week
Total hours worked in April = 45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Next, let's calculate her total earnings from her hourly rate:
Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen had complete attendance for the month, she will receive an additional $10 for each day she worked. 
Total days worked in April = 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 24 days
Total attendance bonus = 24 days * $10/day = $240

Now, let's add her total earnings from her hourly rate and her attendance bonus:
Total earnings = $270 + $240 = $510

- $0.75 for taking the trash to the curb (twice) = 2 * $0.75 = $1.50
- $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher (6 times) = 6 * $0.50 = $3.00

Total amount earned in a week = $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $8.00

Since it's a two-week period, we multiply the weekly amount by 2:
$8.00 * 2 = $16.00

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600. 
   To find the cost per bottle of scotch, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: 
   Cost per bottle of scotch = $600 / 10 = $60.

2. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. 
   Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

3. Cognac costs 50% more per bottle than scotch. 
   To find the cost per bottle of cognac, we calculate 50% of the cost of scotch and add it to the cost of scotch: 
   50% of $60 = 0.5 * $60 = $30.
   Cost per bottle of cognac = $60 + $30 = $90.

4. Now, we find the total cost of cognac by multiplying the cost per bottle by the number of bottles: 
   Total cost of cognac = $90 * 20 = $1800.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let x be the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The problem states that ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8.

We are told that this expression is equal to 40, so we can set up the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the total amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to first calculate the total interest he owes his sister. 

The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he will pay in the first 11 months is 25 * 11 = $275.

The remaining amount, including the interest, will be paid in the twelfth month. This is the initial amount plus the interest minus the amount paid in the first 11 months: 300 + 6 - 275 = $31.

However, this is not the total amount he will pay in the twelfth month. We also need to add the $25 he would have paid in the twelfth month if he had paid $25 per month for 12 months. 

So, the total amount he will pay in the twelfth month is 31 + 25 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to first find out the total number of diapers changed per day. 

Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes per day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day.

Since Jordan's wife changes 5 diapers per day, Jordan changes the remaining half, which is also 5 diapers per day.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total volume of the jar, we need to calculate the area of the base and multiply it by the height. The base is a square with a side length of 6 inches, so the area is 6 * 6 = 36 square inches. The height of the jar is 15 inches, so the volume is 36 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume of the jar that can be occupied by jelly beans is 0.8 * 540 = 432 cubic inches.

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is 432 / 0.15 = 2880.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans is 0.3 * 2880 = 864.

However, the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between his guess and the true number of red jelly beans.

Since we don't know Tim's guess, we can't calculate the difference directly. However, we can calculate the percentage difference between his guess and the true number of red jelly beans.

Let's assume Tim's guess is x. The percentage difference is ((x - 900) / 900) * 100.

To find the actual number of jelly beans that Tim guessed, we need to find the number of red jelly beans that would make the percentage difference equal to the percentage of red jelly beans in the jar. Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the percentage difference should be 30%.

We can set up the equation: ((x - 900) / 900) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can first divide both sides by 100: (x - 900) / 900 = 0.3

Then, we can multiply both sides by 900: x - 900 = 270

Finally, we can add 900 to both sides: x = 1170

Now we can calculate the difference between Tim's guess and the true number of red jelly beans: 1170 - 900 = 270

The final answer is: 270"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the bus had 20 people.
2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.
3. At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop (40) entered the bus. This means 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.
4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, the bus has 200 - 180 = 20 spaces left.

"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for the first 5 years and the cost of visits for the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5. The annual cost is 3 * $5 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

The total cost for all visits is $30 + $45 = $75.

"To find the total number of students who can try the escape room, we need to multiply the number of students in each grade by the number of grades. 

There are 4 grades (4-7) and 10 students in each grade, so the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find the number of groups.

40 / 8 = 5

Since each group uses 45 minutes, we need to multiply the number of groups by the time each group uses.

5 * 45 = 225

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet, we can find the length of the longer piece:

Length of the longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32 feet

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we can find out how much seasoning he needs. He adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat.

Total pounds of meat needed = 5
Seasoning per pound = 2 tablespoons

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley.
2. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim.
3. Samantha has 27 paintings.

From point 1, we can express the relationship between Samantha and Shelley as: 
Samantha = Shelley - 12

Since Samantha has 27 paintings, we can substitute this value into the equation:
27 = Shelley - 12
Shelley = 27 + 12
Shelley = 39

Now, we know Shelley has 39 paintings. From point 2, we can express the relationship between Shelley and Kim as:
Shelley = Kim + 8
Substituting the value of Shelley:
39 = Kim + 8
Kim = 39 - 8
Kim = 31

"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the standard lessons and the reduced-rate lessons separately and then add them together.

For the standard lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. So, the total amount from standard lessons is:
4 * $80 = $320

For the reduced-rate lessons, Charlie has 2 lessons at 75% of his standard rate (since he reduces his rate by 25%). The reduced rate is:
$80 * 0.75 = $60 per hour

The total amount from reduced-rate lessons is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the original amount. 

Let's denote the number of pomelos Eve gave away as x. 

Since Eve is left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can set up the equation:

20 - x = (1/4) * 20

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction:

4(20 - x) = 20

Expanding the left side of the equation:

80 - 4x = 20

Now, let's isolate x by subtracting 80 from both sides:

-4x = -60

Dividing both sides by -4:

x = 15

So, Eve gave away 15 pieces of pomelos.

So, Walter ate 24 apples. 

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

60 - 24 = 36

Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. 

25% of 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. 

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining.

4. The remaining grapes are used by their mother to make pies. Let's denote the total number of grapes at the beginning as x.
5. Since their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.
6. The total number of grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.
7. Since the total number of grapes at the beginning is x, and 84 grapes were used, we can set up the equation: x - 84 = 0 (since the remaining grapes are 0 after they were all used).
8. Solving for x, we get x = 84.

"Let's break down the problem. 

Let the cost of each additional phone be x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation 2x = 20.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 20 / 2 = 10.

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is 4x = 4 * 10 = 40.

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones: 20 + 40 = 60.

The final answer is: $60"

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining four days.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.
On the second day, Conor saw 20 more people than on the first day, so he saw 50 + 20 = 70 people.
On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so he saw 2 * 70 = 140 people.

The total number of people Conor saw on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

"To find the total number of popcorn pieces, we need to calculate the number of kernels popped in each 30-second interval and add them up.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial popping rate popped, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels popped.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, so 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels popped.

- The tower has 4 blue blocks.
- It has twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.
- The total number of blocks in the tower is 32.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of blocks:

Blue blocks + Yellow blocks + Red blocks = Total blocks
4 + 8 + Red blocks = 32

To find the number of red blocks, we need to isolate the variable ""Red blocks"". We can do this by subtracting the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total:

Red blocks = Total blocks - (Blue blocks + Yellow blocks)
Red blocks = 32 - (4 + 8)
Red blocks = 32 - 12
Red blocks = 20

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31."
"To find out how much money Janet has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract that from the amount her parents gave her.

The total amount spent on movie tickets is 2 tickets * $7.50 = $15.

The total amount spent is $3.50 (ice cream) + $15 (movie tickets) + $8.50 (bracelet) = $27.

Janet's parents gave her $40, so the amount she has left is $40 - $27 = $13.

The final answer is: $13"
"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of days he is open and then multiply that by the number of cars he services per day and his hourly wage.

Josh is open 7 days a week, but he is closed on Sunday and Wednesday, so he is open 5 days a week. In 2 weeks, he will be open 5 days/week * 2 weeks = 10 days.

Since Josh services 3 cars a day, in 10 days, he will service 3 cars/day * 10 days = 30 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so in 10 days, he will make 30 cars * $4/car = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many cookies Randy has now, we need to track the changes in the number of cookies.

Initially, Randy has:
- 9 oatmeal cookies
- 4 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 sugar cookies

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

Then, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
- 4 sugar cookies (no change)

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
- 6 oatmeal cookies (no change)
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

Finally, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
- 6 + 4 = 10 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

Now, Randy has 10 oatmeal cookies, 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 6 sugar cookies. 

10 + 7 + 6 = 23"
"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get for the first half of the collection and the second half separately, and then add them together.

Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, we can divide them into two equal halves: 6 toy soldiers for the first half and 6 toy soldiers for the second half.

For the first half, Matthew would get 6 toy soldiers * $5 per toy = $30.

For the second half, Matthew would get 6 toy soldiers * $7 per toy = $42.

To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we add the amounts from the first and second halves: $30 + $42 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many holes the dog digs in total and then subtract the holes filled by Nate from the total holes.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Since the dog digs 6 new holes every night, we need to add these to the total holes. However, we don't know how many days Nate takes to fill the holes, so we can't directly calculate the number of nights. 

Let's assume it takes x weeks for Nate to fill the holes. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days is 7x.

In x weeks, the dog digs 6 * 7x = 42x new holes.

The total number of holes is 84 (initial holes) + 42x (new holes).

Nate fills 9 holes a day, so in 7x days, he fills 9 * 7x = 63x holes.

Since Nate fills the holes, the total number of holes remains the same, so we can set up the equation:

84 + 42x = 63x

Subtracting 42x from both sides gives us:

42 = 21x

Dividing both sides by 21 gives us:

x = 2

Since x is the number of weeks, the answer is 2 weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the average enrollment at Butler High School, we need to multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4.

Average enrollment at Norman High School = 4000
Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * 4000
= 3000

Now, we need to find the difference between the average enrollment at Norman High School and Butler High School.

Difference = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The final answer is: 2325"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
- Igor gathered two more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested: 14 + 2 = 16 test tubes, but we already know Igor gathered 8 test tubes, so this statement is incorrect. However, we can infer that Igor gathered 2 more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 - 2 = 14 Petri dishes is incorrect, but 14 - 2 = 12 Petri dishes is correct.
- Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers: 7 beakers.
- The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor gathered: 8 test tubes + 7 beakers + 12 Petri dishes = 27 items.

Since Igor had 29 items on the lab bench, he must have lost 29 - 27 = 2 items.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to find the number of eggs in the second basket and add it to the number of eggs in the first basket.

Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as in the first basket, and the first basket has 10 eggs, the second basket has 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 (first basket) + 20 (second basket) = 30 eggs.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to find the individual amounts raised by each girl and add them together.

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430. So, Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. So, Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we add up the amounts raised by each girl: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa.
2. Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron.
3. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
4. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

From point 2, we know that Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa did, so Aaron ran 4 / 2 = 2 miles.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, it will take Vanessa twice as long to run the same distance. Therefore, if Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, Vanessa would run 2 miles in 2 * 16 = 32 minutes.

However, Vanessa ran 4 miles, which is twice the distance Aaron ran. Since it takes Vanessa 32 minutes to run 2 miles, it will take her 2 * 32 = 64 minutes to run 4 miles.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line

Since he already has 6 feet of new line, we need to subtract this from the total amount of line required.

600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate their daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

Daily revenue = (2 meals * $5 per meal) + $5 bottle of wine
Daily revenue = (2 * $5) + $5
Daily revenue = $10 + $5
Daily revenue = $15

Since they are open 2 days a week, we multiply the daily revenue by 2:
Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * 2
Weekly revenue = $15 * 2
Weekly revenue = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"To find the cost of each watermelon, we first need to find the total selling price of all the watermelons. 

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price of each watermelon is $80 / 50 = $1.60.

Since the vendor sold all the watermelons at a profit of 25%, the selling price of each watermelon is 125% of the cost price (100% of the cost price + 25% profit).

The selling price of each watermelon is 1.25 * $1.60 = $2.

The selling price of each watermelon is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. James is now twice as old as Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that James is currently 2 * 12 = 24 years old.

2. Since James is 24 years old now and John had James when he was 19, John is currently 24 + 19 = 43 years old.

3. John's youngest son was born when John was 32. This means that the youngest son is currently 43 - 32 = 11 years old.

4. In 3 years, the youngest son will be 11 + 3 = 14 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many oranges Ana and Jane can peel in an hour. 

Let's assume the number of oranges Ana peels is 'A' and the number of oranges Jane peels is 'J'. 

Ana peels 1 orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60/3 = 20 oranges. 
Jane peels 1 orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60/4 = 15 oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is A - J = 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor cost.

The original cost of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, so he pays 20% of the original cost. 
20% of $400 = 0.2 * 400 = $80

The cost of the radiator is $80. 

The labor cost is 3 hours at $50 an hour. 
3 * 50 = $150

The total cost is the cost of the radiator plus the labor cost.
Total cost = $80 + $150 = $230

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write the equation:

2C + 4W = 70

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 to get:

2C + 2W = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate C:

(2C + 4W) - (2C + 2W) = 70 - 40
2W = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

W = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens:

C + 15 = 20
C = 5

So, there are 5 chickens on the farm.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, let's find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. 

Total number of slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

There are 4 people in total (Henry and his 3 friends). 

Number of slices per person = Total number of slices / Number of people = 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person

The final answer is: 14"
