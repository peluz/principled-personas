"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

Now, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. 

So, she makes 9 * 2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we need 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the blue and white fiber bolts together: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we need to first find the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

Let's calculate the new value of the house: 
New value = Original value + (Original value * 150%)
New value = $80,000 + ($80,000 * 1.5)
New value = $80,000 + $120,000
New value = $200,000

Now, we need to find the profit Josh made. To do this, we need to subtract the total cost (original price + repairs) from the new value of the house.
Total cost = Original price + Repairs
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he does in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James does this 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon. 

Morning feed: 15 cups
Afternoon feed: 25 cups
Total feed given in the morning and afternoon: 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Since Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per meal is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed per meal: 
60 - 40 = 20 cups

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
The fourth glass costs 60% of $1.8, which is 0.6 * $1.8 = $1.08. 
We can see that the cost of each glass is decreasing by 40% each time. 

The cost of the first glass is $5, the second is $3, the third is $1.8, the fourth is $1.08, the fifth is $0.64, the sixth is $0.384, the seventh is $0.2304, the eighth is $0.13824, the ninth is $0.082944, the tenth is $0.0497664, the eleventh is $0.02986584, the twelfth is $0.017949504, the thirteenth is $0.0107949304, the fourteenth is $0.00648696024, the fifteenth is $0.003876582144, the sixteenth is $0.002325949488.

Now, we add up the cost of all 16 glasses: 
$5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.64 + $0.384 + $0.2304 + $0.13824 + $0.082944 + $0.0497664 + $0.02986584 + $0.017949504 + $0.0107949304 + $0.00648696024 + $0.003876582144 + $0.002325949488 = $24.016

The total cost is $24.016."
"To find the number of sheep in Toulouse, we need to first find the number of sheep in Charleston. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle: 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file:
40% of 200 GB is 0.4 x 200 = 80 GB
Time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute = 80 / 2 = 40 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to install the updates:
20 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file:
60% of 200 GB is 0.6 x 200 = 120 GB
Time to download 120 GB at 2 GB/minute = 120 / 2 = 60 minutes

The total time is the sum of the time to download the first 40% of the file, the time to install the updates, and the time to download the remaining 60% of the file:
Total time = 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 minutes

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled in the first 3 hours and the distance he traveled in the last 4 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time

For the first 3 hours, John drove at 60 mph:
Distance = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

For the first 2 hours of the return trip, John was stuck in traffic, so he didn't move:
Distance = 0 miles

For the next half-hour, John drove at 30 mph:
Distance = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

For the remaining 2.5 hours of the return trip, John drove at 80 mph:
Distance = 80 * 2.5 = 200 miles

Total distance traveled in the return trip = 15 + 200 = 215 miles

Since John was driving back home, we need to subtract the distance he traveled from home to the point where he turned around (180 miles) from the total distance he traveled in the return trip (215 miles) to find the distance he is from home at the end of the 4 hours:
Distance from home = 215 - 180 = 35 miles

"To find Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately, then add them together.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime pay rate is:
$10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

Her overtime earnings are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings for the week are:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month, so we need to calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 
30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"

"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total revenue it generates each year.

The initial cost of the tree is $90. 

Each year, the tree generates revenue from selling lemons. Since the tree grows 7 lemons per year and each lemon sells for $1.5, the total revenue per year is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

However, it also costs $3 to water and feed the tree each year. So, the net revenue per year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

To find out how many years it will take for the tree to start earning money, we need to find the break-even point, which is when the total revenue equals the initial cost of the tree.

Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. The total revenue after 'x' years is $7.5x, and the total cost is $90. We want to find the smallest 'x' for which $7.5x ≥ $90.

Dividing both sides by $7.5, we get x ≥ $90 / $7.5.

x ≥ 12

Since 'x' represents the number of years, it must be a whole number. Therefore, it will take at least 13 years for the tree to start earning money.

The final answer is: 13"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, which is x/3.

At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2.

We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 6 to get rid of the fractions:

6x - 2x - 12 - 3(x - x/3 - 2) = 30

Combine like terms:

4x - 12 - 3x + x + 6 = 30

Combine like terms:

2x - 6 = 30

Add 6 to both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students

The remaining students after contemporary dance are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

The remaining students after jazz dance are 16 - 4 = 12 students.

The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance, which is 12 students out of 20.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To determine the profit, we need to calculate the future value of each investment. 

For the jewelry, the future value is $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125.

For the electronic gadgets, the future value is $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096.

The profit from the jewelry is $5,125 - $5,000 = $125.

The profit from the electronic gadgets is $8,096 - $8,000 = $96.

The merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit, which is $125."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. 

On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance.

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles.

"To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

In 4 weeks, she will eat 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat in 4 weeks.

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total time Marissa wants to take to complete the 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles, she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining 2 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can use the formula: speed = distance / time.

speed = 2 miles / 1 hour = 2 miles per hour

"To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. 

Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the remaining one-third is non-water. So, the non-water content in the orange drink is 10 - 6.67 = 3.33 liters.

Now, to find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, we need to calculate three-fifths of 15 liters.

Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the remaining two-fifths is non-water. So, the non-water content in the pineapple drink is 15 - 9 = 6 liters.

Now, we have 10 liters of orange drink and 15 liters of pineapple drink. We spill 1 liter of the orange drink, so we have 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink left.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is the sum of the water in the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink.

The water in the remaining orange drink is 6.67 - 1/3 of 1 liter (since 1 liter was spilled) = 6.67 - 0.33 = 6.34 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 6.34 + 9 = 15.34 liters.

The final answer is: 15.34"

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since the book was sold with a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of the original price, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so it is x - 0.25x = 0.75x.

We are given that the discounted price is $19.50. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

Total cost of chicken, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Now, we need to subtract the total cost of the chicken, milk, and apples from the total amount Marie paid to find the cost of the pizza boxes.

Cost of pizza boxes: $50 - $33 = $17

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can divide the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box to find the number of boxes.

Number of pizza boxes: $17 / $8.50 = 2

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will go through 60 servings in 60 days. 

Each carton has 15 servings, so the total number of cartons she buys is 60 / 15 = 4.

The cost per carton is $4.00, so the total amount she spends is 4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance traveled between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles. 

60 miles - 15 miles = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop and the distance from the second stop. 

Distance from the first stop = 20 miles
Distance from the second stop = 45 miles

Distance between the two stops = Distance from the first stop - Distance from the second stop
= 20 miles - 45 miles
However, this is incorrect because we are subtracting a larger number from a smaller number. We should subtract the smaller number from the larger number.

Distance between the two stops = Distance from the second stop - Distance from the first stop
= 45 miles - 20 miles
= 25 miles

The distance between Henry's first and second stops is 25 miles.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let the cost of the cheaper pair of heels be x dollars. 
The cost of the more expensive pair of heels is 2x dollars. 
The total cost of the two pairs of heels is 5 dollars less than the boots, so we can write the equation: x + 2x = boots - 5. 
Combine like terms: 3x = boots - 5. 
We also know that one pair of heels costs $33, so we can set up the equation x = 33. 
Substitute x = 33 into the equation 3x = boots - 5: 3(33) = boots - 5. 
Simplify the equation: 99 = boots - 5. 
Add 5 to both sides of the equation: 104 = boots.

3. Combine like terms: 18x = 162
4. Divide both sides by 18: x = 9
5. Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age: Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99
6. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age: Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

Number of dogs: 10
Time per dog: 0.5 hours

Total time per day = Number of dogs * Time per dog
Total time per day = 10 * 0.5
Total time per day = 5 hours

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the total time per day by 7 to find the total time per week.

Total time per week = Total time per day * 7
Total time per week = 5 * 7
Total time per week = 35 hours

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We are given that G = S + 30. We also know that the total number of coins is 110, so S + G = 110.

Substituting G = S + 30 into the second equation, we get S + (S + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2S = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30: G = 40 + 30 = 70.

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = $195.

Next, we need to find out how much money he spent on video games. He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so the total amount of money he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

Since he had $5 left after buying the video games, we can find out how much money he had before buying the video games by adding the money he had left to the money he spent on video games: $160 + $5 = $165.

Now, we can find out how much money he made from selling the Lego sets by subtracting the money he had before buying the video games from the total amount of money he made: $195 - $165 = $30.

However, this is the money he made from selling the Lego sets, not the number of Lego sets he sold. To find the number of Lego sets he sold, we can divide the money he made from selling the Lego sets by the price of each Lego set: $30 / $15 = 2.

Since John started with 13 Lego sets, we can find out how many Lego sets he still has by subtracting the number of Lego sets he sold from the total number of Lego sets he had: 13 - 2 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his total running time and then divide the total distance by the total time.

John runs 3 hours the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

Total running time = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours

Since John runs 3 days a week, we need to multiply the total running time by 3 to get the total weekly running time. However, we are given that he runs 60 miles a week, so we can directly use the given information.

Total weekly running time = 60 miles / (speed) = 6 hours

Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to find Dana's walking speed and running speed first. 

Given that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, we can find her running speed by multiplying her skipping speed by 2. 

Running speed = 2 * Skipping speed
Running speed = 2 * 3
Running speed = 6 miles per hour

Given that Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4.

Walking speed = Running speed / 4
Walking speed = 6 / 4
Walking speed = 1.5 miles per hour

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, in 6 hours, she will spend 2 hours running and 4 hours walking.

Distance traveled while running = Speed * Time
Distance traveled while running = 6 * 2
Distance traveled while running = 12 miles

Distance traveled while walking = Speed * Time
Distance traveled while walking = 1.5 * 4
Distance traveled while walking = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance traveled while running + Distance traveled while walking
Total distance traveled = 12 + 6
Total distance traveled = 18 miles

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to first find the age of Ben's iPhone. Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, and Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, and Ben's iPhone is 2 years old, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone, we need to multiply the original distance by 3. 

Original distance = 400 feet
Distance with gemstone = 400 * 3 = 1200 feet

Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1000 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the javelin. However, we need to find the distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames. 

Distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames = 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces. 

First, let's find the total number of pieces. Since Grandma Jones cut each pie into 8 pieces and she baked 5 pies, the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40.

Now, let's subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces to find out how many pieces were taken by the guests. 
40 (total pieces) - 14 (remaining pieces) = 26

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many calories you can still consume, subtract the calories you've already consumed from your daily target: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, multiply the number of servings you can still consume by the total weight of the bag: 0.8 * 300g = 240g.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Total cost = Cost of supplies + Cost of beeswax
Since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles.
Total cost of beeswax = 2 pounds * $5.00 (assuming $5.00 per pound of beeswax, since the cost of 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00)
Total cost of beeswax = $10.00
Total cost = $10.00 (supplies) + $10.00 (beeswax)
Total cost = $20.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Total number of articles written in 3 days = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since it takes 4 hours to write one article, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to first determine how many Post-it notes she used in total. 

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work. To find the total number of Post-it notes she used, we add 80 and 220: 80 + 220 = 300. 

Since she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, we need to subtract 23 from the total number of Post-it notes she used to find out how many she purchased: 300 - 23 = 277.

The final answer is: 277"
"To find the total amount spent on ties, we first need to determine the number of blue ties and the cost of red ties.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per tie:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

The cost of red ties is 50% more than blue ties, which means the cost of red ties is 1.5 times the cost of blue ties:

Cost of red ties = 1.5 * Cost of blue ties
= 1.5 * $40
= $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of red ties
= 10 * $60
= $600

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

1 foot is equal to 12 inches. 

So, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches):

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces."
"To find the total number of units in the building, we multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor: 15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units. To do this, we multiply the total number of units by 1/4: 120 units * 1/4 = 30 units.

"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs are produced per week: 
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since eggs are sold in dozens, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens: 
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total amount Lloyd makes per week: 
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

"To find the total time Tom spends traveling, we need to calculate the time he spends traveling from 1 to 4 PM and the time he spends traveling back.

First, let's find the distance he travels from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels at 10 miles per hour, we can use the formula: distance = speed * time. However, we don't know the time, but we know the distance is 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM). 

distance = speed * time
3 hours = 10 miles/hour * time
time = 3 hours / 10 miles/hour
time = 0.3 hours

Now, let's find the time he spends traveling back. We know the distance is the same (3 hours * 10 miles/hour = 30 miles), and his speed is 6 miles per hour.

time = distance / speed
time = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour
time = 5 hours

However, this is the time for the round trip. To find the total time, we need to add the time he spends traveling from 1 to 4 PM (0.3 hours) and the time he spends traveling back (5 hours).

total time = 0.3 hours + 5 hours
total time = 5.3 hours

The final answer is: 5.3"
"To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the total weight of the comic books he removed. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removed 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books already removed weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys to be removed can be calculated by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately and then add them together.

Thursday: 
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 * $60 = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 * $40 = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Friday: 
- Revenue from truck tires: 0 * $60 = $0
- Revenue from car tires: 12 * $40 = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $0 + $480 = $480

Since the total revenue on Thursday ($520) is higher than the total revenue on Friday ($480), we need to find the difference between the two.

Difference in revenue: $520 - $480 = $40

"To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately and then add them together.

The first half of the year is 6 months, and the second half of the year is also 6 months. 

The initial amount charged per month is $140. 

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the company charged her 10% less than the initial amount. 
10% of $140 is 0.1 * $140 = $14. 
So, the amount charged for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126 per month.

Since there are two girls, they each got 4 liters, so together they got 8 liters. 

Now, we subtract the total amount of water the girls got from the initial 24 liters. 

24 - 8 = 16 liters

Then, we subtract the 6 liters the boy got from the remaining 16 liters.

16 - 6 = 10 liters

"To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he had initially and then subtract the number of stickers he gave away or used.

Initially, Charlie had 10 stickers.

He bought 21 stickers from a store, so now he has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.

He got 23 stickers for his birthday, so now he has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.

Then, he gave 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.

Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find Alex's weight, we need to calculate 4 times Grace's weight and then subtract 2 pounds from it. 

4 times Grace's weight is 4 * 125 = 500 pounds. 
Alex's weight is 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now, to find their combined weight, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight: 
125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

The final answer is: 623"

The total number of thorns is 600."
"To find the number of games the team won, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of games they lost is x. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

Since x represents the number of games lost, the number of games won is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of years Gene has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of vacations he goes on per year.

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34, so he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

He goes on 4 vacations per year, so the total number of quilt blocks is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time it went off and add them up.

The first time, the alarm rang 4 times.

The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add up the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after the 5-year mark and then increase it by 10% for each of the next three years.

Initial salary: $600
Increase after 5 years: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 5 years: $600 + $60 = $660

Now, we need to increase her salary by 10% for each of the next three years.

Salary after 6 years: $660 + (10% of $660) = $660 + 0.1 * $660 = $660 + $66 = $726
Salary after 7 years: $726 + (10% of $726) = $726 + 0.1 * $726 = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60
Salary after 8 years: $798.60 + (10% of $798.60) = $798.60 + 0.1 * $798.60 = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $878.46."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as H. Since Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10H.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is given as 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

Number of invited guests: 16
Number of guests who don't show up: 16 * 1/4 = 4
Number of guests who will attend: 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we can multiply the number of guests who will attend by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

Number of gift bags needed: 12 * 0.75 = 9

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag.

Cost per gift bag: $2
Total cost: 9 * $2 = $18

"To find Gerald's original time, we need to add 2 seconds to Lee's time, since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald. 

Lee's time is 38 seconds, so Gerald's original time is 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so we need to find 10% of 40 and add it to 40.

10% of 40 is 0.1 * 40 = 4.

Gerald's new time is 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats.
2. There are two cats for every dog.
3. The number of dogs is 60.

Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, the number of cats can be calculated as follows:
Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know the number of dogs and cats. The combined number of dogs and cats is:
Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

According to the first point, the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats:
Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats:
Total number of pets = Number of rabbits + Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 168 + 60 + 120
= 348

The final answer is: 348"

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we first need to determine the total volume of the tomatoes before they were cooked. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and it's half the volume of the tomatoes, the total volume of the tomatoes must be 32 * 2 = 64 ounces.

Since each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can divide the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can to find out how many cans were used: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so we can multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can to find the total number of tomatoes used: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes and the number of cars that took an exit from the total number of cars.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as x.

The total number of cars is 30. 
5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. 
So, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes (x) plus the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes (20) is equal to the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam (25).

x + 20 = 25

To find x, we need to subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

x = 25 - 20
x = 5

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first calculate how many potted plants she has in total. 

She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she has 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants. 

She also received 18 new potted plants from the nursery, so now she has 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.

Tomorrow, she will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to her friends and family, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants she will have left, we need to subtract the number of potted plants she gave away from the total number of potted plants she had. 

So, 98 - 40 = 58.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and add them up.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, which is 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.
The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, and since the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.
The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings:
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

First, we need to find out how many 3-mile sections are in 42 miles. We can do this by dividing 42 by 3.

42 miles / 3 miles per section = 14 sections

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile section, we multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section.

14 sections * 10 minutes per section = 140 minutes

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV and subtract the time spent watching other episodes. 

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 2 episodes of 1-hour shows, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours. 
On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. 
On Friday, he watched 2 episodes of 1-hour shows, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours. 

Total time spent watching other episodes is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours. 
Since he watched 7 hours of TV in total, the time spent watching 30-minute episodes on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours. 

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is 1.5 / 0.5 = 3.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.
2. This year, Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so he bakes 2x cookies.
3. However, he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.
4. After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.
5. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110.
6. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 2x = 100.

"To find the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards, and then subtract the cashback rewards.

The cost of gas per gallon is $3.00, and the person is buying 10 gallons. 

Total cost of gas = cost per gallon * number of gallons
Total cost of gas = $3.00 * 10
Total cost of gas = $30.00

The cashback rewards are $0.20 per gallon, and the person is buying 10 gallons.

Total cashback rewards = cashback per gallon * number of gallons
Total cashback rewards = $0.20 * 10
Total cashback rewards = $2.00

Now, we subtract the total cashback rewards from the total cost of gas to find the final cost.

Final cost = Total cost of gas - Total cashback rewards

"To find the total cost of the lumber, we need to calculate the cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards and the 4 x 4 x 10 boards separately and then add them together.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 per board = $100.

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. 

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 per board.
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 per board.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. If we let Lylah's salary be x, then Adrien's salary is 1.3x.

We are also given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000. Since his salary increased by 40% over four years, we can set up the equation:

1.4(40000) = 1.3x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 40000 / 1.3
x = 30769.23

So Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30769.23.

Now, we need to find their salaries four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40% over four years, so his new salary is:

1.4(40000) = 56000

Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, so her new salary is:

1.4(30769.23) = 43156.72

The total salary of the two four years later is:

56000 + 43156.72 = 99156.72

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

The rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday) she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept for each period:

- Monday: 8 hours

First, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours (7 - 3 = 4):
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distances together to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:
Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total Distance = 50 miles

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to figure out how many letters Jennie added to the pile. 

Since Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, she added one-third of 60 letters to the pile. 

One-third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20 letters.

So, Jennie added 20 letters to the pile of already-stamped letters. 

Since there are now 30 letters in the pile, we can subtract 20 from 30 to find out how many letters were in the pile when Jennie began.

30 - 20 = 10

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many spoons were in the package that Julia bought, we need to subtract the total number of spoons she had at the end (12) from the number of spoons she had after her husband gave her the new spoons (12 + 5 = 17) and then add back the 3 spoons she used. 

17 (total after husband's spoons) - 12 (total at the end) = 5 spoons used by Julia
5 (used by Julia) + 3 (used by Julia) = 8 spoons used in total
17 (total after husband's spoons) - 8 (used by Julia) = 9 spoons in the package Julia bought.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages. 

Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 
He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages: 38 + 44 = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we need to add the number of friends each of them has. 

Lily has 50 friends. 
Amy has 20 more friends than Lily, so Amy has 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

Now, let's add the number of friends Lily and Amy have together: 
50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to determine the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity.

1. The cost of each pepper is given as $15.
2. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, so the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.
3. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each item:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total amount charged to patients, then subtract the cost from the revenue.

First, let's find the total time spent by doctors:
500 patients/day * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes/day
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total minutes to hours:
12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours/day

The cost for the doctors is:
200 hours/day * $150/hour = $30000/day

Now, let's find the total amount charged to patients:
500 patients/day * $200/hour * (24 minutes / 60 hours) = 500 * $200 * 0.4 = $80000/day

The profit is the difference between the revenue and the cost:
Profit = Revenue - Cost
Profit = $80000 - $30000
Profit = $50000

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides each person took and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she rode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides is 4 (Pam's rides) + 6 (Fred's rides) = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first determine how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We already know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. 

So, the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles. 

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage for the three days: 41 - 28 = 13 miles.

"To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

First, let's find out how many questions Mark completed in 8 hours: 
8 hours * 5 questions/hour = 40 questions

Since Mark completed 40 questions in 8 hours, he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete in the first test.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.

Now, let's find out how many questions Mark completed in 6 hours: 
6 hours * 5 questions/hour = 30 questions

Since Mark completed 30 questions in 6 hours, he left 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete in the second test.

Now, let's add the number of incomplete questions from both tests to find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete:

"To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we need to subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Total number of cars = 20
Number of automatic cars = 12
Number of manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100

"Let's break down the information given:

- Let the number of baby bees be x.
- Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2x.
- There are twice as many babies as queens, so the number of queens is x/2.
- The total number of bees in the hive is 700.

We can set up an equation based on the total number of bees:

x (babies) + 2x (worker bees) + x/2 (queens) = 700

To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 1400

Combine like terms:

7x = 1400

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for x:

x = 200

Since the number of worker bees is 2x, we can multiply x by 2:

2x = 2 * 200
2x = 400

The final answer is: 400"

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day, if he spent that time working instead, he would work 2 hours a day.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours he would work in a week is:
2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week

Now, we multiply the total hours he would work in a week by his hourly wage:
14 hours/week * $10/hour = $140/week

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of food items and non-food items separately and then add them together.

Food items: 
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
Total cost of food items: 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
Total cost of non-food items: 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
Tax = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax to the cost of non-food items:
Total cost of non-food items with tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax:
Total cost = 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left return, which is 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees.
3. So, after 12 hours, there are 30 - 15 = 15 bees that haven't returned yet.
4. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 leave the hive, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
5. Now, we have a total of 15 (initial bees that left and haven't returned) + 60 (new bees that left) = 75 bees that haven't returned yet.
6. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before that (15) return to the hive.

So, the number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 15.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy.
- James has four times as many friends as Dorothy.
- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook.

Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can set up an equation to find out how many friends Dorothy has. Let's call the number of friends Dorothy has ""x"". Then, Charlie has 3x friends.

We know Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation: 3x = 12

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 12 / 3
x = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook.

Now, we know James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, James has 4 * 4 = 16 friends on Facebook.

"To find out who will win the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet for both Steve and Tim. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, we can convert their distances as follows:

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school:

Steve's time: distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes to get home and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will win the race. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time:

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and 5 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is 5 * 2 = 10. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * 25 cents = $2.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and 3 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is 3 * 3 = 9. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * 25 cents = $2.25.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and 1 person came by to get their tire inflated. So, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is 1 * 1 = 1.

The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * 25 cents = $0.25.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total number of fries eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
   Now, the total number of fries eaten by Dave, the seagull, and the pigeons is 21 + 9 = 30.
4. A raccoon ate two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's denote the total number of fries initially as x. 
   After the pigeons ate, the remaining fries are x - 30. 
   The raccoon ate 2/3 of (x - 30), which is (2/3)(x - 30).
   The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30).
   Simplifying this, we get (1/3)(x - 30).
5. After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. 
   So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.
   Solving for x, we get (1/3)(x - 30) = 6.
   Multiplying both sides by 3, we get x - 30 = 18.
   Adding 30 to both sides, we get x = 48.

"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. 

To find the total distance Kelly ran, we add the distance she ran back and forth and the distance she ran to the 40-yard line and back. So, the total distance Kelly ran is 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance. So, 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then add them together.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and since an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

One red car costs $4, and there are 5 red cars, so the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

The total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we add the cost of the doll, the red cars, and the action figures together: $15 (doll) + $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) = $50.

The total worth of all the toys is $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself:

Income lost = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's compare this to the cost of hiring the accountant:

Cost of hiring the accountant = $90

Since the income lost is greater than the cost of hiring the accountant, Jackie will actually be better off hiring the accountant. To find out how much more money she'll have, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the income she'll lose:

Difference = Income lost - Cost of hiring the accountant
= $105 - $90
= $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can write an equation:

S = 2B

In 2 years, their ages will be B + 2 and S + 2. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the equation:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can find Seth's age by multiplying Brooke's age by 2:

S = 2B
S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to first determine what ""twice the money Ethel has"" is. Since Ethel has $8, twice that amount would be 2 * 8 = 16.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The hat costs $25.

The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.

The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost of the hat and jacket is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (pants) = $150.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can find the total age of the four birds by adding their ages together: 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirtytwo) = 51

- Credit card: $200 * 1.5 = $300
- Mortgage: $500 * 1.5 = $750

Now, let's add up the increased minimum payments:
$450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much they made in total from selling lemonade and then subtract the cost of sugar to find the cost of lemons.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the total revenue per gallon is:
   20 glasses/gallon * $0.50/glass = $10/gallon

2. They made a profit of $25, so their total revenue is:
   Total revenue = Profit + Cost
   Total revenue = $25 + Cost

3. Since they sell each gallon for $10, the number of gallons they sold is:
   Total revenue = Number of gallons * $10/gallon
   $25 + Cost = Number of gallons * $10/gallon

4. We can now solve for the number of gallons:
   Number of gallons = ($25 + Cost) / $10

5. Since they made a profit, the cost must be less than the revenue. Let's assume the cost is x. Then the number of gallons is:
   Number of gallons = ($25 + x) / $10

6. The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. The cost of sugar per gallon is $2, so the cost of lemons per gallon is:
   Cost of lemons per gallon = $5 - $2 = $3

7. The total cost of lemons is the cost of lemons per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons:
   Total cost of lemons = Cost of lemons per gallon * Number of gallons
   Total cost of lemons = $3 * (($25 + x) / $10)

8. Since we are given that the total profit is $25, we can set up the equation:
   Total revenue - Total cost = Profit
   $10 * (($25 + x) / $10) - ($3 * (($25 + x) / $10)) = $25

9. Simplify the equation:
   ($25 + x) - ($3 * ((25 + x) / 10)) = $25
   ($25 + x) - (0.3 * (25 + x)) = $25
   ($25 + x) - (7.5 + 0.3x) = $25
   $25 + x - 7.5 - 0.3x = $25
   17.5 - 0.3x = 0
   -0.3x = -17.5
   x = 58.33

10. Now that we have the total cost, we can find the cost of lemons:
    Total cost of lemons = $3 * (($25 + 58.33) / $10)
    Total cost of lemons = $3 * (83.33 / 10)
    Total cost of lemons = $3 * 8.333
    Total cost of lemons = $25

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. 

Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is 4x.

The number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, which is 5x. However, we are given that the number of pink calla lilies is 200. So, we can set up the equation 5x = 200.

To find the value of x, we need to solve the equation 5x = 200. 

Divide both sides of the equation by 5 to isolate x: 
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the number of red roses. The number of red roses is 4x, so we multiply 4 by 40:
4x = 4 * 40
4x = 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 2, we can write an equation to represent the situation two years ago:

Mark's age two years ago = (1/2) * Jan's age two years ago + 5

Since Jan is 30 now, two years ago Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Mark's age two years ago = (1/2) * 28 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 14 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 19

Now, we know Mark's age two years ago was 19. To find Mark's current age, we add 2 years:

Mark's current age = 19 + 2
Mark's current age = 21

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's age:

Jean's age = Mark's age + 2
Jean's age = 21 + 2
Jean's age = 23

The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

"To find the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3, we need to count the favorable outcomes and divide by the total number of outcomes.

There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 or 50%.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to count the favorable outcomes and divide by the total number of outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Now, we need to find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row. 

The difference in probability is 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

To express this as a percentage, we need to divide by the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and multiply by 100.

"To find out how many apples Jenna picked, we need to find half of the number of apples her mom picked. Since her mom picked 20 apples, Jenna picked half of that, which is 20 / 2 = 10 apples.

So, Jenna picked 10 apples and her mom picked 20 apples. To find the total number of apples they both picked, we add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mom picked: 10 + 20 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the number of rats in each cage, we first need to determine the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters) and the total number of straw pieces distributed among them. 

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of rats is 3r. 

The total number of hamsters is 10. 

The total number of straw pieces distributed among the rats is 3r * 6 = 18r. 
The total number of straw pieces distributed among the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50. 

The total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents is 160. We also know that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits, so the total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents and the rabbits is 160 + 20 = 180.

We can set up the equation: 18r + 50 = 180.

Now, let's solve for 'r':

18r = 180 - 50
18r = 130
r = 130 / 18
r = 7.22 (round down to the nearest whole number is not possible here as we are looking for the number of rats in each cage, so we will round to the nearest whole number that makes sense in the context of the problem)

However, since we are distributing the straw among the rats in equal groups, the number of rats in each cage must be a whole number. We can try different values of 'r' to see which one satisfies the equation.

Let's try r = 7:
18r = 18 * 7 = 126 (less than 180)
Let's try r = 8:
18r = 18 * 8 = 144 (still less than 180)
Let's try r = 9:
18r = 18 * 9 = 162 (still less than 180)
Let's try r = 10:
18r = 18 * 10 = 180 (matches the total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents)

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is 10."
"To find the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The initial amount owed is $100.
The monthly interest rate is 2% or 0.02.

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

The total interest is $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

The total amount Mandy should pay is the initial amount plus the total interest: $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

Rounded to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to first calculate the total cost and total revenue.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $400. So, we can set up the equation:

$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$8x = $400

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 8:

x = $400 / $8
x = 50

The trader sold 50 bags."
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he collects peaches and then multiply it by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we know John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the total minutes by the peaches collected per minute:

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks needs per day, we first need to find out how many pounds of insects they need per week. Since there are 10 ducks and each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we multiply the number of ducks by the amount of insects each duck needs per week.

10 ducks * 3.5 pounds/duck/week = 35 pounds/week

Next, we need to find out how many days are in a week. There are 7 days in a week.

Now, we divide the total pounds of insects needed per week by the number of days in a week to find out how many pounds of insects the flock needs per day.

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

"To find the total number of trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees over 10 years, then subtract the trees that die.

Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net change in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8.

Over 10 years, the net change is 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

Tom starts with 50 trees, so after 10 years, he has 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 * 0.3 = 39.

So, the number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find the number of pink and white flamingos, we need to break down the events step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, the number of pink flamingos left is 18 - 6 = 12, and the number of white flamingos is 6.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is now 12 + 18 = 30, and the number of white flamingos remains 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

"To find out how many crayons Violetta can buy, we need to divide the amount of money she has by the cost of one crayon. 

Number of crayons = Total money / Cost of one crayon
Number of crayons = $20 / $2
Number of crayons = 10

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color. 

Total number of crayons she can buy = 2 * 5
Total number of crayons she can buy = 10

Since she can buy 10 crayons in total and she needs 5 different colors, she will have 5 crayons left over.

Change = Total money - Total cost of crayons
Change = $20 - (2 * 10)
Change = $20 - $20
Change = $0

However, since she has 5 crayons left over, she can either return them or keep them."
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser, since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. 

Cost of a pencil: $1.20
Cost of an eraser: $0.30

"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to calculate the total pounds of carrots distributed to the restaurants and subtract that from the total pounds of carrots available.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots distributed = 2 pounds/restaurant * 40 restaurants = 80 pounds

Now, subtract the total pounds of carrots distributed from the total pounds of carrots available:

Total pounds of carrots available = 200 pounds
Total pounds of carrots distributed = 80 pounds

Pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds of carrots available - Total pounds of carrots distributed
= 200 pounds - 80 pounds
= 120 pounds

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to calculate his new salary after the 5% raise and then multiply it by the number of weeks he works in a year.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his current salary:
5% of $2000 = 0.05 * $2000 = $100
New salary = $2000 + $100 = $2100

Since John works every week of the year, there are 52 weeks in a year. 

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the year:
Total earnings = New salary * Number of weeks
Total earnings = $2100 * 52
Total earnings = $109,200

Additionally, John received a one-time monetary reward of $5000.

Janet bought 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens.
Janet bought 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

The total number of new pens Janet bought is 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 66 pens.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she had a total of 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn. 

Let's calculate how much more money she needs to earn: $70 - $10 = $60.

Now, let's calculate how much she earns from babysitting: $5 * 4 = $20.

The amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn is $60 - $20 = $40.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can divide the amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn by the amount she earns per mowing: $40 / $4 = 10.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We know that W = R + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can set up the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers she counted on the first two days. 

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. 
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers on the first two days is x + (x + 50) = 2x + 50.

We know that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. Since the number of customers on the third day is included in this total, we can set up the equation: 2x + 50 + y = 500, where y is the number of customers on the third day.

However, we are trying to find y, and we know that y = x + 50. So we can substitute y with x + 50 in the equation: 2x + 50 + (x + 50) = 500.

Combine like terms: 3x + 100 = 500.

Subtract 100 from both sides: 3x = 400.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 133.33.

Since x is the number of customers on the first day, and we know that the number of customers on the second day is x + 50, we can find the number of customers on the second day: 133.33 + 50 = 183.33.

Now we can find the number of customers on the third day: y = x + 50 = 133.33 + 50 = 183.33 + 50 = 233.33.

However, the number of customers must be a whole number. We can round the number of customers on the first day to the nearest whole number, which is 133. 

Now we can find the number of customers on the second day: 133 + 50 = 183.

Now we can find the number of customers on the third day: 183 + 134 = 317.

The final answer is: 317"
"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of water loss for both pools is 8 gallons/minute (4 gallons/minute each).

In 4 minutes, the total amount of water lost from both pools is 8 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 32 gallons.

The big pool initially had 2x gallons of water and lost 32 gallons in 4 minutes, so the amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 32 gallons.

The small pool initially had x gallons of water and lost 32 gallons in 4 minutes, so the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 32 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 32 = 4(x - 32)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 32 = 4x - 128

Subtract 2x from both sides:

-32 = 2x - 128

Add 128 to both sides:

96 = 2x

Divide both sides by 2:

48 = x

So the initial amount of water in the small pool was 48 gallons. 

Now, we need to find the amount of water in the small pool now. We already calculated that the small pool lost 32 gallons in 4 minutes, so the amount of water in the small pool now is:

x - 32 = 48 - 32 = 16 gallons.

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn, which is the cost of the shoes and the belt. 

Total cost = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Since Lori earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours to work = 44 hours

"To find the total amount Janeth will pay, we need to calculate the total interest she will pay over 12 months. 

First, let's find the interest she will pay each month. 10% of $2000 is 0.1 x $2000 = $200. 

Since she will pay $165 a month, the remaining amount after paying the interest is $165 - $200 = -$35. However, this is not possible as she cannot pay a negative amount. This means she is not paying the interest each month, but rather a fixed amount.

Let's assume she pays the interest over the 12 months. The total interest she will pay is $200. 

However, since she is paying $165 a month, she will pay a total of $165 x 12 = $1980 over 12 months.

Now, we add the time it takes for each leg of the trip: 
6 days (bus to Rochester) + 6 days (car from Rochester) = 12 days.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we need to first calculate the total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type and buying 14 grass type.

Initial total cards = 30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 40 (water) = 90

After losing 8 water type cards:
Water type cards = 40 - 8 = 32
Total cards = 30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 32 (water) = 82

After buying 14 grass type cards:
Total cards = 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

Now, to find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100.

Percentage chance = (32 / 96) * 100 ≈ 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33."
"To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito is $6.50. 
He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. 
So, the total cost of the add-ons is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.
The total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the new total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.
He has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find out how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to calculate their combined rate. 

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, which is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute. 

Their combined rate is 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate. 

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the number of melons not ready to be harvested after two weeks, we need to calculate the number of melons harvested in the two instances and subtract that from the total number of melons.

Initially, 30% of 120 melons were ready for harvest, which is 0.3 * 120 = 36 melons. 

So, 120 - 36 = 84 melons were left after the first harvest.

After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining 84 melons were ready for harvest, which is (3/4) * 84 = 63 melons.

So, 84 - 63 = 21 melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

1. Total cost of the cars: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000
2. Tax on the cars: 10% of $240,000 = 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000
3. Registration fees: 12 cars * $1000 per car = $12,000
4. Total cost: $240,000 (cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration) = $276,000

"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we first need to determine how many shells she collected on Monday. 

On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, so Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. To find out how many shells she collects on Tuesday, we multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2. 

25 * 2 = 50

So, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday. 

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we first need to find the number of bugs. Since there are half as many bugs as ants, and there are 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = Number of ants / 2
Number of bugs = 50 / 2
Number of bugs = 25

Now, to find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and bugs:

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
Total number of insects = 50 + 25
Total number of insects = 75

The final answer is: 75"
"To find out how many penguins are left sunbathing, we need to calculate the number of penguins that jumped in the ocean and the number that went inside the cave, and then subtract that from the total number of penguins.

One-third of the penguins jumped in the ocean: 36 / 3 = 12 penguins
Another one-third went inside the cave: 36 / 3 = 12 penguins

Total penguins that left: 12 + 12 = 24 penguins

Now, subtract the total penguins that left from the initial number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12 penguins

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many vines Steve needs, we first need to determine how many tomatoes he eats per week. 

Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply this by 7 to get the total tomatoes he eats per week: 
6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve. 
So, his girlfriend eats 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes/day. 
His girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

The total number of tomatoes they eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes per vine to find the number of vines needed: 
63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how many pizzas John needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of slices required and then divide it by the number of slices per pizza.

Total number of friends: 20
Number of slices per friend: 4

Number of slices per pizza: 8
Number of pizzas required: 80 / 8 = 10

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"To find the total number of pens Ram gets, we need to calculate the number of new pens he can make from the ink of the 25 pens he buys. 

Since he can make one full pen from the ink of five empty pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens from the first set of 25 pens. 

Now, he has 5 new pens and the ink from the 5 empty pens he used to make the new pens. He can use the ink from these 5 empty pens to make 5 / 5 = 1 new pen.

So, the total number of pens he gets is 5 (new pens) + 1 (new pen) = 6 pens.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total amount of money Johnny had after a year, we need to follow the steps:

1. Johnny started with $20 and added an extra $10, so the total amount he had initially is $20 + $10 = $30.
2. This sum of $30 tripled in a year, so we need to multiply $30 by 3 to find the total amount after a year.

$30 * 3 = $90

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to determine the ages of Mary and Joan first.

Jessa is 20 years old. 
Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan's age is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.
Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.

Now, we can find the sum of their ages: 
20 (Jessa's age) + 25 (Joan's age) + 23 (Mary's age) = 68

"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to follow the given sequence of events.

Initially, there were 1000 students in the hall.

30% of the students went out through exit A:
30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students went out through exit A.
Remaining students = 1000 - 300 = 700

3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B:
3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students went out through exit B.
Remaining students = 700 - 420 = 280

The rest of the students went out through exit C:
280 students went out through exit C.

The final answer is: 280"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. John has 54 candies.
2. John has twice as many candies as Robert, so Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.
3. James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has: 54 - 33 = 21.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the total number of books read, we need to calculate the number of books each person reads and then add them together.

Dolly has 2 books and reads her own 2 books, as well as Pandora's 1 book. So, Dolly reads a total of 2 + 1 = 3 books.

Pandora has 1 book and reads her own 1 book, as well as Dolly's 2 books. So, Pandora reads a total of 1 + 2 = 3 books.

In total, they read 3 (Dolly's books) + 3 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then convert that to hours.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike receives from his remaining 3 pen pals. Since each of them sends 2 letters a week, and there are 3 of them, the total number of letters he receives is 2 * 3 = 6 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to calculate the total minutes he used for his daily calls and the extra minutes, then subtract that from his total plan minutes.

Daily calls: 15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes
Extra minutes: 300 minutes
Total minutes used: 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, subtract the total minutes used from the total plan minutes:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as 'x'. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin was left with (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27 to find the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.
7. Solving the equation 7 + x = 27, we get x = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as x. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for each day, then multiply it by the number of days, and finally multiply it by the number of weeks. 

Cost per day = $250 * 6 hours = $1500
Cost for 4 days a week = $1500 * 4 = $6000
Cost for 5 weeks = $6000 * 5 = $30,000

After the movie is done, Jean gets a 10% discount. 
Discount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3000
Total amount Jean paid = $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000

"To find out how much each person paid, we need to first calculate the total cost of the party supplies. 

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle and her two parents split the cost evenly, there are 3 people in total. 

To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3.

$96 / 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, each weighing 50 pounds. So, the total weight of onions is:
4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost is:
200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday and Tuesday, we need to calculate her sister's cookie consumption first. 

Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. 

Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, so Sue ate 5 * 4 = 20 cookies on Monday. 
Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, so Sue ate 13 * 2 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies
Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, 
Total calories consumed by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
Total calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

The difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls, the total number of girls in these two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls in the school is 50% of the total number of students. Let's denote the total number of students as 'T'. Then, 50% of T is 27. 

We can write this as 0.5T = 27. To find T, we divide both sides by 0.5: T = 27 / 0.5 = 54.

Since there are 3 classes, and each class has 20 students, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60. However, we already found that the total number of students is 54. This is a contradiction, but we can continue with the information we have.

Since the total number of students is 54, and the total number of girls is 27, the total number of boys is 54 - 27 = 27.

Since the third class has 20 students, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - (number of girls in the third class). We don't know the number of girls in the third class, but we can find it by subtracting the number of girls in the first and second classes from the total number of girls: 27 - 15 - 12 = 0.

So, the number of girls in the third class is 0. The number of boys in the third class is 20 - 0 = 20.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's represent the number of cougars killed today as 'x'. Then, the number of wolves killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12 to find the number of wolves killed today. 

Solving for x, we get x = 12 / 3 = 4. However, this is the number of cougars, not wolves. We already know that the number of wolves killed today is 3 times the number of cougars, so the number of wolves killed today is 3 * 4 = 12.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals killed. Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars, for a total of 10 + 15 = 25 animals. Today, Rick killed 12 wolves and 12 cougars, for a total of 12 + 12 = 24 animals.

The total number of animals killed is 25 + 24 = 49.

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

So, the number of cows added to each stall is 40 / 10 = 4 cows.

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8:

24 * 8 = 192

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections and then multiply it by the weight of each section. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of 8000 from the total weight. To find 30% of 8000, we multiply 8000 by 0.3: 8000 * 0.3 = 2400.

Now, we subtract 2400 from the total weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
2. Andrea has 52 apples, so Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
3. Jamal has half as many bananas as apples, so Jamal has 44 / 2 = 22 bananas.
4. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, but this is not possible since he has fewer bananas than apples. This statement seems to be incorrect or misleading. However, we can proceed with the information we have.
5. Since Jamal has 22 bananas and 44 apples, the total number of fruits Jamal has is 22 + 44 = 66.
6. Andrea has 52 apples, and we don't have any information about her bananas. However, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the fruits Jamal has to the fruits Andrea has: 52 (Andrea's apples) + 66 (Jamal's fruits) = 118.

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we first need to determine how many cups of flour are needed for each day. 

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups of flour are needed for 36 cookies. 

Since 12 cookies require 2 cups of flour, 36 cookies will require 3 times as much flour as 12 cookies. So, 36 cookies will require 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour.

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 30 cookies, we can divide 30 by 12 and multiply the result by 2. 

30 / 12 = 2.5, and 2.5 * 2 = 5 cups of flour.

Now, we need to add the cups of flour needed for both days. 6 cups (for today) + 5 cups (for tomorrow) = 11 cups of flour.

"To find the total price of the house, we need to add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee. 

The selling price is $350,000. 
The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.
The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find out how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

"To find the number of blue golf balls, we need to first find the total number of golf balls, which is half of the total balls the juggler can juggle. 

Total balls = 16
Golf balls = Total balls / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8

Since half of the golf balls are blue, we can find the number of blue golf balls by dividing the total number of golf balls by 2.

Blue golf balls = Golf balls / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

The final answer is: 762"
"To find the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

Each house has 3 bedrooms with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is 3 * 2 = 6. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12.

Each house has 4 additional windows not connected to bedrooms. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is 4 * 2 = 8.

The total number of windows in one house is 12 (bedrooms) + 8 (additional) = 20. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows is 20 * 2 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to determine the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is a 1800-stitch project, the total number of stitches used for the body and the sleeves is 1800 - 270 = 1530 stitches.

The body takes 900 stitches, so the number of stitches used for the sleeves is 1530 - 900 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

The final answer is: 315"

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, and then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to find the number of cards that do not have the letters A, B, or C.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 is (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. The remaining cards after A are 80 - 32 = 48. 1/2 of 48 is (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. The remaining cards after A and B are 48 - 24 = 24. 5/8 of 24 is (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

The number of cards with the letter D is the total number of cards minus the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C: 80 - 32 - 24 - 15 = 9.

Time for small holes: 3 minutes per hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 10 minutes per hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Total time in minutes: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we need to first find their current ages. 

Let's assume Mico's age is x and Marco's age is (20 - x), since the sum of their ages is 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be x + 10 and Marco's age will be (20 - x) + 10.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + ((20 - x) + 10).

Simplifying the expression, we get:
x + 10 + 20 - x + 10
= 40

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Sam's current age as 'S' and Ruby's current age as 'R'. 

We are given that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write an equation: R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Now, let's substitute the first equation into the second one: 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Expanding the equation, we get: 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get: 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get: 3S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: S = 6.

The final answer is: 6"

"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots per cobra: 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

Since the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras, we divide the number of spots per cobra by 2 to find the number of spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

To find the total number of spots on the mambas, we multiply the number of mambas by the number of spots per mamba: 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

Now, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas to find the combined total: 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Finally, we divide the combined total by 2 to find half the number of spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"To find out how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of people she needs to serve. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. 
Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 
The total number of people Maddy needs to serve is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas Maddy needs to buy is 39 / 3 = 13.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to first calculate the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace to find the length taken up by the sterling silver beads. 

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 of them, so the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. 

The length taken up by the sterling silver beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of beads, we divide the total length taken up by the beads by the length of each bead: 17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = 68.

"To find out how many cents Kelly has initially, we need to calculate the total value of her quarters and dimes. 

Each quarter is worth 25 cents, and she has 5 quarters, so the total value of her quarters is 5 x 25 = 125 cents. 

Each dime is worth 10 cents, and she has 2 dimes, so the total value of her dimes is 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

The total value of her coins is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, we need to subtract the cost of the pop from the total value of her coins to find out how many cents she has left.

So, 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

"To find the time taken by the car in the fast lane, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. 

Given that the car in the fast lane traveled 480 miles at 60 miles/hour, we can calculate its time as follows:
Time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours.

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, its speed is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the same formula to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane:
Time = Distance / Speed = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ali has 22 medals.
2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
4. Together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, which means they have 1/10 of the total medals given out.

Let's represent the total medals given out as 'x'. Then, 1/10 of x is equal to 39. 

To find x, we multiply both sides by 10:
x = 39 * 10
x = 390

"To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. 

There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, each containing 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

4 adults will get 6 chocolate bars each, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

The remaining chocolate bars are 40 - 24 = 16.

There are 8 children, and they will share the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally. To find out how many each child will get, we divide 16 by 8.

16 / 8 = 2

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the time to minutes first. 

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed, we need to first calculate their points after the fourth round.

Initially, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point and still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed: 
Mike has 22 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points. 
The total points of all three players is 22 + 18 + 43 = 83.

"To find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day. 

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 3 meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). So, the total rice consumption per person per day is 0.2 kg * 3 = 0.6 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total rice consumption per day is 0.6 kg * 5 = 3 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the daily consumption (3 kg).

42 kg / 3 kg/day = 14 days

Since we want to know how many weeks the rice will last, we need to convert the days to weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the number of days by 7.

14 days / 7 days/week = 2 weeks

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 2 weeks.

"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he sold bread for 5 days. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. 

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates

Since he was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 working days. His target for the week was 120 crates, but he had 2 less working days. 

To find the target for 5 working days, we need to calculate the target for 7 days and then multiply it by 5/7. 

Target for 7 days = 120 crates
Target for 5 days = 120 * (5/7) = 85.71 (approximately)

However, since we can't sell a fraction of a crate, we will round down to 85 crates for 5 working days.

Now, let's calculate how many crates Sam was off from his target for the week:

Crates off target = Target for 5 days - Total crates sold
= 85 - 65
= 20

"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carmen spent on bids. 

Carmen starts with a bid of $200. The other 3 people each bid once, so the total number of bids after them is 4 (including Carmen's initial bid). Since the bids rise by $50 each time, the total increase in the bid is 3 * $50 = $150. 

However, since Carmen bids after each of the other 3 people, she also bids 3 times. So, the total increase in the bid due to Carmen's bids is 3 * $50 = $150. 

The total increase in the bid is the sum of the increases due to the other people's bids and Carmen's bids, which is $150 + $150 = $300. 

The total cost of the desk is the initial bid plus the total increase in the bid, which is $200 + $300 = $500.

The final answer is: $500"

   He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven per year is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15000 miles.

2. Total cost of driving: He gets charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of driving per year is 15000 * $2 = $30000.

3. Total bonus paid: He gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid per year is $150 * 12 = $1800.

4. Total cost: The total cost is the sum of the total cost of driving and the total bonus paid, which is $30000 + $1800 = $31800.

When a piece of paper is folded, it creates two layers: the front and the back. 

For a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the number of pages on the front and back of each piece of paper. 

Since each piece of paper has two sides, we can print 2 pages on each piece of paper. 

To find the total number of pages, we divide the total number of pages by 2. 

32 / 2 = 16 

However, this is the number of pages that can be printed on one piece of paper. Since we need 32 pages in total, we need 32 / 2 = 16 pieces of paper."

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we need to calculate how much he has spent so far and subtract that from the total amount he has.

1. Cost of business suits: 6 suits * $100 = $600
2. Cost of suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 = $150
3. Cost of flight ticket: 5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500, then add $700 to get the total cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200
4. Total spent so far: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950
5. Subtract the amount he wishes to save from the total amount he has: $6000 - $2000 = $4000
6. Subtract the total spent so far from the remaining amount: $4000 - $1950 = $2050

"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to first find the total number of eggs consumed in a day. 

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs they consume is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs. 
The rest of the family members are 5 - 3 = 2. 
These 2 people eat 2 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs they consume is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs. 
The total number of eggs consumed in a day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs. 
Since they eat eggs every day, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
2. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
3. The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60000.
4. Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population of Chile is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

The final answer is: 120000"
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is D/2.

The total number of players on the team is 105, which is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. 

So, we can write the equation: D + 2D + D/2 = 105

To solve for D, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2D + 4D + D = 210

Combine like terms: 7D = 210

Divide both sides by 7: D = 30

The number of players on the defense is 30.

"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

2 families with 6 people: 2 * 6 = 12 people
3 families with 4 people: 3 * 4 = 12 people
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24 people

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness, and 1/4 of that number had previous commitments. 

1/4 of 8 is 8 / 4 = 2 people. 

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is 8 (due to illness) + 2 (previous commitments) = 10 people.

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited: 24 - 10 = 14 people.

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156.

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls, nongendered children, and then add them to the number of boys.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls is:
Girls = 3 * Boys = 3 * 30 = 90

Given that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, the number of nongendered children is:
Nongendered children = 1/10 * Boys = 1/10 * 30 = 3

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

1 (electric pole) : 3 (electric wires) = x (electric poles) : 45 (electric wires)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

1 * 45 = 3x
45 = 3x
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of people who left, we first need to find the total number of people at the party. 

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people is 25 + 15 = 40.

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can find the number of people who left by multiplying the total number of people by 1/4.

Number of people who left = 40 * (1/4) = 10

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 left. So, the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pencils Jam has, we know she has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. 

Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as 'x'. Since Jam has 3 boxes, the total number of pencils in the boxes is 3x. Adding the 2 loose pencils, we get the equation: 3x + 2 = 26.

To solve for 'x', we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 26 - 2, 3x = 24.

Then, we divide both sides by 3: x = 24 / 3, x = 8.

So, each box contains 8 pencils. 

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have. Jam has 26 pencils and Meg has 46 pencils, so together they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

Since each box contains 8 pencils, the total number of boxes needed to store all their pencils is 72 / 8 = 9.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and weakens it by 12 milliliters. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we need to find out how many ice cubes are required to achieve this. 

Let's assume the initial temperature of the coffee is 100 degrees (for simplicity). To cool it down to 35 degrees (100 - 65 = 35), we need to use ice cubes that cool the coffee by 13 degrees each. 

Number of ice cubes = (100 - 35) / 13 = 65 / 13 = 5

Each ice cube weakens the coffee by 12 milliliters, so 5 ice cubes will weaken it by 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters.

Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which weakens the coffee further.

Total weakening effect = 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many old records were traded for the 7 new records. Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the number of old records traded must be double the number of new records.

Let's denote the number of new records as N and the number of old records as O. We know that 5 people came in and left with 7 new records, but since the problem is asking for the total number of old records brought in, we need to consider the total number of new records traded, not just the number of new records the 5 people left with. 

However, since the 5 people left with 7 new records, and there are 5 people, we can assume that the total number of new records traded is 7 * 5 = 35. 

Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the total number of old records traded is 35 * 2 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the number of junior and senior programmers, their salaries, and then add them together.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. 
2/5 * 100 = 40 junior programmers.

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, so the total amount paid to junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so they are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

The total amount paid to senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount paid to all programmers is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

"Let's break down the information given:

- At the first bus stop, 5 people got in.
- At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 people got in.
- After the second bus stop, there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop.

We can represent the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'. 

Initially, there were 'x' people on the bus. 
At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total became x + 5.
At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.
Then, 8 people got in, so the total became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that after the second bus stop, there were 20 people heading to the third stop. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
x + 6 = 20

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
x = 20 - 6
x = 14

2. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first find out how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can find the time it takes to charge 40% by multiplying 40 by 3. 

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To determine which job pays more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

Job A: 
- Gross income: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year
- Tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B: 
- Gross income: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income before tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Since $32,400 is less than $24,000, Job A pays more. To find the difference, we subtract the net income of Job B from the net income of Job A:
$24,000 - $32,400 = -$8,400

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Since the smallest group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from x:

70 - 10 = 60

"Let's break down the information given:

- Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total.
- He has twice as many chickens as cows.

Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as 2C (since he has twice as many chickens as cows).

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

C + 2C = 60

Combine like terms:

3C = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

C = 20

So, there are 20 cows and 2C = 40 chickens.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs:

- Each cow has 4 legs, so 20 cows have 20 x 4 = 80 legs.
- Each chicken has 2 legs, so 40 chickens have 40 x 2 = 80 legs.

"To solve this problem, let's start by using the information given about the pink frog. We know that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds. 

Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog also weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all the animals: 
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

To find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, we need to add the weight of the animals and the weight of the container. 

Total weight = weight of pink frog + weight of blue beetle + weight of green toad + weight of yellow snake + weight of red bird + weight of the container
Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: 
$36 (initial amount) - $15 (total spent) = $21

Andrea saved $21."
"To find the total time John spent, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them up.

Time spent boating: 6 hours
Time spent swimming: 6 / 2 = 3 hours
Time spent watching shows: 3 shows * 2 hours per show = 6 hours
Total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours

Since watching shows was 30% of the total time, we can set up the equation: 30% of total time = 15 hours
To find the total time, we can convert 30% to a decimal by dividing by 100: 30 / 100 = 0.3
Now we can set up the equation: 0.3 * total time = 15
To find the total time, we can divide both sides by 0.3: total time = 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours

Since John spent 40% of his time sightseeing, we can find the time spent sightseeing by multiplying the total time by 0.4: time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has in her savings.

From her first job, she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours of work, so her earnings from the first job are:
$10/hour * 20 hours = $200

From her second job, she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours of work, so her earnings from the second job are:
$5/hour * 15 hours = $75

Her total earnings from both jobs are:
$200 + $75 = $275

She already has $80 in her savings, so the total amount she has is:
$275 (earnings) + $80 (savings) = $355

To find out how much money she still needs to save, we subtract the total amount she has from the cost of the phone:
$400 (phone cost) - $355 (total amount she has) = $45

The final answer is: $45"
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the combined height of the two shorter trees. 

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. 
The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

The combined height of the two shorter trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The tallest tree is twice the height of the two shorter trees combined, so its height is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is 34 feet."
"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money he spent and then add the extra $10 his mother gave him.

First, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on toy cars: 
6 toy cars * $2 per toy car = $12

Next, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on teddy bears: 
5 teddy bears * $1 per teddy bear = $5

Now, let's add the total amount Dean spent on toy cars and teddy bears: 
$12 + $5 = $17

Dean started with $28 and spent $17, so he has $28 - $17 = $11 left.

His mother then gave him an extra $10, so we add that to the $11 he already had: 
$11 + $10 = $21

The final answer is: $21"
"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is $5 per person. Since she wants to play one round, the cost is $5 per person. 
The cost of arcade tokens is $5.
The cost of go-karts is $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice, so the cost is $20 per person.

Let's assume the number of friends she invites is x. The total cost for her and her friends will be:
5(x + 1) + 5 + 20(x + 1) = 90

Combine like terms:
5x + 5 + 20x + 20 = 90
25x + 25 = 90

Subtract 25 from both sides:
25x = 65

Divide both sides by 25:
x = 65 / 25
x = 2.6

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can invite 2 friends and still have some money left over, but if we want to know the maximum number of friends she can invite, we'll round down to 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to first calculate how much money she spends on lollipops each day and then subtract that from her daily pocket money. 

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day and buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lollipops: 
4 lollipops * 25 cents = 100 cents or $1

Now, let's subtract the cost of the lollipops from her daily pocket money: 
$5 - $1 = $4

Since she saves the change for 5 days, we multiply the daily savings by 5: 
$4 * 5 = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we first need to determine how much money he had left after buying the candy. 

Billy started with $10. He spent an unknown amount on candy. Let's call the amount of candy he bought 'x' pounds. The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound, so the total cost of the candy is 1.5x dollars. 

Since he had $10 initially, the amount of money he had left after buying the candy is 10 - 1.5x.

He then took half of this amount and spent it on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2. 

The amount of money he spent on gumballs is half of the money he had left after buying the candy, which is (10 - 1.5x) / 2. Since this is equal to the cost of the gumballs ($2), we can set up the equation:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

10 - 1.5x = 4

Now, we can isolate x by subtracting 10 from both sides:

-1.5x = -6

Dividing both sides by -1.5 gives us:

x = 4

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy. 

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. We are given that C = 45. We are also given that C = 2S - 5. 

We can substitute the value of C into the second equation: 45 = 2S - 5.

To solve for S, we need to isolate S on one side of the equation. First, we add 5 to both sides: 45 + 5 = 2S - 5 + 5, which simplifies to 50 = 2S.

Next, we divide both sides by 2: 50 / 2 = 2S / 2, which simplifies to 25 = S.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the three cities. 

Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
Distance from the third city to the first city: 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs)
Total distance in one trip: 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is:
225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles/day

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the distance it travels in a day (675 miles):
18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days

So, the train goes approximately 26.67 days between services."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds, we need to find the average of the stuffing needed for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds. 

The average is calculated by adding the two values and dividing by 2. 

Average stuffing for collie beds = (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua and collie beds. 

For 4 chihuahua beds: 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.
For 3 collie beds: 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Total amount of stuffing needed = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"To find the total distance John drove, we need to add the original distance to his friend's house, the detour, and the distance back home. 

Distance to friend's house = 200 miles
Detour = 10 miles
Distance back home = 240 miles
Total distance = 200 + 10 + 240 = 450 miles

Now, we need to find the time it took for each part of the trip and add them together.

Time to drive to friend's house = Distance / Speed = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.86 hours (approximately)
Time for the detour = 10 miles / 70 mph = 0.14 hours (approximately)
Time to drive back home = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Total time = 2.86 + 0.14 + 3 = 5.99 hours (approximately)

"Let's break down the information given:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S. 
   We can write the equation: S = 4 * 3 - 5
   S = 12 - 5
   S = 7
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V. 
   We can write the equation: V = 3 * S
   V = 3 * 7
   V = 21
4. If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, we can write the equation: 
   Total = 3 (refusing to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) + X (other reasons)
   50 = 3 + 7 + 21 + X
   50 = 31 + X
   X = 50 - 31
   X = 19

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

Since making it DIY saves 20%, we can calculate the materials cost as follows:

Materials cost = Original cost - (Original cost * 20%)
Materials cost = $400 - ($400 * 0.20)
Materials cost = $400 - $80
Materials cost = $320

So, the total cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper is $320."

"To find the total profit per hour, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she bought enough supplies to make 3 pitchers, she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue will be 36 * $1 = $36.

Now, let's find the profit. The initial cost was $18. So, the profit will be $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we need to find the profit per hour. To do this, we divide the profit by the number of cups sold per hour. However, the profit is already calculated for the total amount of lemonade, not per hour. So, we need to find the profit per hour by dividing the profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade. 

To find the number of hours, we divide the total number of cups by the cups sold per hour: 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his initial land. We know that 2/5 of his initial land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2 to isolate x:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu. 

First, let's find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu

"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to find out how many popsicles each of them has. 

Let's assume the number of popsicles Betty has is 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has is 6x. 

Since the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can write the equation: 5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms: 11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11: x = 15

Now that we know x, we can find the number of popsicles each of them has. Betty has 5x = 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles. Sam has 6x = 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15

"To find the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. 

The normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $20. 

Since Tim saves 20% by bundling, we need to find 20% of $20. 
20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, he saves $60 - $26 = $34 by cancelling his cable subscription.

6 rows * 6 columns = 36 spaces

Next, we need to find double the number of books in the shelving system. 

Double the number of books = 2 * 36 = 72

Then, we need to add 20 more books to the double the number of books.

Total number of books = 72 + 20 = 92

So, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

The final answer is: 92"
"To find out how many Valentine's cards Erica has now, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, added to the cards her dad brought, and then subtract the cards she passed out and add the cards she received.

Initially, Erica made 20 Valentine's cards.

Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each, so 2 * 15 = 30 cards.

She initially had 20 cards, and her dad brought 30, so 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

She had 50 cards initially, passed out 29, so 50 - 29 = 21 cards left.

She received 17 cards from family and friends, so 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find out how many slices Jenny gave to Bill and Mark, we need to calculate 1/3 and 1/4 of the total slices.

1/3 of 12 slices is 12 * (1/3) = 4 slices.
1/4 of 12 slices is 12 * (1/4) = 3 slices.

So, Bill got 4 slices and Mark got 3 slices. Jenny gave away a total of 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so the total slices left are 12 - 7 - 2 = 3 slices.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many days Mark needs to save his money, we need to divide the cost of the bike by his daily earnings.

Cost of the bike: $300
Daily earnings: $10

Number of days = Cost of the bike / Daily earnings
= $300 / $10
= 30

So, Mark needs to save his money for 30 days to buy the bike.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Number of spiders: 90
Number of millipedes: 1/3rd of 90 = 90 / 3 = 30
Number of stink bugs: 2 * 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48

Total number of bugs: 90 (spiders) + 30 (millipedes) + 48 (stink bugs) = 168

The final answer is: 168"
"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we first need to find Alice's age. 

Since Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, we can calculate Beth's age as follows:
Beth's age = Erica's age + 5
Beth's age = 30 + 5
Beth's age = 35

Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, we can calculate Alice's age as follows:
Alice's age = Beth's age + 7
Alice's age = 35 + 7
Alice's age = 42

Now, we can find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica:
Difference = Alice's age - Erica's age
Difference = 42 - 30
Difference = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total calories consumed by John, we need to calculate the total ounces of milk he drank and then multiply it by the calories per ounce.

John drank 2 glasses of milk, and each glass is 8 ounces. So, the total ounces of milk he drank is 2 * 8 = 16 ounces.

Since milk has 3 calories per ounce, the total calories consumed by John is 16 * 3 = 48 calories.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find out how much the builder earns in a year, we need to calculate his daily earnings, then multiply it by the number of days he works in a year.

First, let's find out how many days he works in a year. He works 4 weeks every month, and there are 12 months in a year. 

Number of weeks worked in a year = 4 weeks/month * 12 months/year = 48 weeks/year

Since he works 6 days a week, the total number of days he works in a year is:
Total days worked in a year = 48 weeks/year * 6 days/week = 288 days/year

Now, let's find out his daily earnings:
Daily earnings = $50/day

Now, we can find out his total earnings in a year:
Total earnings in a year = Daily earnings * Total days worked in a year
Total earnings in a year = $50/day * 288 days/year
Total earnings in a year = $14400/year

The final answer is: $14400"
"To find out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, he needs 4 times the amount of each ingredient. 

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs to buy:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs to buy:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the energy used by the air conditioner per day. 

The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Since there are 8 hours of usage per day, the energy used per day is:
900 watts/hour * 8 hours/day = 7200 watts/day

Since there are 1000 watts in 1 kilowatt, we can convert the energy used per day to kilowatts:
7200 watts/day / 1000 = 7.2 kilowatts/day

If Mel reduces the usage time by 5 hours, the new usage time per day is:
8 hours/day - 5 hours/day = 3 hours/day

The energy used per day with the reduced usage time is:
900 watts/hour * 3 hours/day = 2700 watts/day

Converting this to kilowatts:
2700 watts/day / 1000 = 2.7 kilowatts/day

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original energy used and the new energy used:
7.2 kilowatts/day - 2.7 kilowatts/day = 4.5 kilowatts/day

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30:
4.5 kilowatts/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatts

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the average number of stripes, we need to calculate the total number of stripes and divide it by the total number of zebras.

There are 2 zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.
There is 1 zebra with 36 stripes.
There is 1 zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

The total number of stripes is 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.
The total number of zebras is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

The average number of stripes is 88 / 4 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required and then multiply it by their respective costs.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we need to find out how many sandwiches are required to serve 20 people.

Number of people = 20
Number of people per sandwich = 4
Number of sandwiches required = 20 / 4 = 5

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, the total amount of meat and cheese required is also 5 pounds each.

Cost of meat per pound = $7.00
Cost of cheese per pound = $3.00
Total amount of meat required = 5 pounds
Total amount of cheese required = 5 pounds

Total cost of meat = 5 pounds * $7.00/pound = $35.00
Total cost of cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00/pound = $15.00

Total cost = Total cost of meat + Total cost of cheese = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"To find the initial number of corns, we know that there are twice as many corns as cannolis. Since Allan has 40 cannolis, the initial number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, he bought 60 cannolis and 60 - 40 = 20 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he bought 60 cannolis, the number of corns he bought is 60 - 20 = 40.

Now, we add the initial number of corns and cannolis to the number of corns and cannolis Allan bought. The total number of corns is 80 + 40 = 120. The total number of cannolis is 40 + 60 = 100.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 120 + 100 = 220."
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before the jog. 

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, before the jog, Elliott completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after the jog, we can subtract the steps he completed before the jog from the total steps he wants to take. 

10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps before jog) = 4,000 steps left, but he only had 2,000 steps left after the jog. This means that the 4,000 steps left must be the steps he took during the jog, plus the 2,000 steps he had left. 

So, 4,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps.

The final answer is: 2,000"
"To find out how many minutes it will take Toby to read the book, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book and then divide it by his reading speed.

Total words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Time taken to read the book = Total words / reading speed = 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Since it takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, Toby will be at the airport in 30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes.

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, so to find out how many minutes early he will be, we subtract the time he will arrive from the time he has to be there:

Time early = 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees left is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

The final answer is: $168,000"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds and the first pound is full price, the second pound is half off. The cost of the first pound is $3, and the cost of the second pound is $3 / 2 = $1.50. So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. She bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount spent by Tim, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework.

The first package of fireworks costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
20% of $1200 is 0.2 * $1200 = $240.

The discount amount is subtracted from the total cost of the fireworks: $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150.

The total amount spent by Tim is the sum of the discounted fireworks and the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate how many cookies she will eat in 30 days. 

Since Shannon eats 2 cookies a night, and there are 30 days in the period, she will eat 2 * 30 = 60 cookies in 30 days.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she will eat by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make. 

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5 dozens.

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two events. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50000 candles smell like wet dog, so the number of candles that smell like wet dog is 0.05 * 50000 = 2500.

Next, we need to find the number of candles that are more dangerous and have a defect. Since 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, 1% of the candles are more dangerous and have a defect. The number of candles that are more dangerous is 0.01 * 50000 = 500.

However, the 500 candles that are more dangerous include the 2500 candles that smell like wet dog. To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two events. Since the 2500 candles that smell like wet dog are a subset of the 500 candles that are more dangerous, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 2500.

The final answer is: 2500"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount amount is 30% of the regular price, which is 0.3 x $20 = $6. 

So, the discounted price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 x $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The average trees are not specified, so let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as 'x'.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 45 + x.
The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can set up the equation: (45 + x) + 105 = 500.

Simplifying the equation: 45 + x + 105 = 500
Combine like terms: 150 + x = 500
Subtract 150 from both sides: x = 350

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We know that the total number of heads is 180, so we can write an equation based on this information:

C + D = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps (humps) is 304. Since camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each, we can write another equation:

2C + D = 304

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system by subtracting the first equation from the second equation to eliminate D:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the information given:

1. Distance traveled in the first 4 days: 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km
2. Distance traveled over the next two days: 30% of 800 km = 0.3 * 800 = 240 km
   Total distance traveled in the first 6 days = 800 km + 240 km = 1040 km
3. Distance traveled on the next day: 0 km (he wasn't traveling)
4. Distance traveled during the second week: 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, we add up the distances traveled in the first week and the second week:
Total distance = 1040 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from Peter's locker size. 

Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can find Zack's locker size by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4. 

Zack's locker size = 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches.

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can find Timothy's locker size by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 20 * 2 = 40 cubic inches.

1. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20.
3. Now, the number of cats left on the rock is 50 - 20 = 30.
4. 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran, we multiply 3/5 by 30: (3/5) * 30 = 18.
5. The number of cats left on the rock is the remaining cats minus the cats that ran after the mouse: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different periods and calculate the cost for each period.

1. The first 6 months cost $8 per month, so the total cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.
2. The next 8 months cost $12 per month, so the total cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.
3. The remaining months in 2 years (24 months) minus the first 14 months (6 + 8) is 24 - 14 = 10 months. The cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, we add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. 
   Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J. 
   We can write the equation: J = T - 6.

2. The total savings is $6. 
   Since Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 2/3 from the tattered jeans. 
   We can write the equation: (1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6.

3. Substitute J from the first equation into the second equation: 
   (1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6.

4. Multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 
   T - 6 + 2T = 18.

5. Combine like terms: 
   3T - 6 = 18.

6. Add 6 to both sides of the equation: 
   3T = 24.

7. Divide both sides of the equation by 3: 
   T = 8.

8. Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans (T = 8), we can find the cost of the jogger jeans (J = T - 6): 
   J = 8 - 6 = 2.

9. The jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each. Since Lillian bought 3 of these, they attract a total of 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

The feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. Since she made 3 of these, they attract a total of 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

To find the total number of birds, we add the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders and the homemade feeders: 60 + 90 = 150.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how many cards he sold. Since he has $50 in spending cash and the ticket costs $100, he needs to make $50 from selling the cards. 

Since each card is sold for $1.5, we can calculate the number of cards he sold by dividing the amount he needs ($50) by the price per card ($1.5).

Number of cards sold = $50 / $1.5 = 33.33 (round down to 33 since you can't sell a fraction of a card)

However, Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, which means he sold 2/3 of the cards. Let's represent the total number of cards as 'x'. 

2/3 * x = 33.33

To find 'x', we can multiply both sides by 3/2.

x = 33.33 * (3/2)
x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards. 

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. Since there are 36 guests, half of them is 36 / 2 = 18. So, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 18 guests to have two hotdogs.

2. This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs for the 18 guests who would have two hotdogs.

3. Since the caterer prepared 36 hotdogs for 18 guests, and each guest gets one hotdog, the remaining hotdogs are also for the 18 guests. So, the total number of hotdogs prepared is 36 (for the first hotdog) + 18 (for the second hotdog) = 54 hotdogs.

4. However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means 40 guests will have two hotdogs each, which is 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

5. Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, and 80 hotdogs are needed, there are not enough hotdogs for everyone to have a second hotdog.

6. To find out how many guests did not get a second hotdog, we need to find out how many hotdogs are left after 40 guests have one hotdog each. Since 40 guests have one hotdog each, 40 hotdogs are used. This leaves 54 - 40 = 14 hotdogs.

7. Since each guest needs a second hotdog, and there are 14 hotdogs left, 14 guests can have a second hotdog.

8. The number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is the total number of guests minus the number of guests who got a second hotdog. So, 40 - 14 = 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: 26"

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

1. Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:
- Set of pot and pans: $120.00
- Set of mixing bowls: $20.00
- 5 separate utensils: 5 x $5.00 = $25.00
Total cost before discount: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

2. Calculate the discount:
Discount = 20% of $165.00
Discount = 0.20 x $165.00
Discount = $33.00

3. Calculate the total cost after the discount:
Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount
Total cost after discount = $165.00 - $33.00
Total cost after discount = $132.00

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19

Dora has a total of $2 (her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18

Now, let's subtract the amount of money Dora has from the total cost of the items: $19 (total cost) - $18 (Dora's money) = $1

Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to first determine how many dragons Prince Arthur and Prince Walter slew, and then calculate one-fifth of that number.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. 
Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so Prince Arthur slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so Prince Bruce slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to find out how much gas was in one container. 

15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, so each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons of gas.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we can convert 3 gallons to pints by multiplying 3 by 8. 

3 * 8 = 24 pints

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so we need to find 1/4 of 24 pints. 

1/4 * 24 = 6 pints

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George had initially. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, he must have spent 99% of his money. 

Let's assume George had x dollars initially. Then, 99% of x is equal to $5. 

0.99x = 5

To find x, we can divide both sides by 0.99:

x = 5 / 0.99
x = 5.05

So, George had $5.05 initially. 

Now, let's find out how much he spent on chips. He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so the total cost of chips is:

3 * 0.40 = $1.20

Since he spent $5 in total, the amount he spent on candy bars is:

5 - 1.20 = $3.80

Now, let's find out how many candy bars he bought. Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is:

3.80 / 0.75 = 5.07

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 5 candy bars with $3.75 and have $1.05 left, which is more than enough to buy 1 candy bar. Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to subtract the lollipops he kept from the total and then divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5, so the number of lollipops he shared is 25 - 5 = 20.

He shared these 20 lollipops with 4 friends, so each friend received 20 / 4 = 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the remaining weight of the cake, we need to first find out how much the two pieces that Rory and her mom had weigh. 

Since the cake weighs 20 ounces and it's cut into 8 pieces, each piece weighs 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces. 

Rory and her mom each have a piece, so together they have 2.5 * 2 = 5 ounces of cake. 

Now, to find the remaining weight of the cake, we subtract the weight of the two pieces from the total weight: 20 - 5 = 15 ounces.

"To find out how many oranges each person will get, we need to first find the total number of oranges they have together. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

They are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, including themselves, so the total number of people sharing the oranges is 8 (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people
= 56 / 8
= 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and divide it by the number of servings.

Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to determine how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then add 5 minutes to that time.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne's arrival time. Since Wayne arrives in 4 minutes, Bernadette needs to leave 4 - 5 = -1 minutes before Wayne's arrival time. However, since Bernadette can't leave before Wayne, we need to calculate how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne.

Since Bernadette's drive is 16 minutes, and she needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave 16 - 5 = 11 minutes before Wayne's arrival time. 

So Bernadette should leave 11 minutes before Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. Since the area of the room is given as 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. 

1 yard = 3 feet
So, 3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:
Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula:
Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads they bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Difference in beads = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
= 140 - 60
= 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

The oven is on for 3 hours, and it raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase due to the oven is 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.

The window is open for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open, so the total temperature decrease due to the open window is (0.5 / 0.1) * 2 = 10 degrees.

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. The temperature increase due to the oven is 15 degrees, and the temperature decrease due to the open window is 10 degrees. 

So, the final temperature of the house is 40 + 15 - 10 = 45 degrees.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the time it took James to do the run, we first need to find the total time it took James to complete the triathlon. 

First, let's convert Jon's times to minutes: 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's find James' time for the swim. James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. 
10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. 
So, James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

James' bike time is 5 minutes longer than Jon's, so it is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, we can find James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time: 
180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

The final answer is: 59"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then divide it by 4.

Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to calculate the distance it runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, we need to convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 

Distance = Speed * Time = 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to calculate the number of eggs in the dozen cases and add the loose eggs. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so to find out how many glasses Rozanne can make, we divide the total number of eggs by 5. 

50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out.

10 glasses / 5 glasses per tray = 2 trays.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday:
17 sneakers were sold for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 x $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sale to the department store:
The salesman had 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.
These were sold for $25 each, so the revenue from the department store sale is:
31 x $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store sale:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The initial cost of the case of sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The number of crayons in the packets with 8 pieces is 6 * 8 = 48.
The number of crayons in the packets with 16 pieces is 4 * 16 = 64.

Now, we add the number of crayons in both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

The final answer is: 112"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra.
2. The regular price of a soda is $3.
3. If you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2, it means the total cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda without the super ticket is $20 - $2 = $18.

Since the super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra, the cost of the movie ticket alone is $20 - $1 = $19. 

Now, let's consider the cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a soda and popcorn at regular price. The total cost in this case is $12 (movie ticket) + $3 (soda) + x (popcorn price) = $18 (total cost without the super ticket).

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

12 + 3 + x = 18

Combine like terms:

15 + x = 18

Subtract 15 from both sides:

x = 3

The regular price of popcorn is $3."
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to find the original cost per balloon. 

Let's denote the original cost per balloon as x. The total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, so we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So the original cost per balloon was $45. Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, making the new cost per balloon $65.

Now, we can find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price:

Total cost = 170 * 65
Total cost = 11,050

The final answer is: $11,050"

Total distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average speed = 50 mph

"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies separately and then add them together.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires is:
8 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $6400

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she now has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.
The value of the 3 sapphires she traded is:
3 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $2400

The value of the 2 rubies she received is:
2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400

Now, we add the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received:
$6400 (sapphires) + $2400 (value of traded sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $11200

The total value of Jenna's jewels is $11200.

The final answer is: $11200"
"To find the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day, so together they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is length x width x height = 8 x 2 x 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 x 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the total number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost will be 160 x $12 = $1920.

"To find the total number of cards, we first need to determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of red cards = 15
60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. 
Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 
Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the weight of each type of feed and add them together.

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Total weight of feed = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips.

Number of trips = Total weight of feed / Truck's capacity
= 3400 / 2250
= 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda a week. Since an aluminum can is worth 2 cents, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles of water a week. Since a plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

In a four-week month, Grayson's total earnings from aluminum cans are 6 * 4 = 24 cents.

In a four-week month, Grayson's total earnings from plastic bottles are 15 * 4 = 60 cents.

"To find the total number of pencils used, we first need to find the total number of pencils initially available. Since there are 30 students and each student started with 10 pencils, the total number of pencils is 30 * 10 = 300.

1/5 of the total pencils were used after two months. So, the number of pencils used is 1/5 * 300 = 60.

The remaining pencils after two months are 300 - 60 = 240.

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, the number of pencils left is 1/3 * 240 = 80.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as (x/2) + 2.

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation: (x/2) + 2 = 5.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. First, subtract 2 from both sides: (x/2) = 5 - 2, which simplifies to (x/2) = 3.

Next, multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: x = 3 * 2, which simplifies to x = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we'll convert the remoras' length from inches to feet. 

1 foot = 12 inches
6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet

There are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. 

Combined length of remoras = 1 foot
Length of shark = 10 feet

Percentage = (Combined length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of students, we need to first find the number of students who have a desktop computer and then add the number of students who do not have a desktop computer.

Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. 

Let's assume the total number of students is x. Then, one-fourth of x is equal to 20.

x/4 = 20

To find x, we multiply both sides by 4:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

"To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and coupon applied.

First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors at the sale price. Since it's buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Now, let's apply the $2.00 coupon to the cost of 1 pack. The new cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since Heather buys 2 packs, but only pays for 1 pack, the total cost is $2.00.

Now, let's find the number of razors in 2 packs. 2 packs * 4 razors per pack = 8 razors.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to divide the total cost by the number of razors. The total cost is $2.00, and there are 8 razors. 

First, we need to convert the total cost to cents. $2.00 * 100 cents/dollar = 200 cents.

"Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, the number of insects David found is B/2. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so the number of insects Lily found is (B/2) + 7.

We are also given that together they collected 43 insects. So, the sum of the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. 

We can write the equation as: B + (B/2) + ((B/2) + 7) = 43

Combine like terms: B + B + 7 = 43

Combine like terms: 2B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: B/2 = 18/2 = 9

Since Lily found 7 more than David, the number of insects Lily found is 9 + 7 = 16.

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar spent. 

A 2 x 4 gives 200 sticks for $4, so the cost per stick is $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick.
A 2 x 8 gives 400 sticks for $6, so the cost per stick is $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick.

Since a 2 x 8 gives more sticks per dollar, we will use this type of wood. 

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with $24: 
$24 / $6 = 4

3. Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner.
   - 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48.
   - The amount of money Ali has left after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To find out how long Royce takes, we first need to determine how long it takes Rob to shingle a house in minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we convert 2 hours to minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.

Since Royce takes double the time it takes Rob plus 40 minutes, we can set up the equation: Royce's time = (2 * Rob's time) + 40 minutes. 

Substituting Rob's time (120 minutes) into the equation, we get: Royce's time = (2 * 120) + 40 = 240 + 40 = 280 minutes.

The final answer is: 280"
"To find the total number of skeins of wool needed, we need to calculate the total for each item and then add them together.

For each child, Martha needs:
- 2 skeins for a hat
- 4 skeins for a scarf
- 12 skeins for a sweater
- 1 skein for a pair of mittens
- 2 skeins for a pair of socks

Total for each child: 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 19 skeins

Since there are 3 children, we multiply the total for one child by 3:
19 skeins * 3 = 57 skeins

The final answer is: 57"
"To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to calculate the total number of problems he completed and subtract that from the total number of problems.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems.
On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.
So, in total, Chris completed 12 + 36 = 48 problems on Monday and Tuesday.

The total number of problems is 100. Chris completed 48 problems, so he has 100 - 48 = 52 problems left.

On Wednesday, Chris completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

Now, we need to subtract the problems he completed on Wednesday from the remaining problems: 52 - 13 = 39.

Therefore, Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday. 

The final answer is: 39"
"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to calculate the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour and add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour: 
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

The final answer is: 29"
"To find the total number of loaves left, we need to subtract the number of loaves sold and the number of loaves returned from the initial number of loaves baked.

Initial number of loaves baked: 200
Number of loaves sold in the morning: 93
Number of loaves sold in the afternoon: 39
Total number of loaves sold: 93 + 39 = 132
Number of loaves returned: 6

Total number of loaves left = Initial number of loaves - Total number of loaves sold - Number of loaves returned
Total number of loaves left = 200 - 132 - 6
Total number of loaves left = 62

The final answer is: 62"
"To find the number of rows of red tulips, we need to divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row. 

Number of red tulips = 36
Number of tulips per row = 6
Number of rows of red tulips = 36 / 6 = 6

To find the number of rows of blue tulips, we need to divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

Number of blue tulips = 24
Number of tulips per row = 8
Number of rows of blue tulips = 24 / 8 = 3

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips. 

The total number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant is 6 + 3 = 9."
"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to first determine how many cups of raisins she has available for the oatmeal cookies. 

Since she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, she will have 1/3 of the raisins for each. 

1/3 of 27 cups of raisins is 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we need to divide 9 cups by 3/4 to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make.

To divide 9 by 3/4, we can multiply 9 by the reciprocal of 3/4, which is 4/3.

9 * (4/3) = 9 * 4 / 3 = 36 / 3 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device, then find the difference.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption is 12 * 24 = 288 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day. 

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. Her daily consumption will be 14 * 24 = 336 kWh per day.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. 

Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly consumption is 288 * 7 = 2016 kWh. 

After adding the new device, her weekly consumption is 336 * 7 = 2352 kWh.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kWh. 

Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly bill is 2016 * $1.50 = $3024.

After adding the new device, Ada's weekly bill is 2352 * $1.50 = $3528.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $3528 - $3024 = $504.

The final answer is: $504"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it would take one person to paint a whole house. 

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take them 10 days to paint a whole house (since it would take twice as long to paint the entire house).

Now, we need to convert the time from days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 10 days would be 10 x 24 = 240 hours.

Since one person would take 240 hours to paint a whole house, we need to divide this time by the number of people to find out how long it would take 5 people to paint the house. 

240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:
Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so she has 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture.
Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so she has 64 + 66 = 130 pieces of furniture.
The total number of sofas and chairs they have is 42 + 130 = 172.

The final answer is: 172"
"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we first need to find out how many CDs he could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set. 

Let's first find out how much money Tom spent on the headphone set. 

Total money spent = $48
Money spent on CD = $4
Money spent on headphone set = Total money spent - Money spent on CD
Money spent on headphone set = $48 - $4
Money spent on headphone set = $44

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set.

Money spent on headphone set = $44
Money spent on one CD = $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought with the money spent on headphone set = Money spent on headphone set / Money spent on one CD
Number of CDs that could have been bought with the money spent on headphone set = $44 / $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought with the money spent on headphone set = 11

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the total money he had.

Total money = $48
Money spent on one CD = $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought with the total money = Total money / Money spent on one CD
Number of CDs that could have been bought with the total money = $48 / $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought with the total money = 12

Now, let's find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

Number of CDs that could have been bought with the total money = 12
Number of CDs that could have been bought with the money spent on headphone set = 11
Number of more CDs that could have been bought = Number of CDs that could have been bought with the total money - Number of CDs that could have been bought with the money spent on headphone set
Number of more CDs that could have been bought = 12 - 11
Number of more CDs that could have been bought = 1

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours spent in the weeks where he worked out 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours.

First, let's find the total hours spent in the weeks where he worked out 4 hours. Since there are 8 weeks, and he worked out 4 hours in 6 of those weeks, the total hours spent in those weeks is 6 * 4 = 24 hours.

Next, let's find the total hours spent in the weeks where he worked out 5 hours. He worked out 5 hours for 2 consecutive weeks, so the total hours spent in those weeks is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

Finally, let's find the total hours spent in the week where he worked out 6 hours. He worked out 6 hours in 1 week, so the total hours spent in that week is 1 * 6 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the total hours spent in all the weeks: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours.

The total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40."
"To find the number of passengers after the second stop, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus, so 5 * 8 = 40 people get in. 
Now, the total number of passengers is:
40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 3 times 21 is 63, but since it's 3 times fewer, we subtract 63 from 21 to get the number of passengers who got in, which is 21 - 63 = -42. However, since you can't have a negative number of passengers, this means that fewer than 21 people got in.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.
   Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years.
   So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.
3. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, let's find the difference in their current ages: 
Current age of Jame = 22 years
Current age of his cousin = 47 years
Difference in their ages = 47 - 22 = 25 years

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to find the cost of the printer. Since the computer cost $1,100 and the printer cost $400 less, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.

Since Errol bought the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400, the total cost of the 2 monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2: $600 / 2 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we first need to determine the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Since there are 10 boys (half of 20 kids) and each boy brought 60 shells, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + (4 * 600) seashells. 

First, we calculate 4 times the number of seashells brought by the boys: 4 * 600 = 2400.

Then, we add the number of seashells brought by the boys to this: 600 + 2400 = 3000.

Since there are 10 girls (half of 20 kids), we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by 10 to find out how many seashells each girl brought: 3000 / 10 = 300.

The final answer is: 300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Nick had twice as many candies as George. Let's say George had x candies. Then, Nick had 2x candies.
2. George ate 5 candies, so now George has x - 5 candies left.
3. We are given that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 3
4. Solving for x, we get: x = 8
5. Since Nick had 2x candies initially, and x = 8, Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Anne's age, we need to first find Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6 years.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188

The final answer is: 188"

You ended up paying $60."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The eldest boy's initial share is $18 / 3 = $6.
2. He added $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11.
3. He added another $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.
4. He spent $8, so he now has $21 - $8 = $13.
5. He tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8, so he now has $13 * 3 = $39.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Elvis needs to save in total for the first half of the month. 

Since April has 30 days, the first half of the month will have 15 days. Let's assume Elvis saves x dollars per day in the first half. 

The total amount saved in the first half will be 15x.

In the second half, Elvis wants to save twice as much daily as he saves in the first half, so he will save 2x dollars per day.

The total number of days in the second half is also 15.

The total amount saved in the second half will be 15 * 2x = 30x.

The total amount saved in the month is the sum of the amounts saved in the first and second halves, which is 15x + 30x = 45x.

Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125, so we can set up the equation:

45x = 1125

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 45:

x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

This is the amount Elvis needs to save per day in the first half of the month. 

Since he needs to save twice as much in the second half, the amount he needs to save per day in the second half is 2x = 2 * 25 = 50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the total cost of the fruits, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them will get and then find the difference.

Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, and he finished 20 tasks. 
Jairus' total earnings = 0.8 * 20 = $16

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, and she finished 20 tasks. 
Jenny's total earnings = 0.5 * 20 = $10

Now, let's find the difference between Jairus' and Jenny's earnings:
Difference = Jairus' total earnings - Jenny's total earnings
Difference = 16 - 10
Difference = 6

"Let's denote the amount Brad gets as x. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x.

The total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars, so the sum of what Jeff and Brad get is 100. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

The final answer is: $80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works.

Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the total miles he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 = 6 miles.

Since he works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

"This is a classic example of exponential growth, specifically a geometric progression. 

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 
In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so there are 3 * 3 = 9 new families notified. 
In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so there are 9 * 3 = 27 new families notified. 
In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so there are 27 * 3 = 81 new families notified.

The total number of families notified during the fourth round of calls is 81."
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and then add that to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight he lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Now, we add the total weight lost to his final weight to find his initial weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first determine the total number of toys in the larger play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys and the larger play set is five times larger, we can calculate the total number of toys in the larger play set as follows:

Total toys in larger play set = 5 * 80 = 400

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys to have enough to make a play set five times larger than James's, we can set up an equation to represent this situation:

Number of toys Jonathan currently has + 2 = Total toys in larger play set

Let's represent the number of toys Jonathan currently has as 'x'. Then the equation becomes:

x + 2 = 400

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys. 

The final answer is: 398"

"To find out how long Ray takes to swim a mile in warm water, we need to calculate twice the time it takes him to swim a mile in cold water and add 2 minutes to it. 

Time to swim a mile in cold water = 16 minutes
Twice the time to swim a mile in cold water = 2 * 16 = 32 minutes
Time to swim a mile in warm water = 32 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold and warm water.

Time to swim 3 miles in cold water = 3 * 16 = 48 minutes
Time to swim 3 miles in warm water = 3 * 34 = 102 minutes

"To find out how many cups Juan needs to reduce, we first need to determine how many cups he currently drinks. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, and Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, we need to know the daily recommended amount of coffee.

Let's assume the daily recommended amount of coffee is x cups. Since Octavia drinks half of this, she drinks x/2 cups. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of Octavia, he drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

We are given that the daily recommended amount of coffee is 4 cups. So, x = 4.

Now, we can find out how many cups Juan currently drinks: 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups.

To find out how many cups Juan needs to reduce, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake: 20 - 4 = 16 cups.

"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how many action figures he bought each day and then add them up.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day on wooden action figures. Since he spent $70 in total, we can calculate the number of days he spent on wooden action figures as follows:

$70 / $5 = 14 days

However, he only spent 4 days on wooden action figures (Sunday to Wednesday). So, he spent $5 x 4 = $20 on wooden action figures.

Now, let's calculate how much money he has left:

$70 - $20 = $50

Since he has $50 left, and he will spend $2 each day on plastic action figures for the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), we can calculate the number of plastic action figures he can buy as follows:

$50 / $2 = 25

Since he can buy 25 plastic action figures, and he already bought 4 wooden action figures, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is:

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to first calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is: 
20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is: 
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is: 
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month:

Total cost for bread per 10 sandwiches: $3.00 per loaf * 1 loaf (since 1 loaf makes 10 sandwiches) = $3.00
Total cost for cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches: $30.00
Total cost per 10 sandwiches: $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

Total revenue per 10 sandwiches: $7.00 per sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $70.00

Since they sell 10 sandwiches at a time, we can calculate the profit per 10 sandwiches:
Profit per 10 sandwiches: Total revenue per 10 sandwiches - Total cost per 10 sandwiches = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

To find the profit per sandwich, we can divide the profit per 10 sandwiches by 10:
Profit per sandwich: $37.00 / 10 = $3.70

Total birds seen = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90
Total birds seen = 280

Number of days = 7

Average birds per day = Total birds seen / Number of days
Average birds per day = 280 / 7
Average birds per day = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the given operations step by step.

1. The starting value of the number train is 20.
2. Half of the starting value is 20 / 2 = 10.
3. The starting value plus half the number is 20 + 10 = 30.
4. The resulting value is divided by 5, so 30 / 5 = 6.
5. The resulting value is multiplied by the starting value minus 12, so 6 * (20 - 12) = 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To find the total number of cards they have together, we need to find out how many cards each of them has and then add them together.

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he has, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, let's add the number of cards they have together: 5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18.

The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4%, we need to find the temperature that is 4% less than 520.

First, we need to find 4% of 520, which is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.

Now, we subtract 20.8 from 520 to get the temperature that Maggie should set her oven to: 520 - 20.8 = 499.2.

The final answer is: 499.2"
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time as follows:
1 hour = 60 minutes
Adding 30 minutes to that, we get:
60 + 30 = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the time as follows:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
Adding 5 minutes to that, we get:
120 + 5 = 125 minutes

Now, we add the time of both movies together:
90 + 125 = 215 minutes

The final answer is: 215"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price.

Herb's house price = $76,000
30% of Herb's house price = 0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800
Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
= $76,000 - $22,800
= $53,200

Now, we need to find the combined value of the two houses.
Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
= $76,000 + $53,200
= $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To find the total number of utensils brought by Judy, we first need to determine how many cups and dishes she brought. 

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups Judy brought is 12, and the total number of dishes she brought is 24. The total number of cups her friend brought is 40, and the total number of dishes her friend brought is 44.

To find the total number of utensils brought by Judy, we add the number of cups and dishes she brought: 12 + 24 = 36.

To find the total number of utensils brought by her friend, we add the number of cups and dishes her friend brought: 40 + 44 = 84.

The total number of utensils brought by the two is the sum of the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend: 36 + 84 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we need to first find the total number of pairs of contacts Pete will need for 90 days. Since 90 single use contacts will last him 45 days, he will need 90 / 45 = 2 pairs of contacts per day. 

Since he buys 2 boxes, he will have a total of 2 * 90 = 180 single use contacts. This will last him 180 / 2 = 90 days. 

However, we are looking for the cost per pair of contacts. Since he buys 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 * $100.00 = $200.00. 

Since he has 180 single use contacts, and each pair has 2 contacts, he will have 180 / 2 = 90 pairs of contacts. 

The discount is 10% off, so the discount amount is 10% of $200.00, which is 0.1 * $200.00 = $20.00. 

The final cost will be $200.00 - $20.00 = $180.00. 

The cost per pair of contacts will be $180.00 / 90 pairs = $2.00 per pair. 

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate the total hours worked by each of them and then multiply it by the hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

The hourly wage is $10. Jill's total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30. John's total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many calories Hannah burns in total, we need to calculate the calories burned during aerobics and running. 

Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times 100 ml is needed.

Total calories burned: 1600
Divide by 200: 1600 / 200 = 8

So, Hannah needs to drink 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water. 

The final answer is: 800"
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. 

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans)
2. G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans)
3. B + R + G = 4500 (total number of jelly beans)

Substituting the first two equations into the third equation, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3.00B = 4500
Divide both sides by 3:
B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

To find the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM. 
After the first increase, his speed is 52 WPM. 
To find the third measurement, we add 5 WPM to the second measurement: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM.

Now, we have the three measurements: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM. 

To find the average, we add the three measurements and divide by 3: 
(47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"To find the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then subtract the weight change for the first option from the weight change for the second option.

For the first option (Cheerios), Martin loses 1.25 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he will lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

For the second option (donuts), Martin gains 1.75 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he will gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

1. Alex invites 100 people via email, and each of them invites 2 friends. 
   So, the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

2. Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them say they will bring their spouses. 
   So, the total number of people Alex's friends will bring is 10 + 8 = 18.

3. Now, we add the people invited via email and the people Alex's friends will bring to get the total number of people attending.
   Total people = 300 + 18 = 318.

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats.

"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to find the weight of the Papillon first, then multiply it by 44.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

"To find the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. 

The cost of the boots on eBay is $13. 
The shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

So, the total cost of the boots on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

The total cost of the boots on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to reach or exceed 20 feet. 

Since the beanstalk doubles in height every day and starts at 4 feet, we can calculate its height for each day as follows:

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein content per gram of mushroom by dividing the protein content by the weight of the mushroom: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushroom.

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can multiply the protein content per gram of mushroom by the weight of mushrooms he eats per day: 0.03 grams/gram * 200 grams = 6 grams of protein per day.

To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7: 6 grams/day * 7 days = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let Jerry's current age be 'x'. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can write the equation: 
x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get: 
x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get: 
-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get: 
x = 10

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 
10 + 3 = 13

"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown, and then subtract the deposit he has already paid.

The base price of each implant is $2000, and he needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

He wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the implants and the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

He has already paid a deposit of $600, so the amount he still needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since he makes $15 per hour at work, to find out how many hours he needs to work to pay for the dental work, we divide the amount he still needs to pay by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it can be represented as 2x. 
And since one angle is three times the smallest angle, it can be represented as 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

One angle is twice the smallest angle: 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
One angle is three times the smallest angle: 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

8 quarters = 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
6 dimes = 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

Total amount of money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball
= 345 cents / 5 cents

"To find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to first find out how many pounds Ruiz makes in an hour. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how many pounds he makes in an hour, we divide 120 by 2. 
120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour. 
3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, we know that Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour and Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour. 

In 12 hours, Ruiz will make 60 * 12 = 720 pounds of chocolates.
In 12 hours, Marissa will make 45 * 12 = 540 pounds of chocolates.

Total revenue from the first four hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

For the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
Total cups sold in the next two hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups
Total revenue from the next two hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

"To find out how many times the tires rotate in a month, we need to multiply the number of miles driven per month by the number of rotations per mile. 

Rotations per month = 400 miles/month * 725 rotations/mile = 290,000 rotations/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we need to multiply the rotations per month by 12 to get the total rotations per year.

Rotations per year = 290,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 3,480,000 rotations/year

Now, we need to divide the total number of rotations a tire can undergo by the number of rotations per year to find out how many years the tire will last.

"To find the number of students, we first need to find the total number of seats in the auditorium. 

Total number of seats = Number of rows * Number of seats per row
Total number of seats = 4 * 18
Total number of seats = 72

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. 
Number of seats occupied by administrators = Total number of seats * (1/4)
Number of seats occupied by administrators = 72 * (1/4)
Number of seats occupied by administrators = 18

Remaining seats after administrators = Total number of seats - Number of seats occupied by administrators
Remaining seats after administrators = 72 - 18
Remaining seats after administrators = 54

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. 
Number of seats occupied by parents = Remaining seats after administrators * (1/3)
Number of seats occupied by parents = 54 * (1/3)
Number of seats occupied by parents = 18

Remaining seats after parents = Remaining seats after administrators - Number of seats occupied by parents
Remaining seats after parents = 54 - 18
Remaining seats after parents = 36

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students. 
Number of students = Remaining seats after parents
Number of students = 36

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim chews during school, we need to calculate how many 2-hour periods are in an 8-hour school day. 

8 hours / 2 hours = 4 periods

Since Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours, he chews 4 pieces during school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

In total, Jim chews 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum.

He started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

When his sister asks for gum, he gives her half of the remaining gum. Half of 14 is 14 / 2 = 7.

So, Jim gives his sister 7 pieces of gum. He is left with 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum.

"To find the total number of flowers that have bloomed, we need to first find the total number of flowers in the garden. 

There are 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row, so the total number of flowers is 10 * 20 = 200.

Since only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we need to multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5.

4/5 * 200 = (4 * 200) / 5 = 800 / 5 = 160

So, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s. 

1 Mb = 1000 kb
1 s = 1 second

So, 20 kb/s = 20/1000 Mb/s = 0.02 Mb/s

Now, to find the speed in Mb per hour, we multiply the speed in Mb/s by the number of seconds in an hour (3600 s).

Speed in Mb/h = 0.02 Mb/s * 3600 s/h = 72 Mb/h

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars, then calculate his commission on that profit.

First, let's find the total cost of the cars: 
10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000

The company paid 30% of the cost to acquire the cars, so the amount they paid is:
$250,000 * 0.3 = $75,000

The profit from selling the cars is the selling price minus the cost:
$250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

James got a 10% commission on the profit:
$175,000 * 0.1 = $17,500

So, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of men who can stay upright, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Given that 25% of the riders can stay upright, and there are 100 riders, we can calculate the number of riders who can stay upright as follows:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25

Now, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women, we can calculate:

60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15

Since the remaining riders are men, we can find the number of men by subtracting the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to find the price of the gold and silver jewels first.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

Given that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and add them together.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the time it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to determine the relative speed between them. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since speed cannot be negative, we need to take the absolute value of the relative speed.

Relative speed = | -15 mph | = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to first determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch by subtracting 6 from Naomi's catch.

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught by adding 3 to Darren's catch.

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Total cost of classes = $60
Number of classes = 10

Cost per class = Total cost of classes / Number of classes
Cost per class = $60 / 10
Cost per class = $6

Since Manny's parents will not sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding this limit.

Let's assume Manny misses x classes. Then, the number of classes he attends is 10 - x.

Cost per class = Total cost of classes / (Number of classes - x)
$10 = $60 / (10 - x)

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (10 - x):
$10(10 - x) = $60

Expanding the equation:
$100 - $10x = $60

Subtracting $100 from both sides:
-$10x = -$40

Dividing both sides by -10:
x = 4

So, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total weekly production, we first need to determine how many customers each person processes in a week. 

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jewel's weekly production is 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day. Julie's weekly production is 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for the two is 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

"To find the cost of 5 apples, we need to first find the cost of one apple. 

Cost of 4 apples = $5.20
Cost of 1 apple = $5.20 / 4 = $1.30

Now, we can find the cost of 5 apples.
Cost of 5 apples = $1.30 * 5 = $6.50

To find the cost of 5 oranges, we need to first find the cost of one orange.

Cost of 3 oranges = $3.30
Cost of 1 orange = $3.30 / 3 = $1.10

Now, we can find the cost of 5 oranges.
Cost of 5 oranges = $1.10 * 5 = $5.50

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges.
Total cost = Cost of 5 apples + Cost of 5 oranges
Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50
Total cost = $12.00

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Fishio received 2000 likes initially.
2. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. 
   So, the number of likes after 3 weeks = 70 * 2000 = 140000.
3. The total number of likes after 3 weeks is the sum of the initial likes and the new likes received in 3 weeks.
   However, we are not given the number of likes received in 3 weeks, so we need to find it first.
   The number of likes after 1 week is 2000, and the number of likes after 3 weeks is 140000. 
   So, the number of likes received in 2 weeks = 140000 - 2000 = 138000.
   The number of likes received in 1 week = 2000.
   The number of likes received in 3 weeks = 138000 + 2000 = 139000.

1. In the first month, Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Let's call the total sales from green hats in the first month ""x"". Then, we can write the equation:

400 = x/2

To find x, we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 400 * 2
x = 800

So, the total sales from green hats in the first month were $800.

2. The total sales in the first month were the sum of sales from red and green hats:

Total sales in the first month = 400 + 800 = $1200

3. In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. Let's calculate the sales in the second month:

Sales in the second month = (3/4) * 1200
Sales in the second month = 900

- Cost of almonds: 1/2 pound * $10/pound = $5
- Cost of walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
- Total cost of the first mixture: $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- Cost of almonds: 1/5 pound * $10/pound = $2
- Cost of walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
- Total cost of the second mixture: $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
Difference = Cost of the first mixture - Cost of the second mixture
Difference = $10 - $7
Difference = $3

The final answer is: $3"
"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can set up the following equation for the total number of legs: 
4S + 2G = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, so we can set up the following equation: 
S + G = 20

We can solve the second equation for G: 
G = 20 - S

Now, substitute G in the first equation: 
4S + 2(20 - S) = 70

Expand the equation: 
4S + 40 - 2S = 70

Combine like terms: 
2S + 40 = 70

Subtract 40 from both sides: 
2S = 30

Divide both sides by 2: 
S = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut. 

First, let's find the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 x $5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he needs 7 pounds for a week (7 days). 

The cost of the more expensive coffee is 7 pounds x $6 per pound = $42.
The cost of the donut is $2.

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

The final answer is: $44"

"To find out how much money each person has, we need to first determine the amount of money Kassidy and Rayna have.

Aurelia has $120. 
Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so Kassidy has (3/4) * 120 = 90 dollars.
Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, we need to add up the total amount of money they have and divide it by 3 to find out how much each person would have if they shared it equally. 
Total money = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.
Each person would have 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.

"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:

Janey's books = 2x + 3

We are given that Janey has 21 books. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To find the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. 

1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so 20 feet is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 inches.

Now, we need to find the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches). 

600 - 240 = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days it will take to reach 600 inches.

360 / 30 = 12

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs 8 more toys.
   Total toys needed so far: 4 (initial toys) + 8 (additional toys) = 12 toys
3. When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs.
   Total dogs now: 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (initial additional dogs) + 16 (new dogs) = 28 dogs
   Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 28 more toys.
   Total toys needed so far: 12 (previous toys) + 28 (new toys) = 40 toys
4. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys.

"To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can calculate the ratio as follows:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 1 potato / 6 hash browns

Now, we can use this ratio to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes:

96 potatoes / 6 hash browns per potato = 96 / 6
96 / 6 = 16

So, 96 potatoes can make 16 times the number of hash browns that 6 potatoes can make. 

Since 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can multiply 36 by 16 to find the total number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes:

36 hash browns * 16 = 576 hash browns

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, but we don't know the total bill yet. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check is $40 + $60 = $100.

"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. 

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = Speed of the turtle x 40 seconds
Distance = 3 x 40
Distance = 120 feet

"To find out how many hours they have to fundraise, we need to first find out how much they need to raise per hour. 

The total amount they need to raise is $6300, and they have already raised $2100 in 3 hours. 

The amount they need to raise per hour is: 
$6300 - $2100 = $4200
$4200 / 3 hours = $1400 per hour

Now, to find out how many hours they need to fundraise in total, we divide the total amount they need to raise by the amount they raise per hour:
$6300 / $1400 = 4.5 hours

They have already raised for 3 hours, so we need to add the remaining hours to the hours they have already raised:
4.5 hours + 3 hours = 7.5 hours

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of water used by the city and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. 

80% of the water used by the city is used for industrial purposes, so the percentage of water used for industrial purposes is 40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%.

To find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city: 40% - 32% = 8%.

"To find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each type of ice cream and then add them together.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. 
So, the production rate of chocolate ice cream is 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. 
So, the production rate of vanilla ice cream is 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

In 48 hours, the total production of chocolate ice cream would be 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts.
In 48 hours, the total production of vanilla ice cream would be 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts.

The total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours would be 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00. Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy.

$6.00 / $1.50 = 4

However, Erin can get 1 free scoop for every 2 scoops she buys. So, for every 3 scoops, she pays for 2 and gets 1 free. 

Since Erin has $6.00, she can buy 4 scoops (paying for 2 and getting 2 free) or 2 sets of 3 scoops (paying for 4 scoops and getting 2 free). 

2 sets of 3 scoops will give her a total of 6 scoops (2 sets of 3 scoops).

"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of candies they eat in two weeks and subtract that from their initial amount.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days (two weeks), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Ginger's remaining candy: 100 - 56 = 44 pieces
Amy's remaining candy: 100 - 42 = 58 pieces

The difference in the amount of candy Amy and Ginger have is 58 - 44 = 14 pieces.

"To find the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends, we first need to find out how many slices they ate in total. Since there are 5 people in total (Bryce and 4 friends), and 2/3 of their pizzas were eaten, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by these 5 people as follows:

5 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 5 * 8 = 40 slices

However, this is the total number of slices eaten by 5 people, but we know that 2 of these people ate 2/3 of their pizzas, and 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas. So, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten by 3 people who ate 2/3 of their pizzas:

3 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 3 * 8 = 24 slices

Now, we subtract the number of slices eaten by 3 people from the total number of slices eaten by 5 people to find the number of slices eaten by the remaining 2 people:

40 slices - 24 slices = 16 slices

Now, we know that 2 friends ate ¾ of their pizzas, which is 9 slices each (3/4 * 12 = 9). So, the total number of slices eaten by these 2 friends is:

2 friends * 9 slices/friend = 18 slices

Now, we subtract the total number of slices eaten by all 7 people from the total number of slices in 7 pizzas:

7 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 84 slices

Now, we subtract the total number of slices eaten by all 7 people from the total number of slices in 7 pizzas:

84 slices - 40 slices = 44 slices

Now, we subtract the number of slices eaten by 2 friends who ate 2/3 of their pizzas from the remaining slices:

44 slices - 16 slices = 28 slices

Now, we subtract the number of slices eaten by 2 friends who ate ¾ of their pizzas from the remaining slices:

28 slices - 18 slices = 10 slices

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so 8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding 4 inches to that gives us 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches, and it is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes 'x'. 

We can write the equation as: 100 = 9x + 10

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us: 90 = 9x

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us: x = 10

"To find out how many marbles Carl has, we need to multiply Sean's marbles by 4 since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. 

Sean has 56 marbles, so Carl has 56 * 4 = 224 marbles.

To find out how many marbles Cal has, we need to multiply Sean's marbles by 2 since Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean. 

Sean has 56 marbles, so Cal has 56 * 2 = 112 marbles.

Now, we need to add the marbles of Carl and Cal to find the combined total. 

Carl has 224 marbles and Cal has 112 marbles, so the combined total is 224 + 112 = 336.

The final answer is: 336"
"To find out how many groups are needed, we first need to divide the total number of students by the number of students per group.

The total number of glasses Jeff has now is 86, and the total number of plates Jeff has now is 42."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. 

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading her small stickers.

Now, she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading her large stickers.

Now, she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. 
Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading her large stickers.

Now, let's add up all the buttons she has: 
- 27 small buttons from trading small stickers
- 20 large buttons from trading large stickers
- 60 small buttons from trading large stickers

Since large buttons are worth three small buttons, we can convert the large buttons to small buttons: 
20 large buttons * 3 = 60 small buttons

Now, let's add up all the small buttons: 
- 27 small buttons from trading small stickers
- 60 small buttons from trading large stickers
- 60 small buttons from converting large buttons

Total small buttons = 27 + 60 + 60 = 147 small buttons

Total buttons = 147 small buttons

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let x be the number of votes against the new regulation. 
Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x. 
The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against, which is 33. 
So, we can write the equation: x + 2x = 33. 
Combine like terms: 3x = 33. 
Divide both sides by 3: x = 11. 
Since x is the number of votes against the new regulation, the number of votes in favor is 2x, which is 2 * 11 = 22.

"To find the total number of puppies Jana has, we first need to find the total number of Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total Puppies = 27

"Let's break down the information given:

- The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250.
- The first house needs 1/2 of what the second house needs.
- The third house needs double what the first house needs.

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as x. Then, the first house needs x/2 cases, and the third house needs 2*(x/2) = x cases.

Since the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250, we can set up the equation:

x + (x/2) + x = 250

To simplify the equation, multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms:

5x = 500

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

Now that we know the second house needs 100 cases, we can find the number of cases the third house needs, which is x = 100 cases.

Initial amount of money = $80
Cost of the ball = $20

Remaining money = Initial amount of money - Cost of the ball
Remaining money = $80 - $20
Remaining money = $60

Since each candy bar costs $5, we can find out how many candy bars Marissa bought by dividing the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar.

Number of candy bars = Remaining money / Cost of each candy bar
Number of candy bars = $60 / $5
Number of candy bars = 12

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he already makes $60 from eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

He has 25 ears of corn, so to find out how much he should sell each ear for, we divide the total amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25). 

$75 / 25 = $3.

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to calculate the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so we multiply 600 by 1/3:
600 * (1/3) = 200 movies in series

Since Mike can buy the series for $6, the cost of the series is $6.

Next, let's find the number of remaining movies. We subtract the movies in series from the total number of movies:
600 - 200 = 400 remaining movies

40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we multiply 400 by 0.4:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

The cost of the older movies is $5 each, so the total cost of the older movies is:
160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are not in series and are not older movies, so they are normal movies. There are 400 - 160 = 240 normal movies.

The cost of the normal movies is $10 each, so the total cost of the normal movies is:
240 * $10 = $2400

The total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection is the sum of the cost of the series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies:
$6 + $800 + $2400 = $3206

"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the scores of Ava and Emma separately and then find the difference.

Let's assume Emma's score is x. 

Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's enemy score is x + 8. 
Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, Ava's berry score is x + 3.
Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, Ava's timer score is (60 - (x + 4)) because the total time for the level is 60 seconds.

Emma's score is x + (number of enemies Emma jumps on) + (number of berries Emma collects) + (time left on the timer for Emma).
Emma's score is x + 0 + 0 + (60 - x) = 60.

Ava's score is (x + 8) + (x + 3) + (60 - (x + 4)) = 2x + 7 + 56 - x = x + 63.

The difference in their scores is (x + 63) - 60 = x + 3.

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to find the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. 

Two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, so the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 x 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the cost of the other two pizzas. 

Total cost of all four pizzas = 64 dollars
Cost of two known pizzas = 60 dollars
Cost of the other two pizzas = Total cost of all four pizzas - Cost of two known pizzas
Cost of the other two pizzas = 64 - 60
Cost of the other two pizzas = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the cost by 2 to find the cost of one pizza.

Cost of one pizza = Cost of the other two pizzas / 2
Cost of one pizza = 4 / 2
Cost of one pizza = 2 dollars

"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

The total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is the sum of the times they ride on usual days and the times they ride on the extra days, which is 15 + 12 = 27.

"Let's break down the information given:

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.

After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. The number of orange fish he bought would then be 2x (since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish).

The total number of fish in the pet store tank was 17. Since the fish in the pet store tank were a mix of white and orange, we can set up an equation based on the fact that the total number of fish he bought is 17:

3 (initial orange fish) + x (white fish bought) + 2x (orange fish bought) = 17

Combine like terms:

3 + 3x = 17

Subtract 3 from both sides:

3x = 14

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 14/3

x = 4.67

Since you can't buy a fraction of a fish, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, as you can't buy a fraction of a fish. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of white fish he bought, and the question does not specify that we must round down. 

However, since the question asks for the number of white fish he bought, and we know that the number of white fish he bought must be a whole number, we can infer that the question is asking for the number of white fish he bought, which is a whole number. 

The number of white fish he bought is 4.67, which is not a whole number. However, we can infer that the question is asking for the number of white fish he bought, which is a whole number."

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED TVs, we subtract the total number of smart and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first determine how much the school will cover. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, and the trip costs $300, the school will cover $300 / 2 = $150.

John has $50, so to find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the amount the school will not cover. The school is covering $150, so they will not cover $300 - $150 = $150. Since John has $50, he is missing $150 - $50 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature at night. Since it's 33 degrees colder during the night, we subtract 33 from the day's temperature:

45 (day) - 33 (night) = 12 degrees

Now, we need to find out how many degrees the temperature needs to rise to prevent the pipes from freezing. Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, and the temperature at night is 12 degrees, we subtract 12 from 32:

32 (freezing point) - 12 (night temperature) = 20 degrees

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we divide the total degrees needed to prevent freezing by the degrees each log heats up:

20 (degrees needed) / 5 (degrees per log) = 4

Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"To find the total number of seashells, we first need to find the number of groups and then the number of groups that brought back seashells. 

First, we find the number of groups: 
Number of people = 90
Number of people per group = 9
Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Next, we find the number of groups that brought back seashells:
Fraction of groups that brought back seashells = 3/5
Number of groups that brought back seashells = Number of groups * Fraction of groups that brought back seashells
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 6

Now, we find the total number of seashells:
Number of seashells per group = 2
Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total number of seashells = 6 * 2
Total number of seashells = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the number of people on the train after the two stops, we need to subtract the number of people who got off and add the number of people who got on.

Initially, there were 172 people on the train.

At the first stop, 47 people got off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
172 - 47 = 125

Then, 13 people got on, so we add 13 to 125:
125 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people got off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
138 - 38 = 100

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

The final answer is: 100"

"To find the total number of lions, we need to add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs. 

First, we know there are 12 female lions. 
Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can find the number of male lions by dividing the number of female lions by 2: 12 / 2 = 6 male lions.
We also know there are 14 lion cubs.

Now, we can add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions: 12 + 6 + 14 = 32.

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price. 

First, let's find the discount amount: 
Discount = 25% of $40
Discount = 0.25 * $40
Discount = $10

Now, let's find the price after the discount:
Price after discount = Original price - Discount
Price after discount = $40 - $10
Price after discount = $30

Now, let's find out how much money Mike will have left over:
Money left over = $50 - $30
Money left over = $20

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total salary for each month, then multiply it by 3.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After 3 months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (hired in the first month) + 20 (hired in the second month) + 20 (hired in the third month) = 260 employees

The total salary for each month is the number of employees multiplied by the salary per employee:
200 employees * $4000 = $800,000 per month

Since the company pays this amount every month for 3 months, the total amount paid is:
$800,000 * 3 = $2,400,000

The final answer is: $2,400,000"
"To find the total time the choir will be caroling, we need to add the time it takes to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and the time it takes to sing ""Jingle Bells"" once.

Time for ""Deck the Halls"" = 150 seconds
Time for ""Jingle Bells"" = 240 seconds

Total time for ""Deck the Halls"" = 2 * 150 seconds = 300 seconds
Total time for ""Jingle Bells"" = 240 seconds

Total caroling time = Total time for ""Deck the Halls"" + Total time for ""Jingle Bells""
Total caroling time = 300 seconds + 240 seconds
Total caroling time = 540 seconds

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial pay rate is $10 per hour. After 2 months, he gets a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new pay rate $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After another year, he gets a raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final pay rate $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, so her starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours:

Billy's total earnings = (10 * 2) + (10.50 * 18) + (11.50 * 0) = 20 + 189 + 0 = 209
Sally's total earnings = (10.50 * 2) + (11.50 * 18) = 21 + 207 = 228

The difference in their earnings is 228 - 209 = 19.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"

"To find Nikita's score, we need to calculate half of Pierson's score and add 11. 

Pierson's score is 278. Half of 278 is 278 / 2 = 139. 
Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, so Nikita's score is 139 + 11 = 150.

To find the total score, we add Pierson's score and Nikita's score: 278 + 150 = 428.

The final answer is: 428"
"To find the total number of trees planted by the students, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of students per class and then multiply the result by 1 (since each student plants 1 tree).

Total students = 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students
Total trees planted by students = 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

To find the total number of trees planted by the teachers, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of teachers per class and then multiply the result by 2 (since each teacher plants 2 trees).

Total teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers
Total trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Total trees planted = Total trees planted by students + Total trees planted by teachers
Total trees planted = 1000 + 240
Total trees planted = 1240

"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since Bubbles can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we will keep the answer as a decimal because the question asks for the number of stuffed goats she should buy, not the number of stuffed goats she should buy rounded up. 

The number of stuffed goats she should buy is 4.2."
"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in 2 weeks and 1 week.

In 2 weeks, there are 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in 2 weeks.

In 1 week, there are 7 days. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in 1 week.

Total hours Kris has played = 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours she has played from the target hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between the two distances.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 70 miles/hour x 2 hours = 140 miles

The difference in distance between the two cars is:
Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car."
"To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the diamond and the gold, then add the 30% premium.

Cost of diamond: $600
Cost of gold: $300
Total cost of diamond and gold: $600 + $300 = $900

The premium is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold, which is 0.3 x $900 = $270.

Total cost with premium: $900 + $270 = $1170

The final answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340, and the total number of third-graders is 500. 

The number of fourth-graders who passed is 40, and the total number of fourth-graders is 100.

The number of fifth-graders who passed is twice the number of fourth-graders who passed, which is 2 * 40 = 80. The total number of fifth-graders is 400.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school:
Total students who passed = 340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460
Total students in the school = 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students in the school, multiplied by 100 to convert it to a percentage:
Overall pass rate = (460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to determine how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and he has 2 bags of glass chips, we need to find out how many chips he has in total. 

Each bag holds 72 chips, so 2 bags will hold 2 x 72 = 144 chips.

Now, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of chips needed to make one square inch of the mosaic. 

144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches.

Since the mosaic is three inches tall, and it's a 2D shape, we need to find the area of the mosaic, which is already calculated as 12 square inches. 

To find the length of the mosaic, we need to find the square root of the area, since the area of a rectangle is length times width. 

However, since the height is given, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle (Area = length * width) and rearrange it to find the length (Length = Area / width). 

Area = 12 square inches, width = 3 inches. 

Length = 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount of tea each group of students drank and add them together.

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so the total amount of tea they drank is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so the total amount of tea they drank is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.
The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party in gallons is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to first determine how many candies he has in total. 

Dale initially ordered 100 candies and then sold 150. So, he had 100 - 150 = -50 candies left. However, this is not possible since you can't have a negative number of candies. This means he must have ordered more candies to sell. 

Dale then ordered 100 more candies. So, he now has 100 (initial candies) + 100 (additional candies) = 200 candies in total.

Since he has 200 candies and he wants to sell all of them, and he has already sold 150, he needs to sell 200 - 150 = 50 more candies.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the number of students on campus at the end of May, we need to calculate the number of times the initial number of students doubles in a year. 

Since the number of students doubles every month, it will double 12 times in a year (from January to December). 

The initial number of students is 10. 

Doubling 10 for 12 times:
- January: 10 * 2 = 20
- February: 20 * 2 = 40
- March: 40 * 2 = 80
- April: 80 * 2 = 160
- May: 160 * 2 = 320

The number of students on campus at the beginning of the year is 10. The number of students on campus at the end of May is 320. 

To find the number of additional students who joined, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:
320 - 10 = 310

"To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25).

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (5 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 x 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 x 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used and the ones dropped from the total number of marshmallows in the bag.

Total marshmallows in the bag = 35
Marshmallows used by John = 9
Marshmallows used by DeSean = 9
Total marshmallows used = 9 + 9 = 18
Marshmallows dropped = 3
Total marshmallows used and dropped = 18 + 3 = 21
Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14

Since there are 14 marshmallows left, and there are 2 kids, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many each kid can have.

Marshmallows left per kid = 14 / 2 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the total time played by each person and then multiply it by the cost per minute. 

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. 
Two of his friends can play for half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. 
One of his friends can play for 1.5 times as long, so they can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter.

The total time played is 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Jack's time: 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters
Two friends' time: 240 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters * 2 = 48 quarters
Better friend's time: 240 minutes / 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters

Total quarters used = 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 * 0.25 = $17.

The final answer is: $17"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces.
- The amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance.
- The amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar.
- The amount of oil is twice as much as the amount of salt.
- The amount of salt is twice as much as the amount of zest.

Let's denote the amount of zest (and fragrance) as x. 
Since the amount of salt is twice as much as the amount of zest, the amount of salt is 2x.
Since the amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, the amount of sugar is also 2x.
Since the amount of oil is twice as much as the amount of salt, the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total amount of the scrub is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: x (zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces.

Combine like terms: 8x = 10.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 10 / 8 = 1.25.

Since the amount of oil is 4x, the amount of oil is 4 * 1.25 = 5 ounces.

Cupcakes already have: 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Now, subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs:
63 - 48 = 15

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

3. He gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

4. Now, let's calculate the total number of cars Joe gave away or sold. He sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars, so in total, he gave away 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

5. To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the total number of cars he gave away from the initial number of cars he had. Joe had 40 cars initially and gave away 24 cars, so he has 40 - 24 = 16 cars left.

"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine how much money the students raised in total. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the amount raised by the students is:

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Now, we know that 20 students raised a total of $125,000. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount by the number of students:

$125,000 / 20 = $6,250

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 
On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

Now, we add the time from both days:
Total time = 480 + 240 = 720 minutes

"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first find the total number of cars in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break.

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When he got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 of the cars had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 had left, so 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars had left.

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35.

However, the question asks for the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break. This would be the number of cars that were present when he got out of class for the lunch break, which is 35.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, Smendrick has 3x cards, and Becca has 3x + 12 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs.

She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had (1/3) * 9 = 3 yellow eggs.

To find the total number of eggs, we add the number of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

- Cost per pound: $0.35
- Weight of the book: 4 pounds
- Cost per mile: $0.08
- Distance: 20 miles
- Total cost of shipping: (0.35 * 4) + (0.08 * 20) = 1.4 + 1.6 = $2.99

The refund amount is 75% of the purchase price:
- Purchase price: $32
- Refund amount: 0.75 * 32 = $24

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:
- Total cost of shipping: $2.99
- Refund amount: $24
- Total loss: 2.99 + (32 - 24) = 2.99 + 8 = $10.99

The final answer is: $10.99"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spent and subtract it from the total amount of money she had initially.

Initially, Mulan had $40. Her father gave her $100, so she now has $40 + $100 = $140.

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of jeans is 2 x $30 = $60.

She also buys a bag for $20.

The total amount of money she spent is $60 (jeans) + $20 (bag) = $80.

Now, we subtract the total amount of money she spent from the total amount of money she had initially: $140 - $80 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars.
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends per week and multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time she spends on TikTok per week:

- 18 videos * 4 minutes per video = 72 minutes for recording videos
- 2 hours = 120 minutes for writing songs
- 15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes for makeup

Total time per week = 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the total time per week by 4:

282 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1128 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

1128 minutes / 60 = 18.8 hours

The final answer is: 18.8"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of the initial installation is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures, we need to calculate the cost of the additional items.

Additional mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors, cost: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
Additional chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier, cost: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
Additional pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 pictures, cost: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

Total cost of additional items: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

Total cost: $129.00 (initial installation) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00

The final answer is: $324.00"
"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first determine how much money Anthony has. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $20.00 + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $30.00

Now that we know Anthony's savings, we can calculate Roy's savings. Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we can calculate Roy's savings as follows:

Let's first find 40% of Anthony's savings:
40% of $30.00 = 0.4 x $30.00 = $12.00

Now, we add this amount to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings:
Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% of Anthony's savings
Roy's savings = $30.00 + $12.00
Roy's savings = $42.00

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to determine the lifting capacity of each person relative to Pompei. 

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches. 
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches. 
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 
480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total distance traveled by Mason, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours, and then add them together.

Distance = Speed x Time

For the first 4 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles

For the next 6 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, one kangaroo would take 18 hours multiplied by 3, which equals 54 hours.

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, if one kangaroo takes 54 hours to travel across the highway, four turtles traveling at half the speed would take 54 hours multiplied by 2, which equals 108 hours.

The final answer is: 108"
"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we need to find out how many dishes each of them made and add them together.

Kora made 20 dishes.

Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, let's add the number of dishes made by each of them: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution.

First, let's calculate the price of the new laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika has received $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom, so the total amount of money she has received is:
$150 + $80 = $230

Since she only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, the total amount of money she has is the price of the laptop after trading in her old one plus the extra $50 she needs:
$400 + $50 = $450

Now, to find out how much money Erika had in her purse initially, we subtract the amount she received from the total amount she has:
$450 - $230 = $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of apple slices, we need to calculate the number of slices from the large apples and the small apples separately and then add them together.

3 large apples can be sliced into 3 x 5 = 15 slices.
5 small apples can be sliced into 5 x 3 = 15 slices.

Total number of slices = 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
30 (total slices) - 15 (slices eaten) = 15 slices.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to find out how many liters of milk one cow produces per day. 

Since the farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow, and he has 3 cows, the total milk produced per day is 5 * 3 = 15 liters.

Now, to find out how many cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we divide 25 by 5 (the amount of milk one cow produces per day). 

25 / 5 = 5

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we subtract 3 from the total number of cows needed to find out how many more cows he needs.

5 - 3 = 2

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each stick and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which is 1/6 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 1/6: 
12 * (1/6) = 12/6 = 2 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which is 2/3 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 2/3: 
12 * (2/3) = 24/3 = 8 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which is 1/2 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 1/2: 
12 * (1/2) = 12/2 = 6 millimeters.

Now, we add the unused portions of the glue sticks together: 
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters."

"Let's denote your age as 'x'. Since you are three years younger than your brother, your brother's age is 'x + 3'. Your sister is 2 years younger than you, so her age is 'x - 2'. 

Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, which is 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of all your ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 10 + 3x - 1 = 87.

Combine the 'x' terms and the constants: 8x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 8x = 78.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 9.75.

Since age cannot be a fraction, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can infer that the problem is asking for a whole number age, but the solution is not a whole number. This could be due to the problem's constraints or the way it's phrased. 

However, if we consider the context of the problem and the fact that ages are usually whole numbers, we can try to find the closest whole number that satisfies the equation. 

Let's try x = 9: 9 + (9 + 3) + (9 - 2) + 3(9 + 3) - 1 = 9 + 12 + 7 + 3(12) - 1 = 9 + 12 + 7 + 36 - 1 = 63. This is less than 87.

Let's try x = 10: 10 + (10 + 3) + (10 - 2) + 3(10 + 3) - 1 = 10 + 13 + 8 + 3(13) - 1 = 10 + 13 + 8 + 39 - 1 = 69. This is still less than 87.

Let's try x = 11: 11 + (11 + 3) + (11 - 2) + 3(11 + 3) - 1 = 11 + 14 + 9 + 3(14) - 1 = 11 + 14 + 9 + 42 - 1 = 75. This is still less than 87.

Let's try x = 12: 12 + (12 + 3) + (12 - 2) + 3(12 + 3) - 1 = 12 + 15 + 10 + 3(15) - 1 = 12 + 15 + 10 + 45 - 1 = 81. This is still less than 87.

Let's try x = 13: 13 + (13 + 3) + (13 - 2) + 3(13 + 3) - 1 = 13 + 16 + 11 + 3(16) - 1 = 13 + 16 + 11 + 48 - 1 = 87. This satisfies the equation.

"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to determine the number of silver coins first. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and Gretchen has 70 gold coins, we can set up an equation to find the number of silver coins:

Let x be the number of silver coins.
Then, x + 30 = 70 (since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins)

To solve for x, we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:
x = 70 - 30
x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

Now, to find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins:
Total coins = 70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins)
Total coins = 110

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to get S = (F - 12) + 25
S = F + 13

We also know that S + A + F = 85 (Together, they have 85 books)

Substituting the first two equations into the third one, we get (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85
Combine like terms: 2F + 1 = 85
Subtract 1 from both sides: 2F = 84
Divide both sides by 2: F = 42

The final answer is: 42"
"To find the weight of the carrots, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the weight of the carrots is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The weight of the carrots is 7 pounds."
"To find out how many boxes of Jello Greg needs, we need to calculate the total number of Jello cups he needs. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 Jello cups, the total number of Jello cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120.

Since one box of Jello makes 10 Jello cups, the total number of boxes needed is 120 / 10 = 12.

The cost of one box of Jello is $1.25, so the total cost will be 12 * $1.25 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total cost of the phones, we multiply the number of phones by the cost per phone: 
5 phones * $700/phone = $3500

The seller gives the electronics seller $4000 in dollar bills. To find the change, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given: 
$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to find out how much Keenan spends per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays 40% of the cost. 

40% of $400 is 0.4 x $400 = $160. 

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can divide the amount Keenan spends per month by 4 to find out how much he spends per week. 

$160 / 4 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them up.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. First, we need to find out how many pieces were left after the first two days. 
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces left.

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26.
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up the total number of pieces he ate on each day.
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda, we need to divide the total cost of 7 bottles of soda by 7 and then multiply by 3. 

Cost of 1 bottle of soda = $21.00 / 7 = $3.00
Cost of 3 bottles of soda = $3.00 * 3 = $9.00

To find the cost of 2 bottles of water, we need to divide the total cost of 4 bottles of water by 4 and then multiply by 2.

Cost of 1 bottle of water = $8.00 / 4 = $2.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = $2.00 * 2 = $4.00

Now, we add the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water to find the total cost.

Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

The final answer is: $13.00"

"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to determine her hourly rate. 

Her hourly rate can be calculated by dividing the amount she earned ($33) by the number of hours she worked (3). 

Hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours = $11 per hour.

Now, we can multiply her hourly rate by the total number of hours she will work (12) to find out her total earnings.

Total earnings = $11 per hour * 12 hours = $132.

The final answer is: $132"
"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the sequence of events:

1. Paul starts with 52 marbles.
2. He receives 28 marbles from his friend, so now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.
3. He loses 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 80 by 4. 80 / 4 = 20. So, he loses 20 marbles.
4. Now, we subtract the marbles he lost from the total he had after receiving the marbles from his friend: 80 - 20 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she gets from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
Amy correctly answers 80% of 10 questions, so she answers 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correctly.
Each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, so she gets 8 * 1 = 8 points from multiple-choice questions.

For true/false questions: 
Amy correctly answers 90% of 20 questions, so she answers 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correctly.
Each true/false question is worth 1 point, so she gets 18 * 1 = 18 points from true/false questions.

For long-answer questions: 
Amy correctly answers 60% of 5 questions, so she answers 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correctly.
Each long-answer question is worth 5 points, so she gets 3 * 5 = 15 points from long-answer questions.

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens, we can calculate this as:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Next, we know that he needs to make a profit of $2000 by selling these chickens at $50 each. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of chickens by the selling price:

180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000

Since he wants to make a profit of $2000, we can set up the equation:

Total Revenue - Total Cost = Profit
$9000 - Total Cost = $2000

To find the total cost, we can rearrange the equation:

Total Cost = $9000 - $2000
Total Cost = $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000."
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 2, since they sold an equal number of glasses. 

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people selling glasses = 2 (Micah and Mitchell)
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / Number of people selling glasses
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = 32 / 2
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = 16

Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah. To do this, we subtract the number of glasses sold by Micah from the number of glasses sold by Julie.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 16
Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah
Difference = 14 - 16
Difference = -2

"To find out how much Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure first.

Let's start with the cost of the manicure. Since Iris spent 1/4 as much on the manicure as she did on her hair, and she spent $400 on her hair, the cost of the manicure is:

$400 * 1/4 = $100

Now, let's find the cost of the pedicure. Since Iris spent 3/4 as much on the pedicure as she did on the manicure, and the manicure cost $100, the cost of the pedicure is:

$100 * 3/4 = $75

Now, let's add up the costs of the hair, manicure, and pedicure to find the total amount Iris spent at the spa:

$400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575

The final answer is: $575"

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years. This means her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years old.

Let's assume Melanie's age in x years will be thrice her present age. So, her age in x years will be 3 * 8 = 24 years old.

Since her current age is 8, the number of years it will take for her age to be 24 is 24 - 8 = 16 years.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

The cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10.
The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 * 2 * $10 = $120, since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.
The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 * $2 = $14, since each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.

The total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart is $10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $156 = -$91.

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means that Kelly has overspent her budget by $91."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts.
2. The final concert has a 15-minute encore.
3. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

Let's denote the runtime of her usual concerts as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, its runtime is 2x. 

The total runtime of the final concert is the sum of the runtime of the concert itself and the encore, which is 2x + 15 = 65.

Now, we can solve for x:
2x + 15 = 65
Subtract 15 from both sides:
2x = 50
Divide both sides by 2:
x = 25

The runtime of her usual concerts is 25 minutes."

"To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs. 

Let's assume the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is x. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 2x.

However, we know that 20% of the total 50 microphones won't find any space to fit in. This means that 80% of the microphones will be arranged in pairs. 

We can set up the equation: 80% of 50 = 2x

To find 80% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.8: 
50 * 0.8 = 40

Now we have the equation: 40 = 2x

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
x = 40 / 2
x = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.

Then, 2/3rd of 6 birds are flying overhead. To find 2/3rd of 6, we multiply 6 by 2 and divide by 3:
(6 * 2) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4

So, 4 birds are flying overhead.

Next, Jerry sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we multiply the number of groups by the number of birds in each group:
3 * 8 = 24

Now, we add the number of birds in each group together:
6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which is five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns and then subtract that from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is the sum of the lawns she mowed in the first and second week, which is 3x + 5x = 8x.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and she mowed his lawn x times, the total amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn is 6x.

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is the sum of the amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn and the amount she made from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns, which is 6x + 3x + 5x = 14x.

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. So, we can set up the equation:

6x + 14x = 80

Combine like terms:
20x = 80

Divide both sides by 20:
x = 4

Now that we know x, we can find the total amount she made from mowing lawns:
14x = 14 * 4 = 56

Now, we can find the amount she made from lemonade sales by subtracting the amount she made from mowing lawns from her total earnings:
80 - 56 = 24

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today.

So, Denise's total pages read is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel's total pages read is 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is 28 - 13 = 15.

Since Calvin, his wife, and their two children are eating dinner, that's a total of 3 adults and 2 children, which equals 5 people. 

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, we can assume that the pot can fill 5 child bowls (since 5 is the average of 4 and 8). 

So, after dinner, there will be 5 child-sized bowls of soup left.

Each child will eat one bowl for lunch, so the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch is 5."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. 
2. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write the equation: (Duncan's age eight years ago) = 2 * (Adam's age four years ago)
   We know Duncan's current age is 60, so his age eight years ago was 60 - 8 = 52.
   Therefore, the equation becomes: 52 = 2x
3. To find Adam's age four years ago, we need to solve for 'x'. Divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 52 / 2
   x = 26
4. Since we found Adam's age four years ago, we need to add 4 to find his current age: Adam's current age = 26 + 4 = 30

Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

In an 8-hour workday, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, his total earnings for the day would be 320 * $0.20 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku and then divide it by the time it takes to drink one bottle of water.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so an extreme sudoku takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to convert the time from minutes to half hours. 180 minutes is equal to 180 / 30 = 6 half hours.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, he drinks 6 bottles of water in 6 half hours.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the red balloons. Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there were 20 red balloons, the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Since Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at the bundle of balloons, and 40 of those were thrown at the red balloons, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons is 18 / 3 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days. 

Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so the total miles driven is 100 * 30 = 3000 miles.

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we need to divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs.

3000 miles / 1000 miles per tune-up = 3 tune-ups.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total hours Bruce works, we need to calculate the hours he works each day and add them up.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2.

The cost of the cake is $11.
The cost of 1 dozen balloons is $0.5 for 2 balloons. Since 1 dozen is 12, the number of 2-balloon sets is 12 / 2 = 6. So, the cost of 1 dozen balloons is 6 * $0.5 = $3.
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total cost is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy these items, the total amount of money they had is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total amount by 2:

$28 / 2 = $14

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14."
"To find out how many pieces of fruit Kira bought in total, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges. 

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit, we need to subtract 2 from the total number of fruits Kira bought.

14 - 2 = 12

So, there are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer, and then add them together.

There are 6 students playing tennis. Since there are twice that number playing volleyball, there are 6 * 2 = 12 students playing volleyball.

The total number of students playing soccer is 16 boys + 22 girls = 38 students.

Now, we add the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer: 6 + 12 + 38 = 56.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

Total revenue = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student * Price per lollipop
Total revenue = 30 * 10 * $0.8
Total revenue = 300 * $0.8
Total revenue = $240

Total cost = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student * Cost per lollipop
Total cost = 30 * 10 * $0.5
Total cost = 300 * $0.5
Total cost = $150

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $240 - $150
Profit = $90

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them up.

Larry has 3 cats.

He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add up the number of each type of pet: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The final answer is: 47"
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices both Abby and Josh can eat per day. 

Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day. 

Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day.

To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to divide the total number of slices (24) by the number of slices they eat per day (6).

24 / 6 = 4

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To find out how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and has been collecting every month, we need to calculate the number of months from her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday.

From 5 to 10 years old is 5 years. There are 12 months in a year, so 5 years is equal to 5 x 12 = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell every month, she will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we first need to determine how many cups of tea are in each row. 

Lana has 27 cups of tea in total and divides them into 3 rows. So, the number of cups in each row is 27 / 3 = 9 cups.

Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row is also 9 / 2 = 4.5. However, since you can't have half a cup of tea, this means that the number of mint tea cups in each row must be 4 or 5. 

However, if there were 4 mint tea cups in each row, then there would be 4 chamomile tea cups in each row, and the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 4 = 12. This leaves 27 - 12 - 12 = 3 cups of tea for the cinnamon tea, which is not enough to make 15 cups of cinnamon tea.

If there were 5 mint tea cups in each row, then there would be 4 chamomile tea cups in each row, and the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 5 = 15. This leaves 27 - 15 - 15 = -3 cups of tea, which is not possible.

"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to first determine how many trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes the sloth 4 hours to make a round trip, he can make 8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips in 8 hours.

Since he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and he makes 2 trips, he needs to collect 24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip.

"To find the amount of water in the tank after 6 days, we need to first determine how much water is initially filled in the tank. Since they fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, the tank will have 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons of water.

Next, we need to find out how much water is used from the tank in 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so in 6 days, it will be emptied by 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

Now, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find the remaining water: 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

"To find out how many movies Colby can see, we need to first calculate how much money he has left. 

Colby's monthly budget is $150. He has already spent:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Colby has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 and he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can see 1 more movie on a Friday or Saturday with the remaining money. 

The cost of popcorn and candy is $8 + $2 = $10. He can afford to buy these items and still have $20 - $10 = $10 left.

With the remaining $10, he can see 1 more movie on a day other than Friday or Saturday, since tickets for other days cost $7.

In total, Colby can see 5 (already seen on Fridays/Saturdays) + 1 (on a Friday) + 1 (on a day other than Friday/Saturday) = 7 movies.

"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to first find the calories of a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we can find the total calories of the pastries by multiplying the number of mini cinnamon rolls by their calories and the number of mini blueberry muffins by their calories, then adding the two results together.

Total calories of mini cinnamon rolls = 200 * 200 = 40,000
Total calories of mini blueberry muffins = 150 * 300 = 45,000

Total calories of all pastries = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and John's age as J. 

We are given that Pp = J + 10. 
We are also given that P = Pp + J. 
We are also given that P + Pp + J = 100.

Substituting Pp = J + 10 into the equation P = Pp + J, we get P = (J + 10) + J, which simplifies to P = 2J + 10.

Substituting P = 2J + 10 and Pp = J + 10 into the equation P + Pp + J = 100, we get (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100.

Simplifying the equation, we get 4J + 20 = 100.

Subtracting 20 from both sides, we get 4J = 80.

Dividing both sides by 4, we get J = 20.

Now that we know J = 20, we can find Pp = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.

Finally, we can find P = Pp + J = 30 + 20 = 50.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 * 3 = 15

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many tables they need, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so they have 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. 
They already have 10 boxes, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

They can fit 2 boxes per table, so they need 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

They already own 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 more tables.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then divide it by the number of seeds they spat.

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both of them is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

They spat a total of 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

The average total distance spat is 820 / 75 = 10.93 feet.

The final answer is: 10.93"
"To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then multiply that by the price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine:

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Now, let's find the difference in revenue:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The final answer is: $64,800"
"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay with the 24-hour option and the cost of his stay with the 12-hour option plus the additional hours.

Cameron stays for 17 hours (from 5 pm to 10 am the next day). 

The 24-hour option costs 1600 pesos. 

The 12-hour option costs 1000 pesos. For the additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5), Cameron will pay 5 * 70 = 350 pesos. 

So, the total cost with the 12-hour option plus additional hours is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

The difference between the two options is 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron would save is 250 pesos."
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. 
3 pounds less than 10 pounds is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the hay needed for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The final answer is: 159"
"To find out how much John earned, we need to multiply his hourly wage by the number of hours he worked: 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spent 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he will have 250 - 100 = 150 dollars left.

He buys 5 pencils for 10 dollars each, so the total cost of pencils is 5 * 10 = 50 dollars. 

After buying pencils, he has 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left.

He wants to buy pens that cost 25 dollars each. To find out how many pens he can buy, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost of a pen: 100 / 25 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 20 * 15 = 300.

Since Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, we add 50 to the total number of letters Craig spelled: 300 + 50 = 350.

Craig's brother's total number of letters is 350. To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the total number of letters Craig spelled to the total number of letters his brother spelled: 300 + 350 = 650.

The final answer is: 650"
"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows and then multiply the result by the number of schools.

Number of children in each row: 8

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to first calculate the total number of bottles given to the students. 

There are 29 students and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles the teacher can get is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher can get: 900 - 58 = 842.

The final answer is: 842"
"To find the total charge, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the parts cost and the initial visit charge.

Labor cost: 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75
Parts cost: $60
Initial visit charge: $40

Total charge = Labor cost + Parts cost + Initial visit charge
Total charge = $78.75 + $60 + $40
Total charge = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we need to calculate the original price and then subtract the discount. 

Original price of 10 CDs = 10 * $15 = $150
Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60
Price after discount = $150 - $60 = $90

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each, so he made a total of:
5 * $40 = $200

Since he spent $90 and made $200, he made a profit of $200 - $90 = $110.

However, the question asks how much money he was out, which implies he made a loss. Since he made a profit of $110, he was actually out $110."
"To find out how much Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of root crop and then add them together.

For yams: 6 yams * $1.5 = $9
For sweet potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes * $2 = $20
For carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25 = $5

Now, let's add the earnings from each type of root crop together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total time it took James to get across the lake, we need to break down the problem into steps.

1. First, we need to find the distance James swam before stopping. Since he swam 60% of the 20-mile lake, we can calculate this as:
   60% of 20 miles = 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles

2. Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, we can find the time it took him to swim 12 miles as:
   Time = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / 2 mph = 6 hours

3. Since James rested for half as long as the swimming time, we can find the resting time as:
   Resting time = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

4. After resting, James has 20 - 12 = 8 miles left to swim. Since he swims at half the speed (1 mph), we can find the time it took him to swim the remaining distance as:
   Time = Distance / Speed = 8 miles / 1 mph = 8 hours

5. Finally, we can find the total time it took James to get across the lake by adding the swimming time, resting time, and the time it took him to swim the remaining distance:
   Total time = 6 hours (swimming) + 3 hours (resting) + 8 hours (swimming) = 17 hours

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday and then subtract 40 from that result.

Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had, so we subtract 40 from 490: 490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to subtract the stickers she lost from the stickers she initially received, and then add the stickers she got for helping her classmates.

Jasmine initially received 15 stickers.
She lost 7 stickers, so we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8
Then, she got 5 more stickers for helping her classmates, so we add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13

Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end."
"To find the total commission earned by Cayley, we need to calculate the commission from the sales of the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal separately and then add them together.

Commission from New York Times: 
- Number of copies sold: 6
- Price per copy: $5
- Commission rate: 10%
- Commission per copy: 10% of $5 = 0.1 * $5 = $0.5
- Total commission from New York Times: 6 * $0.5 = $3

Commission from Wall Street Journal: 
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Price per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%
- Commission per copy: 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.2

1. Deanna is 26 years old.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.
3. Marcus is half of Leo's age, so Leo's age is twice Marcus's age. 

To find Leo's age, we multiply Marcus's age by 2: 21 * 2 = 42.

"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D. 

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. 

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can set A + 20 = D + 10. 

We also know that B + A + D = 45. 

We can substitute B = A + 20 into the equation B + A + D = 45, which gives us (A + 20) + A + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2A + D + 20 = 45. 

We can also substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B + A + D = 45, which gives us (D + 10) + A + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2D + A + 10 = 45. 

Now we have two equations: 2A + D + 20 = 45 and 2D + A + 10 = 45. 

We can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate A: (2A + D + 20) - (2D + A + 10) = 45 - 45. 

This simplifies to A - D + 10 = 0. 

We can rearrange the equation to get A - D = -10. 

Now we can add D to both sides to get A = D - 10. 

We can substitute A = D - 10 into the equation B = A + 20, which gives us B = (D - 10) + 20. 

This simplifies to B = D + 10. 

We know that B = D + 10 and B + A + D = 45. 

We can substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B + A + D = 45, which gives us (D + 10) + A + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2D + A + 10 = 45. 

We can substitute A = D - 10 into the equation 2D + A + 10 = 45, which gives us 2D + (D - 10) + 10 = 45. 

This simplifies to 3D = 45. 

We can divide both sides by 3 to get D = 15. 

Now that we know D = 15, we can substitute D = 15 into the equation A = D - 10, which gives us A = 15 - 10. 

This simplifies to A = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is 100 pages to the inch and each paper is printed on both sides, we have 200 pages per inch (100 pages per inch * 2 sides).

The book is 1.5 inches thick, so we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:

200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked:
11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 15 hours by 60:
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:
900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 sets

Since Vince staples 30 reports per set, we multiply the number of sets by the number of reports per set:
60 sets * 30 reports/set = 1800 reports

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up earlier.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she usually sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

She went to sleep at 10 p.m. and woke up at 5:55 a.m., so she was asleep for 5:55 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 7 hours and 55 minutes. Converting this to minutes, we get 7 * 60 + 55 = 455 minutes.

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find out how many minutes she slept on her bed that day, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up earlier from the total sleep time. So, 480 - 23 - 5 = 452 minutes.

The final answer is: 452"
"To find the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially, we need to first find out how many measuring spoons he has in relation to the measuring cups. 

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen (24) measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

Measuring spoons = (2/3) * Measuring cups
Measuring spoons = (2/3) * 24
Measuring spoons = 16

So, Jonathan initially has 16 measuring spoons.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with:

Measuring spoons remaining = Initial measuring spoons - Measuring spoons gifted
Measuring spoons remaining = 16 - 6
Measuring spoons remaining = 10

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the measuring spoons and measuring cups:
Total utensils remaining = Measuring spoons remaining + Measuring cups
Total utensils remaining = 10 + 24
Total utensils remaining = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the number of occupied beds initially, we need to calculate 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital.

Total capacity = 1000 beds
Occupied beds initially = 1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to find the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is equal to 14 days.

Total patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

Now, we need to find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks. We add the initial occupied beds to the total patients admitted.

Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = 200 beds + 700 patients = 900 beds

Since the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, we can find the total number of unoccupied beds by subtracting the total occupied beds from the total capacity.

Total unoccupied beds = Total capacity - Total occupied beds
= 1000 beds - 900 beds
= 100 beds

"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to first find out how many emails are not work-related. 

Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. So, 6 emails are to family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after subtracting the family emails from the non-work emails. 9 - 6 = 3.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

"To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to first determine the total number of holes at the end of the first day and then calculate the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day. 

On the second day, they dug 13 holes, making the total 10 + 13 = 23 holes. 

On the third day, they dug 8 holes and filled in 2, making the total 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes. 

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, there were 4 * 10 = 40 holes at the end of the fourth day. 

To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day: 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got as x. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so we can set up the equation:

x = 70

Since Collins got x + 15 corn chips, we can set up the equation:

x + 15 = 70 + 15 (since Collins got 15 more than the others)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 15 = 85

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get:

x = 70

Now that we know x, we can find the total number of corn chips. Since Amora and Lainey got x corn chips each, and Collins got x + 15 corn chips, the total number of corn chips is:

Total = 2x + (x + 15)
Total = 3x + 15
Total = 3(70) + 15
Total = 210 + 15
Total = 225

"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L. 

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so A + S + L = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so L = S + 5.

We also know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so S = 4A - 13.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation: A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 13 + 5) = 339.

Combine like terms: A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339.

Combine like terms again: 9A - 21 = 339.

Add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Divide both sides by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

Distance traveled in the southerly direction for the first 10 hours = speed * time = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles
Distance traveled in the northerly direction for 2 hours = speed * time = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles
Distance traveled in the southerly direction for the last 5 hours = speed * time = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Total distance traveled in the southerly direction = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles
Distance traveled in the northerly direction = 36 miles

Since the bird ends up at her southern home, we need to subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction to find the distance between the two homes.
Distance between the bird's northern and southern homes = Total distance traveled in the southerly direction - Distance traveled in the northerly direction
= 410 miles - 36 miles

"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we need to multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form).

Nani's sister's age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together: Nani's age + brother's age + sister's age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: 33"
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).

Given the length (L) is 15 feet and the width (W) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first determine how many boxes she had left after giving some to her mom and sister. 

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, so she gave away a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. 

Now, she has 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left. 

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges in 8 boxes is 8 * 20 = 160 oranges.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges. 

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total number of states in both countries, we first need to determine the number of states in the USA and India. 

The USA has 50 states. 

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Half of 50 is 25, and 4 more than that is 25 + 4 = 29.

Now, we add the number of states in the USA and India together: 50 + 29 = 79.

The final answer is: 79"
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, he still needs to earn $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can find the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the amount he still needs to earn ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 / $5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we first need to determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can set up an equation: 

Robert's cherries = Richard's cherries + 10
30 = Richard's cherries + 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has. Since the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 and 20 cherries respectively, we can find Jerry's cherries by subtracting their total from the total number of cherries:

Total cherries = Robert's cherries + Richard's cherries + Jerry's cherries
60 = 30 + 20 + Jerry's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 30 - 20
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.
- On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so G = 10.
- On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so A = Sunday's apple pie - 4.
- On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so Sunday's gingerbread = G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.
- On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's find the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday:
A = Sunday's apple pie - 4
15 = Sunday's apple pie - 4
Sunday's apple pie = 15 + 4 = 19
A = 19 - 4 = 15

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on Saturday and Sunday:
- Saturday: G = 10, A = 15
- Sunday: G = 15, A = 19

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for Saturday and Sunday:
- Saturday's earnings: 10 * $6 (gingerbread) + 15 * $15 (apple pie) = $60 + $225 = $285
- Sunday's earnings: 15 * $6 (gingerbread) + 19 * $15 (apple pie) = $90 + $285 = $375
- Total earnings for two days: $285 + $375 = $660

The final answer is: $660"
"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use. 

She reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day. So, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day. 

Since she will be on vacation for 8 days, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day for 8 days, which is 4 * 8 = 32 times.

Each time she reapplies sunscreen, she uses 1 ounce. So, she will use 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.

Since each bottle of sunscreen is 8 ounces, we need to divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces) to find out how many bottles she will need.

32 / 8 = 4

So, Pamela will need 4 bottles of sunscreen. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

Price of blue car = $100
Discount = 40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40

Price of red car = Price of blue car - Discount
= $100 - $40
= $60

So, the price of the red car is $60.

The total cost of both cars is the sum of their prices:
Total cost = Price of blue car + Price of red car
= $100 + $60
= $160

The final answer is: $160"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is 19 years old now.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

From point 3, we can deduce that Emil's brother is currently half of Emil's age when Emil turns 24. Since Emil is 19 now, when he turns 24, he will be 24 - 19 = 5 years older. So, his brother's age when Emil turns 24 will be 5 / 2 = 2.5 years. 

Now, we know that when Emil turns 24, his brother will be 2.5 years old. This means his brother is currently 2.5 - 5 = -2.5 years old when Emil is 19. However, age cannot be negative, so this is a logical contradiction. This means that the initial assumption that Emil's brother is half of Emil's age when Emil turns 24 is incorrect.

However, let's re-evaluate the information given. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means his dad's age when Emil turns 24 will be 24 * 2 = 48 years.

Now, let's assume Emil's brother's age when Emil turns 24 is x. Then, Emil's brother's current age is x - 5 (since Emil is 5 years older than his brother when he turns 24). 

We know that when Emil turns 24, his brother will be x years old, and his dad will be 48 years old. Since Emil is 19 now, his dad's current age is 48 - 5 = 43 years, and his brother's current age is x - 5.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. This means that 24 = 2 * (x). Solving for x, we get x = 12.

Now that we know x, we can find Emil's brother's current age: x - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7.

We can now find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother: 43 (dad's age) + 7 (brother's age) = 50.

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to add the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (mother) + 30 (sister) + 40 (friend) = 90 beads.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the number of football players, we need to calculate 20% of 30 students. 
20% of 30 = 0.2 * 30 = 6 students.

The remaining students are 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Now, we need to find 25% of the remaining students who are cheerleaders or part of the band.
25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

The total number of students leaving early is the sum of football players and cheerleaders/band members.
6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders/band members) = 12 students.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie's boots are size 5, Charlie's boots are 5 * 5 = 25.

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is the sum of their sizes divided by 2. So, (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to first convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches, since the width of the plants is given in inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches, so 111 feet = 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Now, we need to subtract the space between the plants. Since there are 17 plants, there will be 16 spaces between them. The total space between the plants is 16 * 1.5 = 24 feet, which is 24 * 12 = 288 inches.

Now, we subtract the total space between the plants from the total length of the flower bed: 1332 - 288 = 1044 inches.

Since each plant is 12 inches wide, we divide the total available space by the width of each plant: 1044 / 12 = 87.

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so we subtract 17 from the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed: 87 - 17 = 70.

Now, we multiply the number of plants Pat needs to buy by the cost of each plant: 70 * 6 = 420.

The final answer is: 420"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate 1/2 of 18. 

1/2 of 18 is 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats per day by 7.

9 pretzels/day * 7 days = 63 pretzels

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00
The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Total cost = cost of petunias + cost of sweet potato vines = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations. 

4 sunflowers need 4 * 3 = 12 pounds of soil.
10 carnations need 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil.

The total amount of soil used for sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have a 30-pound bag of soil, the remaining soil for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so they can plant 3 / 1 = 3 roses.

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate how much she saves each month and then multiply it by 12.

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets 25% of her paycheck aside for shoes. 
25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 x $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since she saves $500.00 each month, in a year (12 months) she will save 12 x $500.00 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so she can buy $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: peeling and cooking. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to cook 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 30 = 3 times 10 minutes. Since she can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, she can cook 90 shrimp in 3 * 10 = 30 minutes.

However, since peeling and cooking are done sequentially, we need to add the time it takes for both tasks. So, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature. 

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

However, the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is not running. Since the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. 

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. 
2. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. 
   Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.
3. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the time between Bill's two sightings of the comet is 75 years.
4. To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to subtract 75 from his age at the second sighting. 
   Bill's age at the second sighting = 90 years
   Bill's age at the first sighting = 90 - 75 = 15 years

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and add them up.

1. Electric bill: 1 check per month = 12 checks per year
2. Gas bill: 1 check per month = 12 checks per year
3. Church: 2 checks per month = 24 checks per year
4. Pest and lawn service: 1 check every 3 months (quarterly) = 4 checks per year

"To find the number of flights to France, we first need to determine the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 flights.

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is (3/4) * 88 = 66. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/2) * (88 - 66) = (1/2) * 22 = 11.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, Adam had to contribute $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings.

"Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. The total age of the children is 20, and we know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro. 

The total age of the children can be expressed as: 
Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20
3 + 4 + Helene's age + W = 20

Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. 
Average age = (3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4
Helene's age = 2 * ((3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4)

We can simplify the equation by substituting the expression for Helene's age:
Helene's age = 2 * ((3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4)
Helene's age = (2 * (7 + Helene's age + W)) / 4
Helene's age = (14 + 2 * Helene's age + 2W) / 4
4 * Helene's age = 14 + 2 * Helene's age + 2W
2 * Helene's age - Helene's age = 14 + 2W
Helene's age = 14 + 2W

Now we can substitute the expression for Helene's age into the first equation:
3 + 4 + (14 + 2W) + W = 20
17 + 3W = 20
3W = 3
W = 1

"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 

Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend gives him $200, but this is not included in the amount that the lawyer will donate. The lawyer will donate based on the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund.

So, the amount that the lawyer will donate is 3 times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, which is 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find the total number of cookies, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of cookies each guest brought. 

Total cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

Since the bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church, we need to find 1/2 of 1500.

1/2 of 1500 = 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got.

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

"To solve this problem, let's assume the total number of slices of the watermelon is 6 (since there are 6 people in the family). 

Let's say each kid gets 'x' slices. Since each adult gets twice as much as each kid, each adult gets 2x slices.

We know that the total number of slices is 6, so the sum of the slices each kid and each adult gets is equal to 6. 

Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, we can write the equation as: 2(2x) + 4x = 6

Simplifying the equation, we get: 4x + 4x = 6
Combine like terms: 8x = 6
Divide both sides by 8: x = 6/8 = 0.75

Since each kid gets 0.75 slices, each adult gets 2x = 2(0.75) = 1.5 slices.

The total number of slices is 6, so the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (1.5/6) * 100 = 25%

"To find out how much time Doctor Jones will spend on rounds, we need to multiply the number of inpatients by the time spent per inpatient. 

9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

To find out how much time Doctor Jones will spend on appointments, we need to multiply the number of appointments by the time spent per appointment.

10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Converting 300 minutes to hours:

300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

Now, we need to add the time spent on rounds and appointments to find the total time spent at the clinic.

3 hours (rounds) + 5 hours (appointments) = 8 hours

Since Doctor Jones works 9 hours at the clinic, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours worked to find the time left to update his records.

9 hours (total hours worked) - 8 hours (time spent) = 1 hour

Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:
180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Jordan needs to start making the cake 3 hours before 5:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. The total number of boxes sold is 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together and they sold 8 boxes, we can find the number of chocolate bars in a box by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes.

Number of chocolate bars in a box = Total number of chocolate bars / Total number of boxes

"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. So, the total number of sessions in a month is 3 sessions/day * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

The total cost per session is $40, and there are 12 sessions in a month. So, the total cost per month is $40 * 12 = $480.

"To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5. 

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of babies born in a month is 30 * 4 = 120.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the initial population plus the number of babies born in a year. 

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed, we do the following:

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon:

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

"To find out how many miles each person traveled, we need to multiply their speed by the time they traveled.

Matteo's distance = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles
Shandy's distance = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we need to find the difference between their distances to see how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo.
Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we need to first find the number of students over 16 and under 16, and then find the number of female students in each group.

1. Total students = 3000
2. Students over 16 = 3000 / 2 = 1500
3. Male students over 16 = 1500 / 4 = 375
4. Female students over 16 = 1500 - 375 = 1125
5. Students under 16 = 3000 / 2 = 1500
6. Male students under 16 = 1500 / 2 = 750
7. Female students under 16 = 1500 - 750 = 750

Now, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16 to find the total number of female students:
Female students = 1125 + 750 = 1875

The final answer is: 1875"
"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. To do this, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. The total amount of water in the tank after the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons. The total amount of water in the tank after the second day is 7875 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so the amount of water remaining is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x%.

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is x - 5 * 9 = x - 45%.

In the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining is (x - 45) - 3 * 7 = x - 45 - 21 = x - 66%.

We are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. We can set up the equation:

x - 66 = 28

To solve for x, we add 66 to both sides of the equation:

x = 28 + 66
x = 94

The charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%."
"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work, we first need to calculate her total weekly income. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and she works 40 hours a week, so her weekly wage is 10 * 40 = $400.

She also makes $15 an hour from tips, so her total weekly income from tips is 15 * 40 = $600.

Her total weekly income is the sum of her wage and tips, which is 400 + 600 = $1000.

The down payment for the car is $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of this amount. 20% of $10,000 is 0.2 * 10000 = $2000.

To find out how many weeks she needs to work, we divide the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her total weekly income ($1000). 

2000 / 1000 = 2

So, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate how much money he has left after purchasing the other fruits. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he has already purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Now, let's calculate how many plums he can buy with the remaining money:
Plums cost $0.25 each, so the number of plums he can buy is $0.75 / $0.25 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. Since she kept 2 packs for herself, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Next, we need to find out how many packs each friend received. Since there are 10 friends, we divide the total number of packs given away (13) by the number of friends (10). 

13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend.

Since each pack has 60 pieces, we multiply the number of packs each friend received by the number of pieces in each pack.

1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces.

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to first find the number of pictures in each album. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures (72) by the number of albums (8) to get the number of pictures in each album.

72 / 8 = 9

So, each album has 9 pictures. 

Since 3 albums were selfies only, the total number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27.

Since 2 albums were portraits, the total number of portraits is 2 * 9 = 18.

The final answer is: 
Selfies: 27
Portraits: 18"
"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read one set of 3 pages.

Since James reads 18 pages, we can divide 18 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pages he reads: 18 / 3 = 6.

Since it takes James 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages, we can multiply the number of sets by the time it takes to read one set: 6 * 10 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the remaining guests are 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests who have checked out is 24 + 15 = 39.

The number of guests who have not checked out is 76 - 39 = 37.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30.

So, the total number of guests who have checked in is 30 (in the afternoon) + 7 (after dinner) = 37.

Now, we add the number of guests who have checked in to the number of guests who have not checked out: 37 (checked in) + 37 (not checked out) = 74.

The final answer is: 74"
"To find out how many bananas John has, we need to calculate the total number of bananas he picked. 

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas. 
On Thursday, John picked 6 bananas.

"To find the number of points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions, and then find the number of correct answers for each type.

First, let's find the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:
- Total questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24
- Average and difficult questions: 60 - 24 = 36
- Since the rest are equally divided as average and difficult questions, we have: 
  - Average questions: 36 / 2 = 18
  - Difficult questions: 36 / 2 = 18

Now, let's find the number of correct answers for each type:
- Easy questions: Aries is sure to get 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18
- Average questions: Aries is sure to get half of 18 = 18 / 2 = 9
- Difficult questions: Aries is sure to get half of 18 = 18 / 2 = 9

Now, let's add up the number of correct answers:
18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's assume the price of a small stuffed animal is x. Since large stuffed animals cost three times as much, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3x.
2. Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so if she sold L large stuffed animals, she sold 2L small stuffed animals.
3. The total amount earned from the sales is $120. The total amount earned from small stuffed animals is 2L * 4 = 8L (since each small stuffed animal costs $4). The total amount earned from large stuffed animals is L * 3x = 3Lx.
4. The total amount earned from both types of stuffed animals is the sum of the amounts earned from each type: 8L + 3Lx = 120.
5. Since the price of a small stuffed animal is x, we can substitute x = 4 into the equation: 8L + 3L(4) = 120.
6. Simplify the equation: 8L + 12L = 120.
7. Combine like terms: 20L = 120.
8. Divide both sides by 20: L = 6.

Since L represents the number of large stuffed animals sold, and Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2L = 2(6) = 12.

"To find the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches they eat per day and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 

Total sandwiches per day = 5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

Now, multiply the total sandwiches per day by 7 (days in a week):
11 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches/week

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 2 * 12 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Next, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. Since he can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. Since one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days with steel pickaxes. Since they can mine 1440 pounds of ore per day, they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore in 30 days.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The ratio for the first package is 3/2, and for the second package is 6/4. 

To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers in each ratio by their greatest common divisor. 

For the first package, the greatest common divisor of 3 and 2 is 1, so the ratio remains 3/2. 

For the second package, the greatest common divisor of 6 and 4 is 2, so the ratio simplifies to 3/2.

Since the ratios are the same (3/2), the price is directly proportional to the number of sandwiches. 

Now, we can set up a proportion to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches. Let x be the price of the package with 8 sandwiches.

(3/2) = (x/8)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

3 * 8 = 2x
24 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2:

x = 24/2
x = 12

The price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to subtract the amount he paid from the total cost of the bedroom set.

First, let's calculate the amount Tom paid from his old bedroom set: 
$3000 (total cost) - $1000 (amount paid) = $2000 (remaining amount to be paid)

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we need to convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 
10% = 10 / 100 = 0.1

Now, we multiply the remaining amount by the decimal to find the monthly payment: 
$2000 * 0.1 = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 x 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so she released 6 yellow balloons, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 x 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's add up the remaining balloons: 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons. 

15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

The final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 34."
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). 

However, the third scenario is dependent on the second scenario not happening, so we need to multiply the probabilities. 

The probability that the normal teacher doesn't give an extension is 100% - 40% = 60%. 

The probability that Marcus convinces the teacher his dog ate his assignment is 20% of 60%, which is 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12 or 12%.

The total probability that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework is 50% + 40% + 12% = 0.5 + 0.4 + 0.12 = 0.98 or 98%.

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 100% - 98% = 2%.

First, we know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

We are also given that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. This means that 1 medium-sized bean is equal to 3 small beans. 

Now, we can find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat by multiplying the number of medium-sized beans he can eat by 3. 

150 medium-sized beans * 3 small beans/medium-sized bean = 450 small beans

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and lost income while in school. 

The total amount of loans he took is 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000.

The amount of money he lost while in school is 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000.

The total amount of money he needs to earn is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After college, his income triples, so he now earns $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

To find out how long it will take him to earn the total amount of $300,000, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102. 
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 
5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209. 
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

The share of the first person is $420."
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

First, let's convert 3 weeks to days: 3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to find the fraction of a day in hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 of a day is (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

Combine like terms:

(2x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2(2x + 4) + x = 38

Expand the equation:

4x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

Initial price of the car = $20,000
Depreciation rate = 21% per year

Year 2008:
Price in 2008 = Initial price - (Initial price * depreciation rate)
= $20,000 - ($20,000 * 0.21)
= $20,000 - $4,200
= $15,800

Year 2009:
Price in 2009 = Price in 2008 - (Price in 2008 * depreciation rate)
= $15,800 - ($15,800 * 0.21)
= $15,800 - $3,328
= $12,472

Year 2010:
Price in 2010 = Price in 2009 - (Price in 2009 * depreciation rate)
= $12,472 - ($12,472 * 0.21)
= $12,472 - $2,620.32
= $9,851.68

The price of the car in 2010 is $9,851.68."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to find the total number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

10% of the books are written in German, so that's 10% of 50, which is 0.1 x 50 = 5 books in German.

The total number of books written in English and German is 25 + 5 = 30.

Since there are 50 books in total, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

Total distance = 1955 kilometers

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate how many cups of water she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. 
So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can divide the total cups by 16 to find out the total gallons. 
240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to calculate the number of people at each stop and add them up.

Initially, Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the total number of people becomes:
120 + 20 = 140

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100) board the train. So, the total number of people becomes:
140 - 50 + 100 = 190

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the total number of people becomes:
190 - 80 = 110

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"To find the total amount Alison spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55

The final answer is: $55"
"To find the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, we need to find the area of each tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of each tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Next, we need to find the total number of tiles required to cover the kitchen floor. Since the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt and each tile covers 1 SqFt, we need 200 tiles.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost of each tile: 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72
Increased cost = $120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we need to multiply it by 12.

Annual cost = $192 * 12 = $2304

The final answer is: $2304"
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since a twin bed has 1 set of sheets and a king size bed has 1 set of sheets, the total number of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 + 1 = 5.

Since he can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we need to convert the number of twin sets to king sets. 4 twin sets is equivalent to 2 king sets (since 2 twin sets = 1 king set). So, the total number of king sets he needs to wash is 2 (from the twin sets) + 1 (from the king bed) = 3.

Now, we can calculate the number of loads of laundry he does in a week. Since he needs to wash 3 king sets of sheets, and he can wash 1 king set at a time, he needs 3 loads of laundry for the king sets. He also needs to wash 2 twin sets, but he can wash 2 twin sets at a time, so he only needs 1 load of laundry for the twin sets.

In total, Greg does 3 + 1 = 4 loads of laundry in a week.

To find out how many loads of laundry he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads he does in a week by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so Greg does 4 * 52 = 208 loads of laundry in a year.

The final answer is: 208"
"To find the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and multiply it by 4.

They watch 4 movies on Saturday. 
They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

In 4 weeks, they will watch 6 * 4 = 24 movies.

"To find out how many stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he collected over the past three years.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.
This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.
So, this year he has 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

Now, let's add up the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection: 100 (two years ago) + 50 (last year) + 250 (this year) = 400 stickers.

"To find out how many slices each person ate, we need to start with the information that Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, Silvia must have eaten 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, we know that Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. To find the total number of slices they ate, we add these numbers together: 10 + 7 + 14 = 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"Let's denote the time Donovan took as D and the time Betsy took as B. We know that B = D + 18 and the total time is 98 minutes, so D + B = 98. 

Substituting B = D + 18 into the second equation, we get D + (D + 18) = 98. Simplifying this, we get 2D + 18 = 98. Subtracting 18 from both sides, we get 2D = 80. Dividing both sides by 2, we get D = 40.

Now that we know Donovan took 40 minutes, we can find Betsy's time by adding 18 to Donovan's time: B = 40 + 18 = 58.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the costs of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The cost of the visit is $300/hour for 0.5 hours (30 minutes). So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of parking is $6/hour for 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: 
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

"To find the total number of pizzas left, we first need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 is 0.7 x 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. 
They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 x 40 = 32 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 (by the glee club) + 32 (by the football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 (by the glee club) + 40 (by the football team) = 60 pizzas.

The number of pizzas left is 60 (total pizzas) - 46 (pizzas eaten) = 14 pizzas.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

He wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, so he will send out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of guests and then add the rental fee. 

First, let's find the total number of guests: 
Kayla invited 25 classmates + 7 dance class girls + 13 family members = 45 guests. 
However, 4 people said they could not come, so we subtract 4 from the total: 45 - 4 = 41 guests.

Since the first 20 guests are included in the rental fee, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests: 
41 guests - 20 guests = 21 additional guests. 
The cost for the additional guests is 21 * $6 = $126.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat each day. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys in total, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats. However, we know that the total number of bananas they eat each day is equal to the total number of bananas Mr. Robles buys divided by 7 (since they eat for a week). 

So, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 315 / 7 = 45 bananas.

Now we can set up an equation to find the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day:

"To find out how much Jenny paid for the roses, we need to determine if she bought the roses by the dozen or individually. 

Since she bought 15 roses, it's more cost-effective for her to buy a dozen (12 roses) and 3 individual roses. 

A dozen roses cost $15, and 3 individual roses cost 3 * $2 = $6. 

So, the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she paid with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

Jenny leaves with 16 quarters."

"To find out how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time he needs to wait for the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. Since Paul is at the station at the start, he needs to wait until the fourth train arrives, which is 145 minutes.

Therefore, Paul will wait for 145 minutes for his train.

"To find out how many more weeks Melanie needs to save toothpicks, we first need to determine how many toothpicks she has saved so far. 

Melanie saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. 
So, the total number of toothpicks saved = 10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks.

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks in total, and she already has 120, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to save. 
Number of toothpicks needed = 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks.

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week. To find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks needed by the number of toothpicks saved per week.
Number of weeks needed = 80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is:

$2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so the price his friend paid is:

$1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price his friend paid, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100:

Discount = (($2000 - $1800) / $2000) * 100
Discount = ($200 / $2000) * 100

"To find out how much Jenny saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and compare it to the cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be: 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost would be: 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

To find out how much Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

"To find out how much fence each person gets, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet of fence.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. To find out how much is left over, we need to subtract the total amount of fence Sam and Harry have from the total amount of fence:

Total fence - (Sam's fence + Harry's fence)
= 100 - (20 + (20 + 60))
= 100 - 100
= 0

However, this is not the correct interpretation of the question. The question asks how much is left over for Sam, implying that there is some leftover fence after they have taken their respective portions. Since they have taken 100 feet of fence, there is no leftover fence."

Let's break down the information:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Total earnings: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck, and then subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

The total number of bales made is 30, and the total number of bales picked up is 18. 

To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we first need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class per day. 

There are 6 periods in a day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes per day is 6 * 40 = 240 minutes.

Since John goes to class for 5 days a week, the total minutes he spends in class per week is 240 * 5 = 1200 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. 1/16 of his weekly minutes is (1/16) * 1200 = 75 minutes.

The total minutes he spends learning per week is the sum of the minutes he spends in class and the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. So, the total minutes per week is 1200 + 75 = 1275 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. So, the total hours per week is 1275 / 60 = 21.25 hours.

The final answer is: 21.25"
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is the height of the third floor, which is 24 feet.

The height of the ball after the first bounce is 2/3 of the initial height:
(2/3) * 24 = 16 feet

The height of the ball after the second bounce is 2/3 of the height after the first bounce:
(2/3) * 16 = 10.67 feet

The final answer is: 10.67"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to convert the height of the first child to inches and then calculate the height of each child step by step.

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the height of the first child in inches is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the height of the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the height of the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the height of the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10).

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"To find the original weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the 270 kilograms left after the Allosaurus ate.

First, the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which was half of what the velociraptors had. So, the velociraptors had 2 * 270 = 540 kilograms.

Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex, the T-Rex must have eaten half of the original weight of the triceratops. The velociraptors had 540 kilograms, which is half of what the T-Rex ate. So, the T-Rex ate 2 * 540 = 1080 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the original weight of the triceratops must have been 2 * 1080 = 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To find the total area to be painted, we need to calculate the area of all four walls. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet.
The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet.
The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the total number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so 3 were shaken and 9 were unshaken. Ellen took 1 unshaken soda, leaving 8 unshaken and 3 shaken sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

The total number of sodas left is 2 (shaken) + 6 (unshaken) = 8.

The probability of Ellen's friend getting a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas: 2/8 = 0.25.

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

"To find the total number of days Billy works, we first need to calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

Now, subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy works.
50 - 10 = 40

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so we need to find the total number of hours he works in a day.
2 people/hour * 3 hours = 6 people/day

Now, multiply the number of days Billy works by the number of people he can help per day.
40 days * 6 people/day = 240 people

"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people who were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people who attended the wedding.

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses:
12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars:
20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the total number of people who attended the wedding is the sum of the people inside the church and the people outside, we can assume that the number of people outside the church is the sum of the number of cars and buses, which is 20 + 12 = 32 people.

So, the total number of people who attended the wedding is 32 people (outside the church) + 480 people (inside the church) = 512 people.

To find the number of people inside the church, we subtract the number of people outside the church from the total number of people who attended the wedding:
512 people - 32 people = 480 people

The final answer is: 480"
"To find Jeff's age, we need to first find Martha's age. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, we can calculate Jeff's age by adding 10 to Martha's age.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of each slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time = 3 minutes

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the two slides:
Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference = 2 minutes

"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 
The total time spent on breaks is 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes.
The total time spent per day is 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. 
To find the total time spent over 5 days, we multiply 1 hour by 5: 1 hour * 5 = 5 hours.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total miles run by all three is 52. We can subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after returning the item and then add it to the initial charge minus the returned item.

Initial charge: $85.00
Returned item: -$15.00
New balance after return: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Frying pan: 20% off $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Cost of frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Towels: 10% off $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Cost of towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Total cost of new purchases: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

"Let's break down the information given:

- A fifth of the jellyfish are large.
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
- The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue.
- When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. 
A third of the large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, so x/15 = 6. 

To find the total number of jellyfish, we need to solve for x:
x/15 = 6
x = 6 * 15
x = 90

Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3:
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for her retirement. 

First, let's calculate her annual expenses in retirement: 
40% of $100,000 = 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

Since she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, the total amount she needs to save is:
$40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

Now, let's calculate how much she saves per year. 
20% of $100,000 = 0.2 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

To find out how many years she needs to work to save $800,000, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by the amount she saves per year:
$800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for her retirement. Since she already plans to live for 20 years in retirement, we need to subtract this from the total number of years:
40 - 20 = 20 years.

First, we convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 40% = 40/100 = 0.4

Then, we divide the number of boys by this decimal: 240 / 0.4 = 600

This means the total population of the school is 600. 

Since 40% of the school population is boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. 

To find the number of girls, we multiply the total population by the percentage of girls: 600 * 0.6 = 360

"To find out how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

To find out how many days it will take her to hike 9,300 miles, we divide the total miles by the miles per day: 9,300 / 250 = 37.2 days.

Since she only has 30 days in June, she will not be able to complete her journey on time. To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract the number of days she has from the number of days it will take her to complete the journey: 37.2 - 30 = 7.2 days.

Since she can't hike a fraction of a day, we need to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day to complete the journey in 30 days. We can do this by dividing the remaining days by the number of days she has: 7.2 / 30 = 0.24 days. 

Since she hikes twice a day, we multiply 0.24 by 2 to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day: 0.24 * 2 = 0.48 miles per day."

"To find the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers, we first need to find the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour and the 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour produce a total of 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour produce a total of 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour.

So, the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since they work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers is 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

The manufacturer still needs 20 toys to ship the order, and the total number of toys ordered is 400. So, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Since the 4 workers produce 200 toys, the fifth worker must produce 380 - 200 = 180 toys in 10 hours.

To find the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked: 180 / 10 = 18.

Since Liam's age two years ago was twice the age of Vince, we can set up the equation: 14 = 2 * Vince's age two years ago.

To find Vince's age two years ago, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: Vince's age two years ago = 14 / 2 = 7 years.

Now, we need to find Vince's current age. Since two years have passed, we add 2 to Vince's age two years ago: Vince's current age = 7 + 2 = 9 years.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's call this number A.
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted S. Then, Camden painted S + 12 eggs.
3. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56, so we can write the equation: A + A + (S + 12) + S = 56
4. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2A + 2S + 12 = 56
5. Subtract 12 from both sides: 2A + 2S = 44
6. Divide both sides by 2: A + S = 22
7. Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we can write the equation: S + (S + 12) = 30
8. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2S + 12 = 30
9. Subtract 12 from both sides: 2S = 18
10. Divide both sides by 2: S = 9
11. Now that we know S, we can find A: A + S = 22, so A + 9 = 22, A = 13
12. Camden painted S + 12 eggs, so Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.
13. The difference between the number of eggs Camden and Arnold painted is 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total number of boxes and the total weight of the crayons and boxes.

Nik has 200 crayons and wants to put them into boxes of 8 crayons each. To find the total number of boxes, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box:

200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces and there are 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is:

25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and Nik has 200 crayons, so the total weight of the crayons is:

200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces

The total weight of the crayons and boxes is the sum of their individual weights:

200 ounces (boxes) + 200 ounces (crayons) = 400 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16:

400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to calculate 80% of 80 feet. 

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet long, we need to divide the total length of the usable tree by the length of each log.

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each log, John cuts 5 planks. So, the total number of planks he can make is:

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2. To find the total amount he makes, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank:

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find the salary of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, and her brother earns 2 times her salary, so her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so their mother earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out Grandma's speed on the beach and on the sidewalk. 

Let's assume Grandma's speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she spends 40 minutes on the beach. 

The time it takes to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/x. The time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/(2x).

Since the total time spent on the beach is 40 minutes, we can set up the equation: 2/x = 40.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by x, which gives us 2 = 40x. Then, we can divide both sides by 40, which gives us x = 1/20.

Now that we know Grandma's speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2(1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

The time it takes to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/(1/20) = 40 minutes. The time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/(1/10) = 10 minutes.

The total time it takes to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save $60, we need to first calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is:
$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60:
$60 (target) - $32 (already saved) = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree. 

3 trees had 7 blue birds each, so 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.
2 trees had 4 blue birds each, so 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.
1 tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 marbles. So, Bob currently has 60 - 24 = 36 marbles.

2. If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, we need to subtract 10 from the current number of marbles. 

36 - 10 = 26

So, Bob will have 26 marbles."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle. 

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the two temperatures multiplied by the total ounces. 

The total ounces of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle). 

The average temperature of the two mugs is (33 + x) / 2. 

The total temperature of the water in the bottle is (33 + x) / 2 * 5. 

Since Donny can now drink the water, the total temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. 

We can set up the inequality (33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40. 

Solving for x, we get:

(33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40
(33 + x) * 5 / 2 >= 40
(33 + x) * 5 >= 80
165 + 5x >= 80
5x >= 80 - 165
5x >= -85
x >= -85 / 5
x >= -17

However, since the temperature cannot be negative, we need to find the minimum temperature that is greater than or equal to 40 degrees. 

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is y degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the two temperatures multiplied by the total ounces. 

The total ounces of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle). 

The average temperature of the two mugs is (33 + y) / 2. 

The total temperature of the water in the bottle is (33 + y) / 2 * 5. 

Since Donny can now drink the water, the total temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. 

We can set up the equation (33 + y) / 2 * 5 = 40. 

Solving for y, we get:

(33 + y) / 2 * 5 = 40
(33 + y) * 5 / 2 = 40
(33 + y) * 5 = 80
165 + 5y = 80
5y = 80 - 165
5y = -85
y = -85 / 5

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows

Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.
240 eggs / 12 = 20

"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to find the total number of red jellybeans. We know that there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans. 

So, the number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34.

We know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We already know the number of green and red jellybeans, so we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the number of green and red jellybeans from the total.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
= 60 - (17 + 34)
= 60 - 51
= 9

"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the total number of lemons he gets in a year and then multiply it by 10 (since a decade has 10 years).

First, let's find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a year:
5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

Now, let's multiply the number of lemons he gets in a year by 10 to find the total number of lemons in a decade:
30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

Given that the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can let the number of men be 5x and the number of women be 9x. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation: 5x + 9x = 84

Combine like terms: 14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14: x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of women on the bus initially: 9x = 9 * 6 = 54

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women who remained is: 54 - 20 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first find out how many sunflowers were sold in a day and then multiply it by 3.

Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers per day. Since each sunflower costs $2, the number of sunflowers sold per day is 26 / 2 = 13.

Faraday also earned $56 from the bouquets per day. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers and costs $8, the number of bouquets sold per day is 56 / 8 = 7. 

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per bouquet is 12. So, the number of sunflowers sold from bouquets per day is 7 * 12 = 84.

The total number of sunflowers sold per day is 13 (from individual sunflowers) + 84 (from bouquets) = 97.

To find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days, we multiply 97 by 3: 97 * 3 = 291.

The final answer is: 291"
"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference between the two.

Adam has $100 to invest, and each rock costs $5. To find out how many rocks he can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

So, Adam buys 20 rocks.

He sells 60% of the rocks, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks.

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:
12 * $7 = $84

The cost of buying 20 rocks at $5 each is:
20 * $5 = $100

Since Adam only sells 12 rocks, he still has 8 rocks left, which he didn't sell. The cost of these unsold rocks is:
8 * $5 = $40

The total cost of the rocks is the cost of the rocks he sold plus the cost of the rocks he didn't sell:
$100 + $40 = $140

However, Adam only sold rocks for $84, so he actually spent $140 but only made $84. To find the loss, we subtract the revenue from the total cost:
$140 - $84 = $56

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days it takes to complete each type of picture scene. 

Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day, so to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes, it will take her 45 / 5 = 9 days.
She can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day, so to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes, it will take her 36 / 6 = 6 days.
She can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day, so to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes, it will take her 49 / 7 = 7 days.

The LCM of 9, 6, and 7 is 126. 

Therefore, it will take Lauren 126 days to complete all of the picture scenes.

"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total cost of food for one month. 

First, we need to determine the number of days in May. May has 31 days. 

Since each fish needs $1 worth of food a day, and Jen has 3 fish, the daily cost of food for all her fish is 3 * $1 = $3.

To find the total cost for the month of May, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.2 in decimal form. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

The probability of both tickets winning is 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. 
   Let's denote the number of seashells Carlos collected as C. Then, Jim collected C + 5 seashells.
   Since Jim collected 27 seashells, we can write the equation: C + 5 = 27.
   Solving for C, we get C = 22.

2. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. 
   Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as R. Then, Carlos collected 2R seashells.
   We already know that Carlos collected 22 seashells, so we can write the equation: 2R = 22.
   Solving for R, we get R = 11.

Now we know that Jim collected 27 seashells, Carlos collected 22 seashells, and Carrey collected 11 seashells.

They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. 
The total number of seashells is 27 + 22 + 11 = 60.
To find out how many seashells each person got, we divide the total number of seashells by 3 (the number of people):
60 / 3 = 20

"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). 
So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. 
So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to get the total number of carrots he eats in a week.
Total carrots eaten in a week = 20 (weekdays) + 10 (weekend) = 30.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (which is the decimal form of 60%).

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we have the lengths of both songs: 5 minutes for the first song and 8 minutes for the second song. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the profit from each day and then add them together.

On Monday, Linus bought 2 devices for $20 each. So, the total cost for Monday is 2 * $20 = $40. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the total revenue from Monday is 2 * $40 = $80. The profit from Monday is $80 - $40 = $40.

On Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each. So, the total cost for Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the total revenue from Tuesday is 4 * $40 = $160. The profit from Tuesday is $160 - $80 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 100 / 20 = 5 bottles.

For 2300 people, we need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the number of bottles it can produce from the total number of bottles required:

11500 - 4200 = 7300

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Since Carla has 8 babies and 3/4 of them wear purple, the number of babies wearing purple is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

Since 1/4 of the babies wear blue, the number of babies wearing blue is 1/4 * 8 = 2.

All 2 babies wearing blue also wear bows, and 1/3 of the 6 babies wearing purple also wear bows. So, the number of babies wearing purple and bows is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

The total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4.

The percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is (2/4) * 100 = 50%.

Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - (Reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)

"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. 

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. 

So far, he has sold 40 + 20 = 60 square meters. This leaves him with 80 - 60 = 20 square meters of land.

He then sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's add up the money he earned from each sale: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

"To find the total number of eggs found, we need to calculate the number of eggs each person found and add them up.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs found is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we need to convert 3 dozen to a numerical value. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is equal to 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

The number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to find the size of the third apartment complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so their combined size is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400.

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. Adding this to 400 gives 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

So, the total number of apartments is 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects from 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

- Year 1: 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
- Year 2: 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- Year 3: 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- Year 4: 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, but we don't know the production of a 10-year-old tree yet. Let's call the production of a 10-year-old tree 'x'. So, the 8-year-old tree produces x - 200 fruits.
- Year 5: The tree is still 8 years old, so it produces x - 200 fruits.
- Year 6: The tree is 9 years old, so it produces x - 200 fruits.
- Year 7: The tree is 10 years old, so it produces x fruits.
- Year 8: The tree is 11 years old, so it produces x fruits.
- Year 9: The tree is 12 years old, but it doesn't produce any fruit.
- Year 10: The tree is 13 years old, but it's actually a 10-year-old tree now, so it produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's find the value of 'x'. We know that a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 1000 fruits. So, 20 * 50 = 1000. This is the production of a 10-year-old tree, which is also the production of an 8-year-old tree in years 5, 6, and 7. 

So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is 1000 fruits. Since the 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, we can set up the equation: x - 200 = 1000. Solving for x, we get x = 1200.

Now that we know the production of an 8-year-old tree, we can find the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life.

Total fruits = 50 + 150 + 350 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 0 + 0 + 1000 = 4500.

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. 

We are given that R = 4B and B = Y - 7. 

We also know that R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting R = 4B into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Substituting B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37, we get 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides to get 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6 to get Y = 12.

Now that we know Y = 12, we can find B by substituting Y into the equation B = Y - 7, which gives B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B = 5, we can find R by substituting B into the equation R = 4B, which gives R = 4 * 5 = 20.

2. After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount given to the little sister 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

3. According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money, which means $15 - x = (4/5) * $15.

4. We can simplify the equation: $15 - x = $12.

"Let's break down the information given:

- There are four colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow.
- There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
- Half the mural is yellow.
- The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is the combination of red, white, and purple paint. Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as x. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the total amount of these three colors is 3x.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow. So, the other half is 6 pints (12 / 2 = 6). This 6 pints is the combination of red, white, and purple paint, which is 3x.

We can set up the equation: 3x = 6

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 6 / 3
x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, and then add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas together: 960 (bedrooms) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 3160 square feet.

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

4. He triples his money, which means he now has 3 times the value of the remaining bills. Since each bill is $20, he now has 20 * 20 * 3 = $1200.

5. Since he has $1200 and each bill is $20, he now has 1200 / 20 = 60 bills.

6. He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now $5, he has 60 / 5 = 12 5-dollar bills.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team in the match:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then divide it by the daily usage.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of it. 

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

So, after Monday, 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk is left.

The teacher then goes back to using 20% of the chalk each day. 

To find out how many days the remaining chalk will last, we need to divide the remaining chalk by the daily usage.

Daily usage = 20% of 5 inches = 0.2 * 5 = 1 inch

Number of days = Remaining chalk / Daily usage

"To find the percentage of teeth the dentist fixes, we first need to determine the total number of teeth the dentist works on. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more than he drills, so the number of teeth capped is 4 + 7 = 11. 

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15.

To find the percentage of teeth the dentist fixes, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100. 

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the amount of milk that was returned, we need to calculate 2/5 of 4000 gallons. 

2/5 * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5
= 8000 / 5
= 1600 gallons

Since the cost per gallon is $3.5, the total refund will be the cost of 1600 gallons of milk.

Total refund = 1600 * $3.5
= $5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

20 = C

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many books Bob can buy in total, we need to divide the total amount of money he has ($27000) by the cost of 100 books ($500). 

Total books = Total money / Cost per 100 books
Total books = $27000 / $500
Total books = 54

Since Bob is distributing the money to 3 schools, we need to divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school.

Books per school = Total books / Number of schools
Books per school = 54 / 3
Books per school = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the sequence of events:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up 2 apples, put 1 in his pocket, and threw 1 back into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples.
3. He picked up the 5 new apples and put all but 1 in his pocket. So, he now has 1 apple in his pocket and 1 new apple.
4. He threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 6 new apples.

To find the total number of apples he brought home, we add the apples in his pocket and the new apples: 1 (in pocket) + 6 (new apples) = 7 apples.

"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is needed for, and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

For cheese pizza, Kate's 6 friends each eat 6 slices, so the total number of cheese pizza slices needed is 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices. 

For pepperoni pizza, Kate's 6 friends each eat 4 slices, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices needed is 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices.

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find the total number of whole pizzas needed for each type. 

For cheese pizza, 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas. 

For pepperoni pizza, 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, she needs a total of 3 + 3 = 6 pizzas. 

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total miles Sam ran, we need to add the miles he ran on each day. 

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So, the total miles he ran on these days is 3 * 3 = 9 miles.

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So, the total miles he ran on these days is 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many snowballs Jay builds per minute and how many melt per minute, and then calculate the net change in the number of snowballs per minute.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 60 minutes, so he builds 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so they melt 2/15 snowballs per minute.

The net change in the number of snowballs per minute is (1/3) - (2/15) = (5/15) - (2/15) = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay starts with 0 snowballs, we need to find out how many minutes it will take to build 60 snowballs. 

Let's set up an equation: 

0 + (1/5)t = 60

To solve for t, we multiply both sides by 5: 
0 + t = 60 * 5
t = 300

So, it will take Jay 300 minutes to build 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find Jim's age, we need to first find John's age 20 years ago. Since John is 28 now, 20 years ago he was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, Jim's age 20 years ago was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

To find Jim's current age, we add 20 years to his age 20 years ago: 4 + 20 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many slices each person ate, let's break it down step by step:

1. Doxa ate 1 slice.
2. Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
3. Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the total number of slices they ate:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the remaining bandages after the first day are x - 38 + 50.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The remaining bandages after the second day are (x - 38 + 50) - 28.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they had 100 bandages added. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The remaining bandages after the third day are ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) + 100 - 25.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78

Simplifying the equation:

x - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78
x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides:

x = 21

"To find Jen's total earnings, we need to calculate her regular pay and her attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:
Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, she works a total of 4 weeks * 6 days/week = 24 days.
Her total hours worked in April is 7.5 hours/day * 24 days = 180 hours.
Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her total regular pay is 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270.

Next, let's calculate her attendance bonus:
Jen receives an additional $10 for complete attendance, and since she did not incur any absences for the entire month, she is eligible for the bonus for all 4 weeks.
Her total attendance bonus is $10/week * 4 weeks = $40.

Now, let's add her regular pay and attendance bonus to find her total earnings:
Total earnings = $270 (regular pay) + $40 (attendance bonus) = $310.

"To find the total cost, we first need to find the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. So, the cost per bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of cognac per bottle is 50% more than the cost of scotch per bottle. 50% of $60 is $30, so the cost of cognac per bottle is $60 + $30 = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Let x be the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The problem states that ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8.

We are told that this expression is equal to 40, so we can set up the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the total amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the total interest he owes and add it to the initial amount borrowed.

First, let's calculate the total interest Stephen owes. He promised to pay 2% of the initial amount of $300. 

Interest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6

Now, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will pay in the first 11 months. He will pay $25 per month for 11 months.

Total paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275

Now, let's calculate the remaining amount Stephen owes after 11 months. This will be the initial amount borrowed plus the interest minus the total amount paid in 11 months.

Remaining amount = Initial amount + Interest - Total paid in 11 months
= $300 + $6 - $275
= $31

However, this remaining amount is not the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month. The problem states that Stephen will pay the remaining amount, including the interest, in the twelfth month. This means we need to add the interest to the remaining amount.

Total amount to be paid in the twelfth month = Remaining amount + Interest

"To find the total volume of the jar, we need to multiply the length, width, and height of the jar. 

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume used by the jelly beans will be 80% of the total volume.

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of one jelly bean.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between his guess and the true number of red jelly beans.

"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for the first 5 years and the cost of visits for the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5. The annual cost is 3 * $5 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

The total cost for all visits is $30 + $45 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups and the total time required for all students to participate.

There are 4 grades (4-7) with 10 students in each grade, so the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find the total number of groups: 40 / 8 = 5.

Each group uses 45 minutes to try and escape, so the total time required for all students to participate is the number of groups multiplied by the time per group: 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the tables and the total cost of the roof frames, and then add them together.

The cost of the tables is 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.
The cost of the roof frames is 2 frames * $10 per frame = $20.

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames together: $80 + $20 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To find the length of the longer piece, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length is 4x.

The total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet, we can find the length of the longer piece by multiplying x by 4:

4x = 4 * 8 = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can multiply the total pounds of meat needed by the amount of seasoning per pound to find the total seasoning needed.

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the width of one window by the number of windows. 

Width of one window: 35 inches

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. 
   Let's denote the number of cupcakes as C and the number of brownies as B. 
   We can write this as B = 3C - 2.

2. Each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. 
   The total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

3. The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies. 
   We can write this as C + B = 10.

4. Substitute the expression for B from step 1 into the equation in step 3. 
   C + (3C - 2) = 10

5. Combine like terms. 
   4C - 2 = 10

The discount on the manicure is 20% of $35, which is 0.2 * 35 = $7. 
The discount on the pedicure is 20% of $40, which is 0.2 * 40 = $8.

The total discount is $7 + $8 = $15.

The cost of the manicure after the discount is $35 - $7 = $28.
The cost of the pedicure after the discount is $40 - $8 = $32.

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure is $28 + $32 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers, the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art is $60 + $30 = $90.

   Price in December = $72
   Decrease percentage = 50%
   Price decrease = 72 * 0.5 = $36
   New price in January = 72 - 36 = $36

The final price of the toy after the discount in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the standard lessons and the veteran lessons separately, and then add them together.

For the standard lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour, so the total amount he earns from these lessons is:
4 * $80 = $320

For the veteran lessons, Charlie reduces his rate by 25%, so his new rate is:
$80 - (25% of $80) = $80 - $20 = $60

He has 2 lessons at this rate, so the total amount he earns from the veteran lessons is:
2 * $60 = $120

Now, we add the amounts earned from the standard lessons and the veteran lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make:
$320 + $120 = $440

210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The sum of the scores is 630.

"To find the number of apples Walter ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60. 

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 apples

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining.

60 - 24 = 36 apples

Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. To find 25% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.25.

0.25 * 36 = 9 apples

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining.

36 - 9 = 27 apples

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total amount of money he received, we multiply 27 by 3.

Let's start by setting up the equation:

9 novels = 3/4 * x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4/3:

x = 9 * 4/3
x = 12

So, Regina wrote 12 novels this year."
"To find the distance covered by Michael in 3 days, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in 3 days at an average speed of 50 km/hr.

First, we need to convert the time from days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3 days is equal to 3 x 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total distance traveled by multiplying the average speed by the total time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 50 km/hr x 72 hr
Distance = 3600 km

Now, we can find the percentage of the distance covered by dividing the distance traveled by the total distance between Alaska and Texas and multiplying by 100:

Percentage = (Distance traveled / Total distance) x 100
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) x 100
Percentage = 0.6 x 100
Percentage = 60%

"To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to determine how many grapes were used by Madeline's brother and her mother, and then add the initial number of grapes Madeline ate.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, she used 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline's brother and her mother is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

Since Madeline ate 6 grapes initially, the total number of grapes at the beginning is 84 + 6 = 90 grapes.

"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to determine the capacity of each shelf. 

The middle shelves can hold 10 books each. 
The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.
The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase. 
Two middle shelves can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.
The bottom shelf can hold 20 books.
The top shelf can hold 15 books.
So, the total capacity of one bookcase is 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase to find out how many bookcases she needs.

60% of 70 = 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions correct.

Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct to pass, we need to find the total number of questions she needs to get right. 
Let's assume the total number of questions is x. 
70% of x = 0.7x

We know that the total number of questions is the sum of the questions in both tests: 70 + 40 = 110 questions.

So, 0.7x = 110
x = 110 / 0.7
x = 157.14 (round down to 157 since you can't get a fraction of a question)

Now that we know the total number of questions, we can find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test. 
She already got 42 questions right on the first test. 
So, she needs to get 70% of 157 - 42 = 110.3 - 42 = 68.3 questions right on the second test.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for each item and then multiply it by the number of weeks.

Cost per blouse: $5.00
Number of blouses: 5
Cost for blouses per week: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Cost per skirt: $6.00
Number of skirts: 1
Cost for skirts per week: 1 * $6.00 = $6.00

Cost per pair of pants: $8.00
Number of pants: 2
Cost for pants per week: 2 * $8.00 = $16.00

Total cost per week: $25.00 + $6.00 + $16.00 = $47.00

Total cost for 5 weeks: $47.00 * 5 = $235.00

The final answer is: $235.00"
"To find the new speaking speed, we need to multiply John's original speed by 2.5. 

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can convert the new speed to words per second by dividing by 60.

New speed (words per second) = 375 WPM / 60 = 6.25 words per second

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. 

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words per page = 4500 words

To find the time it takes to speak 4500 words, we can divide the total number of words by the new speed in words per second.

Time = Total words / New speed (words per second) = 4500 words / 6.25 words per second = 720 seconds

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we can convert the time to minutes by dividing by 60.

Time (minutes) = 720 seconds / 60 = 12 minutes

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining days.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.
On the second day, Conor saw 20 more people than on the first day, so he saw 50 + 20 = 70 people.
On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so he saw 2 * 70 = 140 people.

The total number of people Conor saw on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 1.5 minutes is 20 + 60 = 80.
4. In the next 30 seconds, the kernels pop at four times the initial rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.
5. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 2 minutes is 80 + 80 = 160.
6. In the final 30 seconds, the kernels pop at half the rate of the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.
7. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 2.5 minutes is 160 + 40 = 200.
8. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. This is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.
9. So, the total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210.

"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade he needs to make, including the extra gallon for Allen. 

Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party, and an extra gallon for Allen, so the total amount of lemonade is 4 + 1 = 5 gallons.

Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, and 5 gallons require 5 cups of lemon juice, we need to find out how many lemons are needed to get 5 cups of juice.

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can set up a proportion to find out how many lemons are needed for 5 cups of juice:

6 lemons / 1 cup = x lemons / 5 cups

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

6 * 5 = x * 1
30 = x

So, Tim needs 30 lemons in total.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount of dog food needed per day, we need to calculate the total consumption of the German Shepherds and the Bulldogs separately and then add them together.

The 3 German Shepherds consume 3 * 5 = 15 kilograms of dog food per day.
The 2 Bulldogs consume 2 * 3 = 6 kilograms of dog food per day.

The total consumption per day is 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms.

To find the total consumption per week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week).
21 * 7 = 147 kilograms.

For the 2-legged animals: 10 animals * 2 legs per animal = 20 legs
For the 4-legged animals: 15 animals * 4 legs per animal = 60 legs

Now, add the total number of legs from both types of animals: 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

Since the question asks for pairs of animal legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2: 80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs of legs

"To find the number of red blocks, we first need to determine the total number of blue and yellow blocks. 

There are 4 blue blocks. Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12.

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, the number of red blocks can be found by subtracting the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 32 - 12 = 20.

"To find the distance Elvis traveled west, we multiply the speed by the time: 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles. 

To find the distance Elvis traveled east, we multiply the speed by the time: 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the difference between the two distances to determine how far he is from his house now. 

The distance traveled west is 90 miles, and the distance traveled east is 144 miles. The difference is 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

Initial value of the boat = $9000

Depreciation in the first year = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Depreciation in the second year = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Depreciation in the third year = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after the third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to find the number of orange and yellow candies. 

The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so it is 2 * 54 = 108.

"To find out how much feed is left, we first need to calculate how much feed the pigs eat in a day and then multiply it by 7 to find out how much they eat in a week.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so each pig eats 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of feed per day.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total amount of feed they eat per day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

In a week, the pigs eat 40 * 7 = 280 pounds of feed.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so to find out how much is left, we subtract the amount eaten from the total amount ordered: 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
- Igor gathered two more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested: 14 + 2 = 16 test tubes, which matches the half of the test tubes he gathered, so this information is consistent.
- Igor gathered the correct number of beakers: 7 beakers.
- The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29.

Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as 'x'. The total number of items Igor had is the sum of the test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes, minus the beakers he lost: 8 + 7 - x + 14 = 29.

Combine like terms: 29 = 29 - x.

To find 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Since 29 is equal to 29 - x, we can add 'x' to both sides of the equation to get: 29 + x = 29.

Subtract 29 from both sides: x = 0.

The final answer is: 0"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to calculate the number of eggs in the second basket and then add it to the number of eggs in the first basket.

Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as in the first basket, and the first basket has 10 eggs, the second basket has 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 (first basket) + 20 (second basket) = 30 eggs.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount raised by each girl and add them together.

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430. So, Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. So, Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we add the amounts raised by each girl: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron.
2. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
3. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if Vanessa runs 4 miles, Aaron would run half the distance, which is 2 miles.

Since Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and he ran 2 miles, we can find his speed. Speed = Distance / Time = 2 miles / 16 minutes = 1/8 miles per minute.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's speed, which is 1/16 miles per minute.

Now, we can find the time it took Vanessa to complete her part of the race. Time = Distance / Speed = 4 miles / (1/16 miles per minute) = 4 * 16 = 64 minutes.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line

Since he already has 6 feet of new line, we need to subtract that from the total amount of line required.

600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate their daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

Daily revenue = (2 meals * $5 per meal) + $5 bottle of wine
Daily revenue = (2 * $5) + $5
Daily revenue = $10 + $5
Daily revenue = $15

Since they are open 2 days a week, we multiply the daily revenue by 2:
Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * 2
Weekly revenue = $15 * 2
Weekly revenue = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"To find the cost of each watermelon, we first need to find the total selling price of all the watermelons. 

The profit percentage is 25%, which means the selling price is 125% of the cost price (100% + 25% profit). 

The cost price of 50 watermelons is $80. 

Let's calculate the total selling price: 
Total selling price = Cost price + Profit
Total selling price = $80 + (25% of $80)
Total selling price = $80 + (0.25 * $80)
Total selling price = $80 + $20
Total selling price = $100

Now, we know the total selling price of 50 watermelons is $100. To find the selling price of each watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50
Selling price per watermelon = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the current age of James, we need to first find Dora's current age. Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

James is 9 years older than John, so John's current age is 18 - 9 = 9 years. However, we are given that John was 19 when James was born, so we need to find the age difference between John and James at that time. The age difference between John and James is 19 - 9 = 10 years.

Now, we need to find the age difference between John and his youngest son. John was 32 when his youngest son was born, so the age difference between John and his youngest son is 32 years.

Since John is currently 9 years old, in 3 years, he will be 9 + 3 = 12 years old.

The age difference between John and his youngest son is 32 years, so in 3 years, the age difference will be 32 years. To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we add 3 years to his current age. However, we don't know his current age. 

To find his current age, we need to find John's age when his youngest son was born. We already know John's current age is 9 years. We are given that John was 19 when James was born, and James is 9 years older than John. However, we are given that John was 32 when his youngest son was born. 

The age difference between John and James is 10 years, and the age difference between John and his youngest son is 32 - 10 = 22 years. 

Since James is 9 years older than John, and the age difference between John and his youngest son is 22 years, the age difference between James and John's youngest son is 22 - 9 = 13 years.

Since James is 18 years old, his youngest brother is 18 - 13 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each of them can peel in an hour and then find the difference.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total cost, first, calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. 

Original cost of the radiator: $400
Discount: 80%
Discount amount: 400 * 0.8 = $320
Cost of the radiator after the discount: 400 - 320 = $80

Next, calculate the labor cost for the mechanic.

Labor hours: 3 hours
Labor rate: $50 per hour
Labor cost: 3 * 50 = $150

Now, add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total cost.

Total cost: 80 + 150 = $230

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so C + W = 20.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. Therefore, we can write the equation: 2C + 4W = 70.

We can solve the first equation for W: W = 20 - C.

Now, substitute W in the second equation: 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.

Expand the equation: 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.

Combine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.

Divide both sides by -2: C = 5.

The number of chickens is 5."
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, let's find the total number of slices: 7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices.

Now, let's divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person.

The final answer is: 14"
