"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

Now, let's subtract the eggs she used from the total number of eggs she laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. To find out how much she makes, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg: 9 * 2 = 18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we need 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the blue and white fiber bolts together: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we need to first find the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

Let's find the value of the repairs in terms of the original value of the house. If the original value is 100%, then the increase is 150%. So, the total value after repairs is 100% + 150% = 250% of the original value.

Since 250% is the same as 2.5 times the original value, we can multiply the original value by 2.5 to find the new value:

$80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000

Now, we know the total value of the house after the repairs is $200,000. To find the profit, we need to subtract the original cost of the house and the repairs from the new value:

Profit = New value - (Original cost + Repairs)
Profit = $200,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000)
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total meters he runs in one session is 3 * 60 = 180 meters.

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is 180 * 3 = 540 meters.

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals. 

In the morning, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens 25 cups of feed. 

Total cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon = 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed needed per meal is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total cups of feed needed per meal.

Cups of feed needed in the final meal = Total cups of feed needed per meal - Total cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon
= 60 - 40
= 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
We can see that the cost of each glass decreases by 40% (1 - 0.6) of the previous glass's price. 

The cost of the first glass is $5, the second is $3, the third is $1.8, the fourth is $1.8 * 0.6 = $1.08, the fifth is $1.08 * 0.6 = $0.648, the sixth is $0.648 * 0.6 = $0.3888, the seventh is $0.3888 * 0.6 = $0.23328, the eighth is $0.23328 * 0.6 = $0.139968, the ninth is $0.139968 * 0.6 = $0.083981, the tenth is $0.083981 * 0.6 = $0.050388, the eleventh is $0.050388 * 0.6 = $0.030233, the twelfth is $0.030233 * 0.6 = $0.018139, the thirteenth is $0.018139 * 0.6 = $0.010883, the fourteenth is $0.010883 * 0.6 = $0.006529, the fifteenth is $0.006529 * 0.6 = $0.003916, the sixteenth is $0.003916 * 0.6 = $0.002359.

Now, we can add up the costs of all the glasses: 
$5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.648 + $0.3888 + $0.23328 + $0.139968 + $0.083981 + $0.050388 + $0.030233 + $0.018139 + $0.010883 + $0.006529 + $0.003916 + $0.002359 = $17.783.

However, Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, but we have only calculated the cost of 15 glasses. The cost of the 16th glass is $0.002359. 

The total cost is $17.783 + $0.002359 = $17.785359.

The final answer is: $17.79"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   Since Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

2. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   Since Charleston has 80 sheep, Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add up the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
Toulouse has 160 sheep, Charleston has 80 sheep, and Seattle has 20 sheep.
Total sheep = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, add the time it takes to install the updates, and then add the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, let's find the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 x 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Next, we add the time it takes to install the updates, which is 20 minutes.

Now, we need to find the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. 60% of 200 GB is 0.6 x 200 = 120 GB. The time it takes to download 120 GB is 120 / 2 = 60 minutes.

Finally, we add the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file: 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled in the first 3 hours and the distance he traveled in the last 4 hours.

First, let's calculate the distance John traveled in the first 3 hours:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 mph * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

Since John turns around, he is now 180 miles away from home.

Now, let's calculate the distance John traveled in the last 4 hours:

John spent the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he didn't travel any distance during this time. 

He then spent the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 mph * 0.5 hours
Distance = 15 miles

He then spent the remaining 2 hours driving at a speed of 80 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 160 miles

The total distance John traveled in the last 4 hours is 15 + 160 = 175 miles.

Since John was 180 miles away from home initially, and he traveled 175 miles in the last 4 hours, he is now 180 - 175 = 5 miles away from home.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime pay rate is:
$10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

Her earnings for the overtime hours are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings for the week are:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads from each month together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total revenue it generates each year.

The initial cost of the tree is $90. 

Each year, the tree generates revenue from selling lemons. Since the tree grows 7 lemons per year and each lemon sells for $1.5, the total revenue per year is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

However, it also costs $3 to water and feed the tree each year. So, the net revenue per year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

To find out how many years it will take for the tree to start earning money, we need to find the break-even point, which is when the total revenue equals the initial cost of the tree. 

Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. The total revenue after 'x' years is $7.5x, and the total cost is $90. We set up the equation:

$7.5x = $90

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides by $7.5:

x = $90 / $7.5
x = 12

Since the tree will start earning money after the 13th year (when the total revenue exceeds the initial cost), it will take 13 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final answer is: 13"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.
2. She sold 2 more at the red house.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house.
4. She has 5 vacuum cleaners left.

Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as x.

From point 1, Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she has (2/3)x left after the green house sale.

From point 2, she sold 2 more at the red house, so she has (2/3)x - 2 left after the red house sale.

From point 3, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she has ((2/3)x - 2)/2 left after the orange house sale.

From point 4, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

((2/3)x - 2)/2 = 5

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get:

(2/3)x - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

(2/3)x = 12

Multiply both sides by 3/2 to solve for x:

x = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students

The remaining students after contemporary dance are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

The remaining students after jazz dance are 16 - 4 = 12 students.

Since the rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 12.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To maximize profit, the merchant should choose the item that will increase in value the most. 

First, let's calculate the increase in value for each item:

Jewelry: 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125
Electronic gadgets: 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96

Since $125 is greater than $96, the merchant should choose the jewelry. 

The profit will be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. 

On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance.

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
She works 35 hours a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total hours she works as a teacher in a year is 35 * 50 = 1750 hours.
Her hourly wage as a teacher is $20, so her total earnings from teaching in a year is 1750 * $20 = $35,000.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
She works 15 hours a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total hours she works as a coach in a year is 15 * 50 = 750 hours.
Her hourly wage as a coach is $30, so her total earnings from coaching in a year is 750 * $30 = $22,500.

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her annual salary:
$35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in 4 weeks and then multiply it by the number of eggs she eats per day.

There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will have 4 x 7 = 28 days.

Claire eats 3 eggs per day, so in 28 days, she will eat 28 x 3 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat.

84 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 7 dozens.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total time Marissa wants to take to complete the 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours.

Since Marissa has already taken 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another hour to walk the next 2 miles, she has taken a total of 2 hours so far. 

The remaining time she has to complete the trail is 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour.

The remaining distance is 12 miles - (4 miles + 2 miles) = 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can use the formula: speed = distance / time.

speed = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. 

Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the remaining one-third is non-water. So, the non-water portion is 10 - 6.67 = 3.33 liters.

Now, to find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, we need to calculate three-fifths of 15 liters.

Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Since we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of the orange drink. The remaining amount of the orange drink is 10 - 1 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the remaining amount of the orange drink to the pineapple drink to get the total amount of the mixture. 9 + 15 = 24 liters.

The total amount of water in the orange drink is 6.67 liters, and the total amount of water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters. 

The total amount of water in the mixture is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

However, we need to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture. Since we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, we need to subtract the non-water portion of the spilled drink from the total amount of water. The non-water portion of the spilled drink is 1 * (1/3) = 1/3 = 0.33 liters.

The amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 15.67 - 0.33 = 15.34 liters.

"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought a total of 3 DVDs.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought a total of 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

So, Billy sold 7 DVDs to the first 5 customers. The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so we don't need to add anything to the total.

"To find out how many centimeters shorter the candle will be, we need to calculate the total number of hours it burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours.

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price.

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since Kyle bought the book with a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of the original price, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so we can set up the equation:

x - 0.25x = 19.50

Combine like terms:

0.75x = 19.50

Now, divide both sides by 0.75 to solve for x:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she ordered excluding the pizza. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12. 
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15. 
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6. 

The total cost of the items excluding pizza is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. 

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17. 

Now, we need to find out how many boxes of pizza cost $17. Each box costs $8.50, so the number of boxes is $17 / $8.50 = 2.

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 cartons of ice cream for 60 days (1 serving per night for 60 nights).

Each carton has 15 servings, so to find the total number of cartons she needs, we divide the total number of days by the number of servings per carton:

60 days / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the total number of cartons by the cost per carton:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

So, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 from 60. 

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance of the first stop and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

20 miles (first stop) - 45 miles (distance from second stop to the end) is not correct, we need to find the distance from the first stop to the second stop. 

Since the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, we can find the distance from the first stop to the second stop by subtracting 15 from the distance of the first stop and then subtracting that result from the total trip distance. 

However, a simpler way to find the distance between the two stops is to subtract the distance of the first stop from the total trip distance and then subtract the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip from that result. 

60 miles (total trip) - 20 miles (first stop) = 40 miles
40 miles - 15 miles (distance from second stop to the end) = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

"Let's break down the information given. 

Let the cost of the boots be B. 
One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice as much, so the other pair costs 2 * 33 = $66. 
The total cost of the two pairs of heels is 33 + 66 = $99. 
Since the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots, we can set up the equation: B = 99 + 5. 
Solving for B, we get B = 104.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x, where x is a constant.

Since their total age now is 162, we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages:

Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The third person guesses 25% more than the first one: 80 * 0.25 = 20, then 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 people, so we divide the total by 3 to find the average: 240 / 3 = 80.

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We know that G = S + 30. We also know that the total number of coins is 110, so S + G = 110.

Substituting G = S + 30 into the second equation, we get S + (S + 30) = 110. Simplifying this, we get 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2S = 80. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30. G = 40 + 30 = 70.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 1. Then, we add this to the original 4 points to get the total points scored in the second 20 minutes: 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes to get the total points: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first find out how many yogurts he eats in 30 days. 

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys. 

60 yogurts / 4 yogurts per set = 15 sets.

Now, we multiply the number of sets by the price per set to find the total cost. 

15 sets * $5.00 per set = $75.00

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many Lego sets John has left, we first need to calculate how much money he made from selling the Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = $195.

Then, he bought 8 video games for $20 each, so the total amount of money he spent on video games is 8 * 20 = $160.

After buying the video games, he had $5 left, so the total amount of money he had before buying the video games is 195 + 5 = $200.

Now, we know that he spent $160 on video games, so the amount of money he had before buying the video games is equal to the amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets plus the amount of money he had left. 

Since he made $195 from selling the Lego sets and had $5 left, he must have had $200 before buying the video games.

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his total running time and then divide the total distance by that time.

John runs 3 hours the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

Total hours run per week = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours

Since John runs 60 miles a week and runs for 6 hours a week, we can find his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:

Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out Dana's walking speed first. Since she can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour. 

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours she spends walking and running. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, in 6 hours, she spends 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours running and 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is 6 * 2 = 12 miles, and the distance she travels while walking is 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles.

The total distance she can travel in six hours is 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the information given:

"To find out how far outside of the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to calculate the total distance she can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone.

When Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. To find out how far outside of the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to subtract the dragon's reach from the total distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone.

1200 - 1000 = 200

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside of the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin."
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces. 

First, let's find the total number of pieces. Since Grandma Jones cut each pie into 8 pieces and she baked 5 pies, the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40.

Now, let's subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces to find out how many were taken by the guests. 

40 (total pieces) - 14 (remaining pieces) = 26

So, 26 pieces of pie were taken by the guests."
"To find out how many calories you can still consume, subtract the calories you've already eaten from your daily target. 

2000 (daily target) - 1800 (already consumed) = 200 calories left

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find out how many servings you can eat.

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, multiply the number of servings you can eat by the total weight of the bag to find out how many grams you can eat.

0.8 servings * 300g = 240g

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total cost. Since Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for 10 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks for 20 candles. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is $10.00. 

Next, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles. The total revenue is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Now, let's find the net profit. The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. The total cost is $10.00, and the total revenue is $40.00. 

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $10.00
Net profit = $30.00

The final answer is: $30.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since it takes 4 hours to write one article, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

The final answer is: 104"
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to first determine how many Post-it notes she used in total. 

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work. To find the total number of Post-it notes she used, we add 80 and 220: 80 + 220 = 300. 

Since she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, we need to subtract 23 from the total number of Post-it notes she used to find out how many she purchased: 300 - 23 = 277.

The final answer is: 277"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find the number of blue ties, we divide the total amount spent by the cost per tie: 200 / 40 = 5 blue ties.

2. Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he buys 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

3. The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. This means the cost of a red tie is 1.5 times the cost of a blue tie. So, the cost of a red tie is 1.5 * 40 = $60.

4. To find the total amount spent on red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost per red tie: 10 * 60 = $600.

5. To find the total amount spent on ties, we add the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties: 200 + 600 = $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches, since the pieces are 6 inches long. 

1 foot is equal to 12 inches. 

So, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we need to divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches) to find out how many pieces Tracy obtained.

48 / 6 = 8

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of units in the building, we multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor: 15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units. To do this, we multiply the total number of units by 1/4: 120 units * 1/4 = 30 units.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs are produced per week: 
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens are produced per week:
1764 eggs per week / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the total time Tom spent traveling, we need to calculate the time he spent going and coming back. 

First, let's find the time he spent going from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels from 1 to 4 PM, that's a 3-hour period. However, we need to find the distance he traveled and then divide it by his speed to get the time. 

The distance from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours * 10 miles per hour = 30 miles.

Now, let's find the time it took him to travel 30 miles at 10 miles per hour. Time = Distance / Speed = 30 miles / 10 mph = 3 hours.

Since he traveled from 1 to 4 PM, which is 3 hours, and it took him 3 hours to travel that distance, he must have started at 10 AM. 

Now, let's find the time he spent going back. The distance is the same, 30 miles, and his speed is 6 mph. Time = Distance / Speed = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.

So, the total time he spent going back is 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the total weight of the comic books he removed. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removed 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books already removed weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, to find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the revenue earned on Thursday, we need to calculate the total revenue from truck tires and car tires separately and then add them together. 

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday: 6 truck tires * $60 per tire = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday: 4 car tires * $40 per tire = $160
Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Revenue from car tires on Friday: 12 car tires * $40 per tire = $480

Since the revenue from car tires on Friday ($480) is higher than the revenue from both truck and car tires on Thursday ($520), we need to compare the revenue from car tires on Friday with the total revenue on Thursday.

To find the difference, we subtract the revenue from car tires on Friday from the total revenue on Thursday: $520 - $480 = $40

"To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately and then add them together.

The first half of the year is 6 months, and the second half of the year is also 6 months. 

The initial amount charged per month is $140. 

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the company charged her 10% less than the initial amount. 
10% of $140 is 0.1 * $140 = $14. 
So, the amount charged for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126 per month.
For the second half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $126 = $756.

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $756 = $1596.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to determine the car's miles per gallon (mpg) rating. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled since the last fill-up (100 miles) by the amount of gas used (4 gallons).

mpg = distance / gas used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the car's mpg rating, we can find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity (12 gallons) by the mpg rating.

total miles = tank capacity * mpg
total miles = 12 gallons * 25 miles/gallon
total miles = 300 miles

"Let's break down the problem. Bailey starts with an unknown amount of money, let's call it x. She receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so she receives a total of 5 * 8 = $40. At the end of the 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. 

We can set up an equation to represent this situation: x + 40 = 100. To find the initial amount of money Bailey had, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation: x = 100 - 40.

x = 60

So, Bailey started with $60."
"To find out how much Judy makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches and the total amount of money she earns from each class.

Judy teaches 5 classes per day on weekdays, which is 5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes. 
She also teaches 8 classes on Saturday, so the total number of classes in a week is 25 classes + 8 classes = 33 classes.

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students per class is 15 students/class. 
The total number of students in a week is 33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students.

Judy charges $15.00 per student, so the total amount of money she earns in a week is 495 students * $15.00/student = $7,425.00.

"To find the total amount Shiela will pay each month, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then divide it by the number of months.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 * $150 = $750.

Since a 2% interest will be charged for each unit, the interest for each cell phone is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3.

The total interest for all 5 cell phones is 5 * $3 = $15.

The total amount Shiela will pay for the cell phones is $750 + $15 = $765.

Since the payment is for 3 months, we need to divide the total amount by 3 to find the monthly payment.

$765 / 3 = $255.

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days. So, the total amount of dog food eaten in the first 180 days is 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.

The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the total amount of dog food eaten in the rest of the year is 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food eaten in the first year is 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package. 

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 
18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages of 2 flowers.
9 packages * $1 per package = $9.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the higher price.

Initial salary: $600
Increase after 5 years: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 5 years: $600 + $60 = $660

Now, we need to calculate the increase for the next three years:
Increase after 6 years: 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 6 years: $660 + $66 = $726
Increase after 7 years: 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 7 years: $726 + $72.60 = $798.60
Increase after 8 years: 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 8 years: $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

16 (invited guests) - (1/4 * 16) = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of guests who will attend by 0.75.

12 (guests) * 0.75 (gift bags per guest) = 9

Now, we need to find the total cost of the gift bags. Each gift bag costs $2, so we multiply the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag.

So, 98 - 40 = 58.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and add them up.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, which is 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.
The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, and since the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.
The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings: 
20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we need to add up the pages from all his textbooks. 

4 pages (Science) + 20 pages (Social Studies) + 7 pages (History) + 8 pages (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we need to subtract those from the total to find out how many pages are left to read.

39 pages - 15 pages = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average per day, we need to divide the remaining pages by the number of days.

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

"Let's break down John's water consumption. 

On weekdays, John has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one before bed. That's 4 glasses of water per day. Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John has a glass of water with breakfast and lunch, and a soda with dinner. So, he has 2 glasses of water on each weekend day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 2 * 2 = 4 glasses of water on weekends.

In total, John drinks 20 + 4 = 24 glasses of water in a week. 

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

First, we need to find out how many 3-mile sections are in 42 miles. We can do this by dividing 42 by 3.

42 miles / 3 miles per section = 14 sections

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile section, we multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section.

14 sections * 10 minutes per section = 140 minutes

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how many pieces Poppy placed, we need to calculate a quarter of 1000. 

A quarter of 1000 is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after Poppy placed 250. 

1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left.

Then, her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. 

A third of 750 is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after her mom placed 250. 

750 - 250 = 500 pieces left.

The final answer is: 500"
"To find out how many cookies Cody eats, we need to multiply the number of cookies Amir eats by 3. 

Amir eats 5 cookies, so Cody eats 5 * 3 = 15 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies they eat together, we need to add the number of cookies Amir eats and the number of cookies Cody eats.

Total cookies = Amir's cookies + Cody's cookies
Total cookies = 5 + 15
Total cookies = 20

"To find the inner volume of one box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the dimensions of the box. 

The length and width of the inner box will be 5 - 2 = 3 inches (since there are walls on both sides) and 6 - 2 = 4 inches. The height of the inner box will be 4 - 2 = 2 inches.

The inner volume of one box is 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 3 * 24 = 72 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Monday and Tuesday: 2 nights * 1 hour per night = 2 hours
- Wednesday: We don't know the number of episodes, but each episode is 30 minutes, so let's call the number of episodes x. The total time watched on Wednesday is 30x minutes.
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes) = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 * 1 hour = 2 hours

The total time watched is 2 + 30x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 hours. We can set up the equation:

2 + 30x + 1.5 + 2 = 7

Combine like terms:

5.5 + 30x = 7

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

30x = 1.5

Divide both sides by 30:

x = 0.05

Since x represents the number of episodes, and each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert x to hours to find the total time watched on Wednesday. However, the question asks for the number of 30-minute episodes, so we can leave x as is.

The number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday is 0.05."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year.
2. This year, he wants to make twice as many as he did last year, so he bakes 2x cookies.
3. However, he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.
4. After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.
5. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110.
6. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 2x = 100.
7. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 50.

"To find the total cost of the gas, we need to multiply the price per gallon by the number of gallons. 

Total cost of gas = Price per gallon * Number of gallons
Total cost of gas = $3.00 * 10
Total cost of gas = $30.00

Next, we need to calculate the cashback rewards. 

Cashback rewards = Cashback per gallon * Number of gallons
Cashback rewards = $0.20 * 10
Cashback rewards = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cashback rewards from the total cost of gas to find the final cost.

Final cost = Total cost of gas - Cashback rewards
Final cost = $30.00 - $2.00
Final cost = $28.00

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups each person ate, we need to multiply the width by the length of each roll-up.

Beatrice's roll-up: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 roll-ups long = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-up: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 roll-ups long = 42 roll-ups

Now, we need to find the total number of roll-ups they ate. 
Total roll-ups = Beatrice's roll-ups + Marcell's roll-ups = 48 + 42 = 90

To find the average number of roll-ups they ate, we need to divide the total number of roll-ups by 2 (since there are 2 people).
Average roll-ups = Total roll-ups / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to first find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rows in 64 seconds. 

Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find out how many seconds it takes her to row 10 feet by dividing 16 by 2. This is 16 / 2 = 8 seconds. 

Now, we can find out how many sets of 10 feet she rows in 64 seconds by dividing 64 by 8. This is 64 / 8 = 8 sets of 10 feet.

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, and Julia rows 8 sets of 10 feet, the boat takes on 8 * 2 = 16 liters of water.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

From point 1, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

From point 2, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This means that the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 300 / 50 = 6.

"To find the total cost of the lumber, we need to calculate the cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards and the 4 x 4 x 10 boards.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 each = $100.
The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 each = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. 

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each.
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 each = $150.
The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 each = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles was 2 * 5 = 10.

On the second day, more containers were brought in, and the total number of vehicles became 30. To find the number of new containers, we need to subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles.

New containers = Total vehicles - Initial vehicles
New containers = 30 - 10
New containers = 20

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of new containers by dividing the total number of new vehicles by 5.

Number of new containers = New vehicles / 5
Number of new containers = 20 / 5
Number of new containers = 4

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. If we let Lylah's salary be x, then Adrien's salary is 1.3x.

We are also given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000. Since his salary increased by 40% over four years, we can set up the equation:

1.4(40000) = 1.3x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 40000 / 1.3
x = 30769.23

So Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30769.23.

Now, we need to find their salaries four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40% from $40000, so his new salary is:

40000 * 1.4 = 56000

Lylah's salary increased by 40% from $30769.23, so her new salary is:

30769.23 * 1.4 = 43056.5222

The total salary of the two four years later is:

56000 + 43056.5222 = 99056.5222

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

The rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday) she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

There are 5 days in the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), so she slept 7 hours each day for 5 days, which is 7 * 5 = 35 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept in the first two days (Monday to Wednesday): 8 + 6 + 6 = 20 hours.

The total hours she slept throughout the week is the sum of the hours she slept in the first two days and the hours she slept in the rest of the week: 20 + 35 = 55 hours.

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours:
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Now, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distances Rosie runs at both speeds:
Total distance = Distance at 10 miles per hour + Distance at 5 miles per hour
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Jennie starts with a pile of 60 letters needing stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of them, which means she stamps 60 / 3 = 20 letters. 

After stamping 20 letters, she has 60 - 20 = 40 letters left that still need stamps. 

We are told that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that the 20 letters she stamped were added to the pile of already-stamped letters. 

So, to find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to subtract the 20 letters she added from the current number of letters in the pile.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total amount charged to patients, then subtract the cost from the revenue.

First, let's find the total time spent by doctors. The hospital sees 500 people a day, and each patient is seen for 24 minutes. 

Total time spent by doctors = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Total time spent by doctors = 12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The doctors charge $150 an hour, so the total cost is:

Total cost = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

Now, let's find the total amount charged to patients. The hospital charges $200 an hour, and the total time spent is 200 hours.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of babies as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

From the third point, we know that B = 2Q.

From the second point, we know that W = 2B.

Substituting the value of B from the first equation into the second equation, we get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting the values of B and W in terms of Q, we get 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700.

Combining like terms, we get 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Now that we know Q, we can find B by substituting Q into the equation B = 2Q, which gives B = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find W by substituting B into the equation W = 2B, which gives W = 2(200) = 400.

The final answer is: 400"
"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week, we need to calculate how many hours he would work in a week and then multiply that by his hourly wage.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day, if he spent that time working instead, he would work 2 hours a day.

There are 7 days in a week, so he would work 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week.

His hourly wage is $10, so his weekly earnings would be 14 hours/week * $10/hour = $140/week.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of food items and non-food items separately and then add them together.

Food items: 
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
Total cost of food items: 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
Total cost of non-food items: 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
Tax = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of non-food items:
Total cost of non-food items with tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax:
Total cost = 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

The final answer is: 16"
"I think there's been a mistake in the question. It says ""Kim"" has started the business, but then it refers to ""Lucas"" in the last sentence. I'll assume it's meant to be ""Kim"" throughout.

To calculate the profit, we need to find the total income and total expenses. 

First, let's find the total income. Kim has 3 current clients and 5 potential clients, making a total of 8 clients. Each client will need 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths, so the total number of bottles of bleach needed is 8 * 2 = 16, and the total number of packs of cloths needed is 8 * 1 = 8.

The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle, so the total cost of bleach is 16 * $2 = $32. The cost of cloths is $5 per pack, so the total cost of cloths is 8 * $5 = $40.

The total expenses are the sum of the cost of bleach and the cost of cloths, which is $32 + $40 = $72.

The total income is given as $92. 

The profit is the difference between the total income and the total expenses, which is $92 - $72 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to first find out how many pineapples he has in total. 

John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field and there are 100 pineapples per hectare. So, the total number of pineapples John has is 10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples.

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods are in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we divide 12 by 3 to get 4. This means John can harvest his pineapples 4 times a year.

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples John has by the number of times he can harvest them in a year. 1000 pineapples * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples.

The final answer is: 4000"
"To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each set and add them together.

The first set has 500 pieces.
The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, so it has 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each set together:
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

The final answer is: 2125"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left return, which is 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees.
3. So, after 12 hours, there are 30 - 15 = 15 bees that haven't returned yet.
4. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 leave the hive, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
5. Now, we have a total of 15 (initial bees that left and haven't returned) + 60 (new bees that left) = 75 bees that haven't returned yet.
6. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before that (15) return to the hive.

So, the number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 15.

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and add the change she received.

The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12 and the cost of 1 child ticket is $10. 

Total cost = cost of adult ticket + cost of child ticket
Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we need to add this to the total cost to find out how much she gave the cashier.

Total given = Total cost + Change
Total given = $22 + $8
Total given = $30

"To find out who wins the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance to feet for both Steve and Tim since their speeds are given in feet per minute. 

Steve's distance is 3 miles, and 1 mile is 5280 feet. So, Steve's distance is 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet.

Tim's distance is 2 miles, and 1 mile is 5280 feet. So, Tim's distance is 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for Steve to get home. Steve's speed is 440 feet per minute, and his distance is 15840 feet. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15840 / 440
Time = 36 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for Tim to get home. Tim's speed is 264 feet per minute, and his distance is 10560 feet.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 10560 / 264
Time = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes to get home and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve wins the race. 

To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to find the difference in their times.

Difference = Time taken by Tim - Time taken by Steve
Difference = 40 - 36
Difference = 4 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find out how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires. 

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and there were 5 bicycles. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * 25 cents = $2.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and there were 3 tricycles. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * 25 cents = $2.25.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and there was 1 unicycle. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1. The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * 25 cents = $0.25.

Now, let's add up the total cost of inflating all the tires: $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total number of fries eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
   Now, the total number of fries eaten by Dave, the seagull, and the pigeons is 21 + 9 = 30.
4. A raccoon ate two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's call the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it 'x'. 
   After the pigeons ate, the remaining fries are x - 30. 
   The raccoon ate two-thirds of this, which is (2/3) * (x - 30).
   The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (x - 30) - (2/3) * (x - 30).
   Simplifying this, we get (1/3) * (x - 30).
5. After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. 
   So, the remaining fries after the raccoon ate are 5.
   Setting this equal to (1/3) * (x - 30), we get:
   (1/3) * (x - 30) = 5
   Multiplying both sides by 3, we get:
   x - 30 = 15
   Adding 30 to both sides, we get:
   x = 45

"To find the total hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes per day, each lasting 1 hour. So, the total hours per day for these days is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. Since there are 3 days, the total hours per week for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes per day, each lasting 2 hours. So, the total hours per day for these days is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. Since there are 2 days, the total hours per week for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. So, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together:

1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12:

3360 inches / 12 = 280 feet

"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he's running back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

3. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo.
4. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.

From point 3, we know Sally Four is 8 years old. 
From point 2, we know Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.
From point 1, we know Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of three birds: Sally Four (8), Granny Red (16), and Sally Two (19). 
The only bird left is Sally Thirtytwo, which we already know is 8 years old.

The total age of the four birds is 8 + 16 + 19 + 8 = 51.

The final answer is: 51"
"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate the total monthly payment and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the increased minimum payments:

- Student loans: $300 * 1.5 = $450
- Credit card: $200 * 1.5 = $300
- Mortgage: $500 * 1.5 = $750

Now, let's add up the increased minimum payments:
$450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

Since Jessica pays this amount every month, we multiply it by 12 to get the total annual payment:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut all the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes, then add the time it takes to cut one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)

Total time to peel all potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes
Total time to cut all potatoes: 60 potatoes * (5/60) minutes/potato = 5 minutes

Adding both times together: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

The final answer is: 95"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.
2. They make a profit of $25, so their total revenue is $25 + (costs) = $25 + ($3 + $2) * x, where x is the number of gallons they made.
3. Since their revenue per gallon is $10, the total revenue is 10x.
4. Setting up the equation: 10x = 25 + 5x
5. Subtracting 5x from both sides: 5x = 25
6. Dividing both sides by 5: x = 5
7. Now that we know they made 5 gallons, we can find the cost of lemons: cost of lemons = $3 * 5 = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the number of Chinese participants, we first need to subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants. 

Total participants = 240
Japanese participants = 80
Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Now, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team was 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls on the Chinese team = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 160 - 60
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much money Zaid has left, we need to follow the order of operations and calculate his expenses step by step.

1. Zaid earns 6000$ per month.
2. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent: 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$
3. He spends 1/3 on car fuel: 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$
4. Total expenses so far: 1500 + 2000 = 3500$
5. Remaining amount after rent and car fuel: 6000 - 3500 = 2500$
6. He donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity: 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$
7. Remaining amount after donation: 2500 - 1250 = 1250$
8. He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$: 200 + 700 = 900$
9. Total expenses for his daughter and wife: 900$
10. Remaining amount after expenses for his daughter and wife: 1250 - 900 = 350$

"Let's break down the information given:

- Bo has 40 crabs.
- Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
- Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

To find the total number of crabs the three have together, we add the number of crabs each one has: 
40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122

The final answer is: 122"
"To find out how much Lloyd earned in the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd tutored 5 hours at $10 an hour, so his earnings for the first week are:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

For the second week, Lloyd tutored 8 hours at $10 an hour, so his earnings for the second week are:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, let's add his earnings for both weeks:
$50 (first week) + $80 (second week) = $130

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the number of votes the winner got, we need to calculate 3/4 of the total number of students who voted. 

3/4 * 80 = 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, and the winner got 60 votes, the loser must have gotten the remaining votes. 

The number of votes the loser got is 80 - 60 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.
- She ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

Since the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations, the number of red roses is 4x.

We are given that the number of pink calla lilies is 200, so we can set up the equation 5x = 200 to find the value of x.

5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations is 40, we can find the number of red roses by multiplying 4 and 40.

Number of red roses = 4x = 4 * 40 = 160

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 3, we know Jan's current age is 30. 

Two years ago, Jan's age would have been 30 - 2 = 28.

From point 2, we know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 28 / 2 = 14. 

So, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Since Mark was 19 two years ago, his current age would be 19 + 2 = 21.

From point 1, we know Jean is two years older than Mark. Therefore, Jean's current age would be 21 + 2 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time for the well-rounded team, we multiply the time per runner by the number of runners: 55 seconds * 4 = 220 seconds.

For the less well-rounded team, the first runner runs 60 seconds, the second runner runs 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, the third runner runs 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth runner runs 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. We multiply these times by the number of runners: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To find the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3, we need to count the favorable outcomes and divide by the total number of outcomes.

There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 or 50%.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to count the favorable outcomes and divide by the total number of outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Now, we need to find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row. 

The difference in probability is 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

So, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom got 20 apples. 

Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, we can calculate the number of apples Jenna picked by dividing the number of apples her mom picked by 2. 

Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.

To find the total number of apples they both picked, we need to add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mom picked.

Total apples = 20 (mom's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30

"To find the number of rats in each cage, we first need to determine the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters and the rabbits. 

The hamsters are kept in 10 cages, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The rabbits are given 20 pieces of straw.

The total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters and the rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 70 pieces are given to the hamsters and the rabbits, the remaining straw pieces are given to the rats. So, the number of straw pieces given to the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's assume the number of rats in each cage is 'r'. Then, the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r.

The total number of straw pieces given to the rats is 90, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. So, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15.

Since the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r, we can set up the equation 3r = 15. Solving for 'r', we get r = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The initial amount owed is $100.
The monthly interest rate is 2% or 0.02.

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

The total interest is $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

The total amount Mandy should pay is the initial amount plus the total interest: $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

Rounded to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to first calculate the total cost and total revenue.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $400. So, we can set up the equation:

$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$8x = $400

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 8:

x = $400 / $8
x = 50

So, the trader sold 50 bags."
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, they spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75 on food.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to first find out how many minutes he collects peaches for. Since he collects peaches for 3 hours, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes per hour.

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now that we know John collects peaches for 180 minutes, and he can collect 2 peaches per minute, we multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks needs per day, we first need to find out how many pounds of insects they need per week. Since there are ten ducks and each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we multiply the number of ducks by the amount of insects each duck needs per week.

10 ducks * 3.5 pounds/duck/week = 35 pounds/week

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of insects they need per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total pounds of insects needed per week by 7.

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

"To find out how many trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the total number of trees he has after 10 years, and then subtract the trees that die.

Tom starts with 50 trees. 

Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. So, the net change in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8.

After 10 years, the total change in trees is 8 * 10 = 80.

So, the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years is 50 + 80 = 130.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find out how many trees die, we need to calculate 30% of 130.

30% of 130 is 0.3 * 130 = 39.

So, the number of trees that die is 39.

The number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91.

"To find the number of pink and white flamingos, let's break down the events:

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, there are now 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos, making the total number of pink flamingos 12 + 18 = 30.

Now, there are 6 white flamingos and 30 pink flamingos.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots used = Number of restaurants * Pounds per restaurant
Total pounds of carrots used = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots used = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total pounds of carrots used from the total pounds of carrots available to find out how many pounds will not be used.

"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to find the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the weight of the chocolate bars. Since there are 25 chocolate bars and each chocolate bar weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Next, let's find the weight of the candied apples. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. Since there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, let's add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples together to find the total weight of the bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates will cost 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we need to divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups. 

Cost per cup = Total cost of twenty dozen cups / Number of cups

The total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is $30 + $20 * 2 = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn. 

Let's calculate how much more money she needs to earn: $70 - $10 = $60.

Now, let's calculate how much she earns from babysitting: $5 * 4 = $20.

So, she needs to earn $60 - $20 = $40 more from mowing the lawn.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can divide the amount she needs to earn by the amount she earns per mowing: $40 / $4 = 10.

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park, l = 6 miles and w = 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(l + w)
P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed:

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Day 1: 100 customers
- Day 2: 50 more customers than Day 1, so 100 + 50 = 150 customers
- Total customers by Day 3: 500

To find the number of customers on Day 3, we need to subtract the total customers on Day 1 and Day 2 from the total customers by Day 3.

Customers on Day 3 = Total customers by Day 3 - (Customers on Day 1 + Customers on Day 2)
= 500 - (100 + 150)
= 500 - 250
= 250

The final answer is: 250"
"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of water loss for both pools is 8 gallons/minute in total.

In 4 minutes, the total water lost from both pools is 8 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 32 gallons.

The big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y'. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y.

We know that the initial amount of water in the big pool (2x) minus the water lost (32 gallons) is equal to the current amount of water in the big pool (4y). So, we can write the equation:

2x - 32 = 4y

We also know that the initial amount of water in the small pool (x) minus the water lost (32 gallons) is equal to the current amount of water in the small pool (y). So, we can write the equation:

x - 32 = y

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for x:

2(x - 32) - 32 = 4y
2x - 64 - 32 = 4y
2x - 96 = 4y

Now we can substitute the second equation (x - 32 = y) into this equation:

2(x - 32) - 96 = 4(x - 32)
2x - 64 - 96 = 4x - 128
-160 = 2x - 128
32 = 2x
16 = x

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into the equation x - 32 = y:

16 - 32 = y
-16 = y

However, since y represents the amount of water in the small pool, it cannot be negative. This means that our initial assumption about the direction of the leak is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of water loss for both pools is 8 gallons/minute in total.

In 4 minutes, the total water lost from both pools is 8 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 32 gallons.

The big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y'. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y.

We know that the initial amount of water in the big pool (2x) plus the water lost (32 gallons) is equal to the current amount of water in the big pool (4y). So, we can write the equation:

2x + 32 = 4y

We also know that the initial amount of water in the small pool (x) minus the water lost (32 gallons) is equal to the current amount of water in the small pool (y). So, we can write the equation:

x - 32 = y

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for x:

2(x - 32) + 32 = 4y
2x - 64 + 32 = 4y
2x - 32 = 4y

Now we can substitute the second equation (x - 32 = y) into this equation:

2(x - 32) + 32 = 4(x - 32)
2x - 64 + 32 = 4x - 128
-32 = 2x - 128
160 = 2x
80 = x

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into the equation x - 32 = y:

80 - 32 = y
48 = y

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn, which is the cost of the shoes and the belt. 

Total cost = cost of shoes + cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Now, we need to divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Hours to work = Total cost / hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00

"To find the total amount Janeth will pay, we need to calculate the total interest she will pay over 12 months. 

First, let's find the interest she will pay each month. 10% of $2000 is 0.1 x $2000 = $200. 

Since she will pay $165 a month, the remaining amount she will pay each month as interest is $200 - $165 = $35.

Now, let's find the total interest she will pay over 12 months. $35 x 12 = $420.

The total amount she will pay is the initial amount plus the interest. $2000 + $420 = $2420.

Since she will pay $165 a month for 12 months, the total amount she will pay is $165 x 12 = $1980.

The remaining balance will be the total amount she will pay minus the initial amount. $2420 - $1980 = $440.

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to know the number of dahlias. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age is 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years.
3. Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years.

Now, let's calculate their ages in three years:

1. Harriet's age in three years = 21 + 3 = 24 years.
2. Zack's age in three years = 42 + 3 = 45 years.
3. Adrian's age in three years = 63 + 3 = 66 years.

To find the average age of the three in three years, we need to add their ages and divide by 3:

Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored. 

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. 

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now we know the points scored by Naomi (68), Yuri (44), and Brianna (85). 
We can subtract the points scored by these three students from the total points to find out how many points Jojo scored. 
Total points = 251
Points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197
Points scored by Jojo = Total points - Points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna
Points scored by Jojo = 251 - 197

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then convert that to hours.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike receives from his remaining 3 pen pals. Since each of them sends 2 letters a week, and there are 3 of them, the total number of letters he receives is 2 * 3 = 6 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

4. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as x. After Ginger gave Griffin x fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, Griffin was left with (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.

- Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday.
- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
The total calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

"Let's break down the information given:

- Each class has 20 students.
- There are 3 classes.
- The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.
- The first class has 15 girls.
- The second class has 12 girls.

First, we need to find the total number of girls in the school. Since the first and second classes have 15 and 12 girls respectively, we can find the number of girls in the third class by subtracting the total number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school.

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls in the school is 50% of the total number of students. The total number of students in the school is 3 classes * 20 students per class = 60 students. 

50% of 60 is 0.5 * 60 = 30 girls in the school.

We know the first two classes have 15 + 12 = 27 girls. So, the third class has 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

Since the third class has 20 students and 3 girls, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find out how many apps Travis has now, we need to subtract the apps he deleted and add the apps he downloaded.

First, let's subtract the apps he deleted: 61 - 9 = 52

"Let's break down the information given:

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's denote the number of cougars killed today as x. Then, the number of wolves killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12 to find the number of wolves killed today. Solving for x, we get x = 4.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of wolves killed today, which is 3x = 3(4) = 12.

To find the total number of animals killed, we add the number of animals killed last night and today: 10 (wolves) + 15 (cougars) + 12 (wolves) + 12 (cougars) = 49.

The final answer is: 49"
"To find out which floor Bill is on, we need to calculate 4 times his starting floor (3) plus 6.

"To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we need to calculate 30% of 30, which is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we subtract 9 from 30 to get 30 - 9 = 21. 

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, so we multiply 21 by 4 to get 21 * 4 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

So, the number of cows added to each stall is 40 / 10 = 4 cows.

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8:

24 * 8 = 192

The final answer is: 192"
"To find the total amount of money Brady has, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill, and then add them together.

20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2
40 dollar bills = 40 x $1 = $40

Now, let's add the values together:
$1 + $2 + $2 + $40 = $45

The final answer is: $45"
"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections and then multiply it by the weight of each section. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of 8000 from the total weight. To find 30% of 8000, we multiply 8000 by 0.3: 8000 * 0.3 = 2400.

Now, we subtract 2400 from the total weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
2. Andrea has 52 apples, so Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.
4. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.
5. To find the total number of fruits, we need to add the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have. 
   Total fruits = (Andrea's apples + Jamal's apples + Andrea's bananas + Jamal's bananas)

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we first need to determine how many cups of flour are needed for each day. 

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies Carla is making. 

36 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 3 dozen cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, Carla will need 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour for today.

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. Again, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies she is making.

30 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 2.5 dozen cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, Carla will need 2.5 * 2 = 5 cups of flour for tomorrow.

In total, Carla will need 6 cups of flour for today and 5 cups of flour for tomorrow, which is 6 + 5 = 11 cups of flour.

"To find the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first find two thirds of 9,300. 

Two thirds of 9,300 can be calculated as (2/3) * 9,300. 

To do this, we multiply 9,300 by 2 and then divide by 3. 

9,300 * 2 = 18,600 

18,600 / 3 = 6,200 

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62.00

The final answer is: $62.00"
"To find out how many marbles Maddison has now, we need to first calculate the total number of marbles she had initially and then add the marbles she received from her friend.

Maddison has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box, so the total number of marbles she had initially is:
5 boxes * 50 marbles/box = 250 marbles

Then, she received 20 marbles from her friend. To find the total number of marbles she has now, we add the marbles she received to the initial number of marbles:
250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles

"To find the total price of the house, we need to add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is the sum of the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

"To find the time it takes to heat up to 400 degrees, we need to calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 x 20 = 8 minutes. 
So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 20 + 28 + 23 = 71 minutes.

There are 2 houses with 3 bedrooms each, so the total number of bedrooms is 2 * 3 = 6. 

Each bedroom has 2 windows, so the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12.

There are 4 additional windows in each house not connected to bedrooms, so the total number of additional windows is 2 * 4 = 8.

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, and the body takes 900 stitches, the total number of stitches for the sleeves is 1800 - 900 - 270 = 630 stitches.

We are given that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write the equation: R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write the equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Now, we can substitute R = 6S into the second equation: 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Expanding the equation, we get: 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get: 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get: 3S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: S = 6.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are available in total, we multiply the number of packets by the number of chocolate bars in each packet: 8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars.

Since each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, we multiply the number of adults by the number of chocolate bars each adult gets: 4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars.

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars.

These 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among the 8 children. To find out how many each child gets, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars/child.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time. 

3 hours = 180 minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes)
180 minutes - 30 minutes (pause) = 150 minutes

Now, we know Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Since Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the amount she earns per interval.

15 intervals * $5 per interval = $75

- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point, making it 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point, making it 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players: 
Mike: 22 points
Jim: 18 points
Tony: 43 points
Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points

The final answer is: 83"
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we first need to determine how many oranges the sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, and he washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 8 oranges. 

The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Gustavo bought 15 oranges, and the sons washed 12 oranges. To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges: 15 - 12 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total count of activities, we need to calculate the number of activities for each day and add them together.

Day 1: 
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Total for Day 1: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

Day 2: 
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Total for Day 2: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

Total count of activities in two days: 170 + 200 = 370

The final answer is: 370"
"To find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day. 

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, each person consumes 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per day (2 kg).

42 kg / 2 kg per day = 21 days

Since we want to know how many weeks the rice will last, we need to convert the number of days to weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the number of days by 7.

21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks. 

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold and subtract that from his target.

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he didn't sell any crates on those days. He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 on Tuesday, 12 on Wednesday, and 18 on Thursday.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday)
Total crates sold = 65

Now, we subtract the total crates sold from the target to find out how many crates Sam was off from his target.

Target = 120
Total crates sold = 65
Crates off target = Target - Total crates sold
Crates off target = 120 - 65
Crates off target = 55

The final answer is: 55"
"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to determine the last bid made by Carmen. 

The initial bid is $200. Three other people bid once, so the desk price increases by $50 three times. 

The total increase in price is 3 * $50 = $150. 

Adding this to the initial bid, the desk price before Carmen's last bid is $200 + $150 = $350. 

Since Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, she makes 4 bids in total (including her initial bid). 

Each bid increases the price by $50, so the total increase in price due to Carmen's bids is 4 * $50 = $200. 

Adding this to the desk price before Carmen's last bid, the total cost of the desk is $350 + $200 = $550.

The final answer is: $550"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total miles driven, the total cost of driving, and the total bonus.

1. Total miles driven: Since John goes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 = 60 miles. 
   He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven per year is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15000 miles.

2. Total cost of driving: He gets charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of driving per year is 15000 * $2 = $30000.

3. Total bonus: He gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus per year is $150 * 12 = $1800.

4. Total cost: The total cost is the sum of the total cost of driving and the total bonus, which is $30000 + $1800 = $31800.

The final answer is: $31800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider how the pages are arranged after folding. 

When a piece of paper is folded, the front and back sides become the left and right sides of the folded paper. 

For a 32-page tabloid, we can think of it as having 16 pages on each side (since 32 / 2 = 16). 

However, since the pages are printed on both sides, we need to consider the number of pages that can be printed on each piece of paper. 

Each piece of paper can have 4 pages printed on it: 

- Left back (page 1)
- Left front (page 2)
- Right back (page 32)
- Right front (page 31)

Since we have 16 pages on each side, we need 16 / 4 = 4 pieces of paper to print all the pages on one side. 

Since there are two sides, we need 4 pieces of paper for one side and 4 pieces of paper for the other side. 

So, the total number of pieces of paper needed is 4 + 4 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much Annika spent on food and snacks, we need to calculate half of the $50 she brought. 

Half of $50 is $50 / 2 = $25.

She spent an additional $10 on rides. 

So, the total amount she spent is $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35.

To find out how much is left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount she brought: 

$50 (initial amount) - $35 (total spent) = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total books = 250
- Unsold books = 50
- Books sold this year = 45
- Books sold in the first year = 2 * Books sold this year = 2 * 45 = 90
- Books sold in the second year = Total books - Unsold books - Books sold this year - Books sold in the first year
= 250 - 50 - 45 - 90
= 65

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
Total money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book
= 65 * 20
= 1300

The final answer is: $1300"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

In a month, there are approximately 4 weeks. So, his total earnings from his hourly wage in April are:
$500/week * 4 weeks = $2000

Additionally, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. Since the company performed well for the whole month, he gets a bonus for 4 weeks:
$300/week * 4 weeks = $1200

Now, let's add his earnings from his hourly wage and the bonus to find his total earnings in April:
$2000 + $1200 = $3200

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to find 20% of 20, since he beat 80% of the people.

"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we first need to determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves. 

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. 

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

60 (total loaves) - 40 (morning sales) = 20 loaves left.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. 

Half of 20 is calculated as (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are divided equally between the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much weight Sandy loses in a week, we need to divide the total weight Joey loses in 4 weeks by 4. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so in one week, Joey loses 8 / 4 = 2 pounds.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks. 

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey in a week, we need to divide the total weight by the weight Sandy loses in a week. 

Since Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks, it will take Sandy 4 / 2 = 2 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in a week.

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings from buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. The discounted price is 2 x $11 = $22. So, the savings from buying 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. The discounted price is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2. So, the savings from buying 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we need to calculate how much he has spent so far and subtract the amount he wants to save from his initial budget.

1. Calculate the cost of the business suits: 6 suits * $100 = $600
2. Calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 = $150
3. Calculate the cost of the flight ticket: The cost of a business suit is $100, so 5 times this amount is $500. The flight ticket costs $700 more than this, so the cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200.
4. Calculate the total cost so far: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950
5. Calculate how much Theo has left after buying the suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket: $6000 (initial budget) - $1950 (total cost so far) = $4050

1. Trent is 5 years older than Jane.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.
3. Quinn is 30 years old.

Since Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, we can find Jane's age by subtracting 3 from Quinn's age:
Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now that we know Jane's age, we can find Trent's age by adding 5 to Jane's age:

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is D/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. We are given that the total number of players is 105. 

So, we can write the equation: D + 2D + D/2 = 105

To solve for D, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2D + 4D + D = 210

Combine like terms: 7D = 210

Divide both sides by 7: D = 30

The number of players on the defense is 30.

Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24 people

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, we subtract those from the total:
24 - 8 = 16 people

Then, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 2 people. So, we subtract those from the number of people who couldn't come due to illness:

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156.

"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

1 (electric pole) / 3 (electric wires) = x (electric poles) / 45 (electric wires)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

1 * 45 = 3x
45 = 3x

Now, divide both sides by 3 to find x:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women at the party. 

The total number of people at the party is 25 + 15 = 40.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. To find out how many people left, we need to calculate 1/4 of 40, which is 40 * 1/4 = 10.

So, 10 people left the party. Since 22 men stayed, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. This means that 10 - 3 = 7 women left the party.

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 left. To find out how many women are left, we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.

"Let's break down the problem. Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this:

3x + 2 = 26

where x is the number of pencils in each box. To find x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Then, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box has 8 pencils. Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 * 8 = 24 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils is 24 + 46 = 70.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each box:

70 / 8 = 8.75

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so the number of ice cubes needed is 65 / 13 = 5.

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes will make it 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Now, let's add the effect of the cream. The coffee is already 60 milliliters weaker due to the ice cubes, and then 15 milliliters of cream is added, making it 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters weaker.

The final answer is: 75"
"Let's break down the problem. 

Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can assume that the ratio of new records to old records is 1:2. This means that for every 1 new record, 2 old records are traded.

Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of new records as 7. 

Now, we can use the ratio to find the total number of old records. If 1 new record is equal to 2 old records, then 7 new records would be equal to 7 * 2 = 14 old records.

However, this is the total number of old records traded by all 5 people. To find the number of old records each person brought in, we need to divide the total number of old records by the number of people.

So, the total number of old records is 14, and the number of people is 5. 

14 / 5 = 2.8

However, since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we can also consider that the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records, and the 2 extra records must have been brought in by 2 of the people. 

So, 2 people brought in 2 records each, and 3 people brought in 4 records each. 

2 * 2 + 3 * 4 = 6 + 12 = 18

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of junior programmers. The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. 

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, the salary of a senior programmer is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, let's calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately.

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of a junior programmer
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of a senior programmer
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

Now, let's add the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers to find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.

Total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $184000

The final answer is: $184000"
"Let's break down the information given:

- At the first bus stop, 5 people got in.
- At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 people got in.
- At the third stop, there were a total of 20 people.

We can represent the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'. 

Initially, there were 'x' people on the bus. 
At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total became x + 5.
At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.
Then, 8 people got in, so the total became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6.
We are given that at the third stop, there were a total of 20 people, so we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 20.

Now, let's solve for x:
x + 6 = 20
x = 20 - 6
x = 14

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
2. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
3. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
4. He eats 3 more lollipops that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
5. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first find out how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

Since the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can find the time it takes to charge 40% by multiplying 40 by 3. 

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 / 60 = 2 hours

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone. 

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to first calculate the total number of lollipops she has after her mother gives her 10 more. 

Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so Erin now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to subtract 3 from 17. 

17 - 3 = 14

So, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards they earned from their last shopping trip, apply the rewards and the coupon to this shopping trip, and then subtract the total from the amount they spent on this trip.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip, which means they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. Since they had 4 rewards, they used $4 off the price. 

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8. 

So, the total discount they got is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

To find out how much they paid, we subtract the total discount from the amount they spent: $43 - $12 = $31.

"To find the net pay for Job A, we need to calculate the total income and then subtract the taxes. 

Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year. 
Total income for Job A = $15 * 2000 = $30,000
Total tax for Job A = $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
Net pay for Job A = $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B, we need to subtract the property tax first, then calculate the income tax.
Property tax for Job B = $6,000
Net income for Job B before tax = $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
Income tax for Job B = $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
Net pay for Job B = $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs, we subtract the net pay of Job A from the net pay of Job B.
Difference in net pay = Net pay for Job B - Net pay for Job A = $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the shares after the first year and then after the second year.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1 + 0.5 = 1.5). 
New price = 8 * 1.5 = $12.

Now, the stock price decreases by 25% in the second year. To find the new price, we multiply the price from the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%, or 1 - 0.25 = 0.75).
New price = 12 * 0.75 = $9.

The final value of Maria's shares is 8 * 9 = $72.

"Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. 

So, we can write the equation: 2x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3: x = 70

Since the smallest group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by substituting x = 70 into the expression: 70 - 10 = 60

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down the information given. Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. 

Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as 2C (since he has twice as many chickens as cows). 

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation: C + 2C = 60. 

Combining like terms, we get 3C = 60. 

Dividing both sides by 3, we get C = 20. 

So, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is 2C = 2(20) = 40.

Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. 

The total number of legs of the chickens is 40 * 2 = 80. 

The total number of legs of the cows is 20 * 4 = 80.

The total number of legs of all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

2. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Andrea started with $36. She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4. To find out how much she spent in total, we add the cost of the sweater and the money she gave her brother: $11 + $4 = $15.

Now, we need to subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she had: $36 - $15 = $21.

So, Andrea saved $21."
"To find the total time John spent, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them up.

Time spent boating: 6 hours
Time spent swimming: 6 / 2 = 3 hours
Time spent watching shows: 3 shows * 2 hours per show = 6 hours
Total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours

Since the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time, we can set up the equation: 30% * Total time = 6 hours
To find the total time, we can divide both sides by 0.3 (which is 30% as a decimal): Total time = 6 / 0.3 = 20 hours

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time: Time spent sightseeing = 40% * 20 hours = 0.4 * 20 = 8 hours

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate how much money she has earned and subtract that from the total cost of the phone.

First, let's calculate how much she earned from her first job:
20 hours * $10 per hour = $200

Next, let's calculate how much she earned from her second job:
15 hours * $5 per hour = $75

Now, let's add the money she earned from both jobs:
$200 + $75 = $275

Annabelle already had $80 in her savings, so let's add that to the money she earned:
$275 + $80 = $355

Now, let's subtract the total amount she has from the cost of the phone:
$400 - $355 = $45

Annabelle still needs to save $45."
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the combined height of the two shorter trees. 

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. 
The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

The combined height of the two shorter trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The tallest tree is twice the height of the two shorter trees combined, so its height is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is 34 feet."
"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money he spent and then add the extra $10 his mother gave him.

First, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on toy cars: 6 toy cars * $2 = $12
Then, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on teddy bears: 5 teddy bears * $1 = $5
Now, let's add the cost of the toy cars and the teddy bears: $12 + $5 = $17
Dean started with $28, so we subtract the amount he spent from the initial amount: $28 - $17 = $11
Finally, his mother gave him an extra $10, so we add that to the remaining amount: $11 + $10 = $21

The final answer is: $21"
"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
Since there are 'x' friends, the total cost for mini-golf for all of them is 1 + x * $5. 

The cost of arcade tokens is $5. 
The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 rides * $10 = $20. 
Since there are 'x' friends, the total cost for go-karts for all of them is 2 + 2x * $10 = $20 + $20x.

The total cost of the activities is the sum of the costs of mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts: 
Total cost = (1 + x) * $5 + $5 + (2 + 2x) * $10.

Simplifying the equation: 
Total cost = $5 + $5x + $5 + $20 + $20x 
Total cost = $30 + $25x

We know that the total budget is $90. 
So, we can set up the equation: 
$30 + $25x = $90

Subtracting $30 from both sides: 
$25x = $60

Dividing both sides by $25: 
x = $60 / $25
x = 2.4

Since we can't invite a fraction of a friend, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. 
x = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to first calculate how much she spends on lollipops each day and then subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Marisa buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so she spends 4 x 25 = 100 cents or $1 per day on lollipops.

Her daily pocket money is $5, so she saves $5 - $1 = $4 per day.

If she saves for 5 days, she will save a total of 5 x $4 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Billy starts with $10.
2. He buys candy, and we need to find out how many pounds he bought. Let's call the number of pounds 'x'. The cost of the candy is $1.5x.
3. After buying the candy, Billy has $10 - $1.5x left.
4. He takes half of this change, which is ($10 - $1.5x) / 2.
5. He spends this amount on gumballs, which cost $0.05 each. He bought 40 gumballs, so the total cost of gumballs is 40 * $0.05 = $2.
6. The amount he spent on gumballs is equal to half of his change, so ($10 - $1.5x) / 2 = $2.
7. Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: $10 - $1.5x = $4.
8. Subtract $10 from both sides: -$1.5x = -$6.
9. Divide both sides by -1.5: x = 4.

"Let's break down the information given. Carver's age is 45, and it's 5 years less than twice the age of his son. 

Let's represent the son's age as 'x'. 

The statement ""Carver's age is 5 years less than twice the age of his son"" can be written as an equation: 2x - 5 = 45.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. 

First, we add 5 to both sides of the equation: 2x - 5 + 5 = 45 + 5
This simplifies to: 2x = 50

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for 'x': (2x) / 2 = 50 / 2
This simplifies to: x = 25

The son's age is 25 years.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the cities. 

Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
Distance from the third city to the first city: 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs)
Total distance in one trip: 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is:
225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles/day

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the distance it travels in a day (675 miles):
18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days

So, the train goes approximately 26.67 days between services."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds, we need to find the average of the stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds. 

The average is calculated by adding the two values and dividing by 2. 

Average stuffing for collie beds = (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua and collie beds. 

For 4 chihuahua beds: 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.
For 3 collie beds: 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Total amount of stuffing needed = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we first need to find the total number of students present on Friday. 

Total students = 96
Absent girls = 5
Absent boys = 4
Total absent students = 5 + 4 = 9

Total students present = Total students - Total absent students
Total students present = 96 - 9
Total students present = 87

Now, we know that 43 girls were at the school initially. So, the number of girls present on Friday would be:
Girls present = Total girls - Absent girls
Girls present = 43 - 5
Girls present = 38

Now, we can find the number of boys present on Friday by subtracting the number of girls present from the total students present:
Boys present = Total students present - Girls present
Boys present = 87 - 38
Boys present = 49

"Let's break down the information given:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, four times that many is 4 * 3 = 12. 
   Four times that many minus 5 is 12 - 5 = 7. So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   Since 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting, three times that many is 3 * 7 = 21. 
   So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.

Now, let's add up the number of customers kicked out for each reason:
- Refusing to wear masks: 3
- Shoplifting: 7
- Physical violence over goods on sale: 21

Total number of customers kicked out for these reasons: 3 + 7 + 21 = 31

Since a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
50 - 31 = 19

"Let's break down the information given. Erin now has 14 points and has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points. 

Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can express Erin's points as 3 times Sara's points plus Sara's points. 

Let's represent Sara's points as S. Erin's points can be expressed as 3S + S = 4S. 

We know Erin now has 14 points, so we can set up the equation 4S = 14. 

To find Sara's points, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: S = 14 / 4 = 3.5. 

However, since Sara scored 8 points, we can conclude that the information given is inconsistent. 

But if we assume the question is asking for Erin's points before she scored 14, we can represent Erin's points before as E. We know that after scoring 14 points, Erin has 3 times more points than Sara. 

So, E + 14 = 3 * 8. 

E + 14 = 24 

To find E, we subtract 14 from both sides of the equation: E = 24 - 14 = 10.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each picture frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors. So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of etching the logo on each picture frame. The etching costs an additional 20% of the cost of the picture frame. 20% of $20 is $4. So, the total cost of etching is 44 * $4 = $176.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers. Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12. So, the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we can add up the total cost of the picture frames, etching, pins, and cords to find the total cost of the senior gifts. $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"
"To find the total cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the materials cost first. 

The original price of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

Since making it yourself saves 20%, that means you save 20% of $400. 
20% of $400 = 0.2 * $400 = $80

So, the materials cost is $400 - $80 = $320.

The total cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold on each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract those from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday. 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add up the total number of shoes sold: 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we need to multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold. 50 * 2 = 100.

"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the value of the faulty pieces and subtract it from the total amount spent.

The total amount spent is $400,000. 
40% of the total amount is faulty, so the value of the faulty pieces is 40% of $400,000.

40% of $400,000 = 0.4 * $400,000 = $160,000

Now, we subtract the value of the faulty pieces from the total amount spent to find the value of the functioning pieces.

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest she has to pay and then divide it by the number of months.

The formula to calculate simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Given values:
Principal (P) = $3,650
Rate (R) = 10% or 0.10
Time (T) = 5 months

Interest = P * R * T
= $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
= $1,825

Now, we need to add the interest to the principal to find the total amount Karan has to pay:
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
= $3,650 + $1,825
= $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we divide the total amount by the number of months:

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.

First, let's find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * $2 = $4.

Since they ride all 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha to buy tickets for all 9 rides is 9 * $4 = $36.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.

The cost for Dasha to ride all 9 rides is $36, and the cost for David to ride all 9 rides is $30.

"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to find out how many popsicles each of them has. 

Let's assume the number of popsicles Betty has is 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has is 6x. 

Since the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can write the equation: 5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms: 11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11: x = 15

Now that we know x, we can find the number of popsicles each of them has. Betty has 5x = 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles. Sam has 6x = 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15

"To find out how much Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

The cost of Netflix is $10 a month.

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus individually is $10 each, so together they would be $20. However, since Tim bundles them, he saves 20% of the total cost. 

20% of $20 is 0.2 x $20 = $4. 

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Since Tim cancels his $60 cable package, the amount he saves is $60 - $26 = $34.

Total time spent = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours

Now, we need to find the percentage of time spent editing. To do this, we'll divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100.

Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of books Wendy wants to place, we first need to determine the total number of books in the shelving system. Since it has 6 rows and 6 columns, we multiply the number of rows by the number of columns to get the total number of spaces for books.

6 rows * 6 columns = 36 spaces

Now, we need to double this number and add 20 to it. 

36 * 2 = 72
72 + 20 = 92

So, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

The final answer is: 92"
"To find out how many Valentine's cards Erica has now, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, received, and then subtract the ones she passed out.

Initially, Erica made 20 Valentine's cards.

Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each, so she received 2 * 15 = 30 cards.

She passed out 24 to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

She received 17 cards from family and friends.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has now:

Initial cards + cards received - cards given away = total cards now
20 + 30 - 29 + 17 = 38

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards."
"To find out how many slices are left, we first need to determine how many slices Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, 1/3 of 12 is 12 * (1/3) = 4 slices. 

Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. 1/4 of 12 is 12 * (1/4) = 3 slices.

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so the total number of slices she gave away and ate is 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

The number of slices left is 12 - 9 = 3 slices.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many days Mark has to save his money, we need to divide the cost of the bike by the amount he earns per day.

Cost of the bike: $300
Amount earned per day: $10

Number of days = Cost of the bike / Amount earned per day
= $300 / $10
= 30

So, Mark has to save his money for 30 days to buy the bike.

30"
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Nancy saw 90 spiders. The number of millipedes is 1/3rd as many as spiders, so the number of millipedes is 90 / 3 = 30.

The number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12, so the number of stink bugs is 2 * 30 - 12 = 48.

Now, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs: 90 + 30 + 48 = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Erica is 30 years old.
- Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so Beth is 30 + 5 = 35 years old.
- Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice is 35 + 7 = 42 years old.

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 42 - 30 = 12 years.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many calories John consumed, we need to first find out how many ounces of milk he drank. Since a glass of milk is 8 ounces and John drank 2 glasses, he drank 8 * 2 = 16 ounces of milk.

Since milk has 3 calories per ounce, we multiply the total ounces of milk John drank by the calories per ounce: 16 * 3 = 48.

So, John consumed 48 calories."
"To find out how much the builder earns in a year, we need to calculate his daily earnings, then multiply it by the number of days he works in a year.

First, let's find out how many days he works in a year. He works 4 weeks every month, and there are 12 months in a year. 

Number of weeks worked in a year = 4 weeks/month * 12 months = 48 weeks/year

Since he works 6 days a week, the total number of days he works in a year is:
Total days worked in a year = 48 weeks/year * 6 days/week = 288 days/year

Now, let's find out his daily earnings:
Daily earnings = $50/day

Now, we can find out his total earnings in a year:
Total earnings in a year = Daily earnings * Total days worked in a year
Total earnings in a year = $50/day * 288 days/year
Total earnings in a year = $14400/year

The final answer is: $14400"
"To find out how many bags of flour Mark needs to buy, we need to divide the total amount of flour required by the amount of flour in each bag. 

For a quadruple batch, the total amount of flour required is 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups. 
Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs to buy 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour.

To find out how many bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we need to divide the total amount of milk required by the amount of milk in each bottle. 

For a quadruple batch, the total amount of milk required is 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups. 
Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark needs to buy 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we need to subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour. 

6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to find the original energy used per day. 

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Since it's used for 8 hours a day, the energy used per day is 900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, the new usage is 8 - 5 = 3 hours per day. The new energy used per day is 900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours or 2.7 kWh per day.

The energy saved per day is the original energy used per day minus the new energy used per day: 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh per day.

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30: 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh.

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the average number of stripes, we need to find the total number of stripes and divide it by the total number of zebras.

There are two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.
There is one zebra with 36 stripes.
There is another zebra with half the number of stripes as the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

The total number of stripes is 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.
The total number of zebras is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

The average number of stripes is the total number of stripes divided by the total number of zebras, which is 88 / 4 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find out how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves. 

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, Tyson will need 5 pounds of each.

The cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
The cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Allan initially has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.
2. Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store, so now he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.
3. He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.
4. Now, Allan has a total of 80 (initial corns) + 60 (new corns) = 140 corns.
5. The total number of cannolis is 100.
6. The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 140 (corns) + 100 (cannolis) = 240.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.
- He also took 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
- After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps.

So far, Elliott has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps. To reach his goal, he needs to take 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 more steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, the number of steps he took during his jog would be 4,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To find out how many minutes Toby will be early, we need to calculate the total time it will take him to read the book and travel to the airport, and then subtract that from the time he has available.

First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:
45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Next, let's calculate the time it will take Toby to read the book:
9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Now, let's add the time it will take to get to the airport:
30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes

Since Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave for the airport, we can subtract the total time from the available time to find out how many minutes early he will be:
60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. So, the company had 40 - 10 = 30 employees in June. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds and the sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off,"" we can consider it as a 2-pound purchase with a discount on the second pound. The first pound costs $3, and the second pound is half off, which is $3 / 2 = $1.50. So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. She bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework.

The first package of fireworks costs $400. The second package costs twice that much, so it's 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

He gets a 20% discount on the fireworks. To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.20: $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discount is subtracted from the total cost: $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150.

The total amount spent is the cost of the fireworks with the discount plus the cost of the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate how many cookies she will eat in 30 days. 

Since Shannon eats 2 cookies a night, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of nights in 30 days. 

There are 30 nights in 30 days. 

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since Shannon's recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make.

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen cookies

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two conditions.

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50,000 candles smell like wet dog, so we multiply 50,000 by 0.05:

50,000 * 0.05 = 2,500 candles that smell like wet dog

Next, we need to find the number of candles that are more dangerous and have a 1% chance of exploding. However, the problem states that 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog, and the remaining 95% are the ones that are more dangerous but do not smell like wet dog. So, 95% of the candles that smell like wet dog are the ones that are more dangerous. 

To find the number of candles that smell like wet dog and are more dangerous, we multiply the number of candles that smell like wet dog by 0.95:

2,500 * 0.95 = 2,375 candles that smell like wet dog and are more dangerous

Now, we need to find the number of candles that are more dangerous and smell like wet dog and explode. 1% of the more dangerous candles explode, so we multiply the number of candles that smell like wet dog and are more dangerous by 0.01:

2,375 * 0.01 = 23.75

Since we can't have a fraction of a candle, we round down to the nearest whole number.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The average trees are not specified, so let's call the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees 'x'.
- The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 45 + x.
- The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.
- The combined total is 500, so 45 + x + 105 = 500.

Now, let's solve for x:
45 + x + 105 = 500
x + 150 = 500
x = 350

"Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We know that the total number of heads is 180, so we can write the equation:

C + D = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304. Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can write the equation:

2C + D = 304

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve for C and D by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know C, we can substitute it into the first equation to solve for D:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

So, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each part of the trip and add them together.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

In the next 2 days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 km is:
(30/100) * 800 km = 240 km
So, the total distance traveled in the next 2 days is 240 km.

In the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each part of the trip:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. To find out how many cats were taken away, we multiply the number of boats by the number of cats each boat carried: 4 * 5 = 20 cats.

So, after the boats took away 20 cats, the number of cats remaining on the rock is: 50 - 20 = 30 cats.

Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find out how many cats ran after the mouse, we multiply the number of remaining cats by 3/5: 30 * (3/5) = 18 cats.

Now, we need to subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different periods and calculate the cost for each period.

1. The first 6 months cost $8 per month, so the total cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.
2. The next 8 months cost $12 per month, so the total cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.
3. The remaining months in 2 years (24 months) minus the first 14 months (6 + 8) is 24 - 14 = 10 months. The cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the cost of the jogger jeans be x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the cost of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

The total savings is $6, and Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means he saved 1/3 * 6 = 2 from the jogger jeans and 6 - 2 = 4 from the tattered jeans.

The savings from the jogger jeans is 2, so the cost of the jogger jeans is 2 * 3 = 6. 

Now we know the cost of the jogger jeans is 6 and the cost of the tattered jeans is 6 + 6 = 12.

The difference in cost between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is 12 - 6 = 6.

The jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans.

- Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, so she has a total of 6 bird feeders.
- The store-bought bird feeders attract 20 birds each.
- The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Since there are 3 store-bought bird feeders, they attract a total of 3 * 20 = 60 birds.
Since there are 3 bird feeders made by Lillian, they attract a total of 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we add the number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders and the number of birds attracted by the feeders Lillian made herself: 60 + 90 = 150.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how many cards he sold. Since he has $50 in spending cash and the ticket costs $100, he needs to make $50 from selling the cards. 

Let's denote the total number of cards as 'x'. Since he sells each card for $1.5, the total amount he makes from selling the cards is 1.5x. 

Since he keeps 1/3 of the cards, he sells 2/3 of the cards. The amount he makes from selling the cards is equal to the amount he needs to make, which is $50. 

So, we can set up the equation: 1.5 * (2/3)x = 50

To solve for x, we can multiply 1.5 by 2/3, which is equal to 1. Multiply both sides of the equation by 3/1 to get rid of the fraction: 
1.5 * 2/3 * x * 3/1 = 50 * 3/1
1.5 * 2 * x = 150
3x = 150

Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:
3x / 3 = 150 / 3
x = 50

"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many guests were expected to have two hotdogs. Since half of the 36 guests were expected to have two hotdogs, we can calculate this as 36 / 2 = 18 guests.

The caterer prepared enough hotdogs for these 18 guests to have two hotdogs each, which is a total of 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that 40 guests in total wanted a second hotdog, but the caterer only prepared 36 hotdogs for the 18 guests who were expected to have two hotdogs.

Since the caterer only had 36 hotdogs, and 40 guests wanted a second hotdog, 4 guests did not get a second hotdog because there were not enough hotdogs for everyone.

Dora has a total of $2 (her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 (total cost) - $18 (amount she has) = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to first determine how many dragons Prince Arthur and Prince Walter slew. 

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, who slew 100 dragons. Three quarters of 100 is 75. 

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so Prince Bruce slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to find out how much gas was in one container. 

15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, so each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons of gas.

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, she needed 1/4 * 3 = 0.75 gallons of gas.

To convert gallons to pints, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, 0.75 gallons is equal to 0.75 * 8 = 6 pints.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume George started with x dollars. Since he had 1% of his money left after buying chips, he spent 99% of his money. We know he spent $5, so we can set up the equation:

0.99x = 5

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.99:

x = 5 / 0.99
x = 5.05

So George started with $5.05.

We know he bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so the total cost of chips is:

3 x 0.40 = 1.20

He spent $5 in total, so the amount he spent on candy bars is:

5 - 1.20 = 3.80

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, the number of candy bars he bought is:

3.80 / 0.75 = 5.07

Since you can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that 5 candy bars would cost 3.75, and 6 candy bars would cost 4.50, so the only way to get a total of 3.80 is to buy 5 candy bars and 0.20 more. Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we can't buy 0.20 more candy bars, but we can buy 5 candy bars and 20 cents more. However, we can't buy 20 cents more candy bars, but we can buy 5 candy bars and 20 cents more. Since we can't buy 20 cents more candy bars, we can buy 5 candy bars and 20 cents more.

"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to subtract the lollipops he kept from the total and then divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.

Ray had 25 lollipops initially. He kept 5, so we subtract 5 from 25:
25 - 5 = 20

Now, we divide the remaining lollipops (20) by the number of friends (4):
20 / 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the remaining weight of the cake, we first need to find out how much the cake weighed after Rory and her mom each had a piece. 

Since there are 8 pieces in total and 2 of them were eaten, 8 - 2 = 6 pieces are left.

Each piece is 20 ounces / 8 = 2.5 ounces.

So, the remaining cake weighs 6 * 2.5 = 15 ounces.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to first find the total number of oranges they have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

They are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, including themselves, so the total number of people sharing the oranges is 8.

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people = 56 / 8 = 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and divide it by the number of servings.

Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which costs 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we first need to determine how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater. Since it takes four times as long for Bernadette to get to the theater as it does for Wayne, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes, it will take Bernadette 4 * 4 = 16 minutes to get to the theater.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

So Bernadette should leave 21 minutes before Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. 

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so 3 yards is equal to 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length times width. We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can set up the equation:

Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width

To find the width, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9:

width = 360 / 9
width = 40 feet

Now that we know the width is 40 feet and the length is 9 feet, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is 2 times the length plus 2 times the width:

Perimeter = 2 * length + 2 * width
Perimeter = 2 * 9 + 2 * 40
Perimeter = 18 + 80
Perimeter = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads they bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Difference in beads = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
= 140 - 60
= 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven is on for 3 hours, and it raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase is 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window. The window is open for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes, so for 30 minutes, it cools down 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the final temperature. The initial temperature is 40 degrees. The temperature increase due to the oven is 15 degrees, and the temperature decrease due to the open window is 6 degrees. So, the final temperature is 40 + 15 - 6 = 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we first need to find out how long it took him to complete the entire triathlon. 

First, let's convert Jon's times into minutes: 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it took James to swim and bike. 
- James' swim time is 10% faster than Jon's, so it's 40 - (40 * 0.1) = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.
- James' bike time is 5 minutes longer than Jon's, so it's 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it took James to run. 
Total time for James: 180 minutes
Time for James to swim and bike: 36 + 85 = 121 minutes
Time for James to run: 180 - 121 = 59 minutes

The final answer is: 59"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then divide it by 4.

Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so it is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so it is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to calculate the distance it runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, we need to convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 

Distance = Speed * Time = 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to calculate the number of eggs in the cases and add the loose eggs. 

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so to find out how many glasses Rozanne can make, we divide the total number of eggs by 5. 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

To find out how many points Marcy has after her turn, we need to add the points she scored to her initial points.

Marcy's initial points: 225
Points scored by Marcy: 10
Marcy's new points: 225 + 10 = 235

Now, we need to find the difference between Joey's new points and Marcy's new points to determine by how many points Joey is winning.

Joey's new points: 240
Marcy's new points: 235
Difference: 240 - 235 = 5

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday:
17 sneakers were sold for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 x $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sale to the department store:
There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left, and they were sold for $25 each.
The revenue from the sale to the department store is:
31 x $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the sale to the department store:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The initial cost of the case of sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The final answer is: $539"
"To find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets with eight pieces each and the four packets with sixteen pieces each.

For the six packets with eight pieces each, the total number of crayons is 6 x 8 = 48.

For the four packets with sixteen pieces each, the total number of crayons is 4 x 16 = 64.

Now, we add the total number of crayons from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

"Let's break down the information given. 

If you buy a super ticket for $20 and get a popcorn and a soda for $1 extra, the total cost is $21. 

If you buy a regular ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular price, the total cost is $12 + (popcorn price + soda price). 

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of the regular ticket and the snacks is $21 - $2 = $19.

We know the soda costs $3, so the popcorn price can be represented as x. 

The equation for the total cost of the regular ticket and snacks is 12 + x + 3 = 19.

Simplifying the equation, we get x + 15 = 19.

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get x = 4.

The regular price of popcorn is $4. 

The final answer is: $4"
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find x, we divide both sides by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is:

New cost = Original cost + Increase
New cost = 45 + 20
New cost = 65

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price:

Cost of filling 170 balloons = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
Cost of filling 170 balloons = 65 * 170
Cost of filling 170 balloons = 11050

The final answer is: 11050"
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles

Then, let's calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time = 30 mph x 1 hour = 30 miles

Now, let's add the distances to find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Next, let's add the times to find the total time taken:
Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Finally, we can calculate the average speed:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies separately and then add them together.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires is 8 * $800 = $6400.

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left. 

The value of the 3 sapphires she traded is 3 * $800 = $2400. 

She now has 2 rubies. Each ruby is worth $1200, so the total value of her rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is the value of the sapphires she has left plus the value of the rubies: $6400 + $2400 = $8800.

$8800"
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day, so together they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, we multiply 8 apples per day by 30 days: 8 * 30 = 240 apples.

"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost will be 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of green cards, we need to calculate 60% of the red cards and add it to the number of red cards. 

60% of 15 is 0.6 * 15 = 9. 
So, the number of green cards is 15 + 9 = 24.

The number of yellow cards is the sum of red and green cards, which is 15 + 24 = 39.

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards: 15 + 24 + 39 = 78.

"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has and the number of puppies Brandon's dog has. 

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. 
Total puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies that have spots. 
Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 
Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we need to find the percentage of puppies that have spots out of the total number of puppies. 
Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total puppies with spots / Total puppies) * 100
= (7 / 20) * 100

"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the weight of each type of feed and add them together.

The weight of sugar cubes is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.
The weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.
The weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.
The weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck to find the number of trips.

3400 / 2250 = 1.511 (round up to 2 trips since you can't make a fraction of a trip)

"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total amount she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week. Since an aluminum can is worth 2 cents, she earns 3 * 2 = 6 cents from aluminum cans per week. 

In a four-week month, she earns 6 * 4 = 24 cents from aluminum cans.

Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week. Since a plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, she earns 5 * 3 = 15 cents from plastic bottles per week.

In a four-week month, she earns 15 * 4 = 60 cents from plastic bottles.

To find the total amount Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we add the amount she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles: 24 + 60 = 84 cents.

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, so:

"Let's break down the problem. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is x. 

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be written as an equation: 

Cookies = (1/2)x + 2

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. So, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet

There are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. 

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / length of shark) * 100

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128"".

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 536"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 536"" / 12 = 44.67 feet.

The final answer is: 44.67"
"To find the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she walked in a day and then multiply it by the number of days she worked.

Charisma walks 5 minutes every hour, and she works 8 hours a day. So, the total number of minutes she walks in a day is 5 minutes/hour * 8 hours = 40 minutes/day.

Since she worked for 5 days, the total number of minutes she walked is 40 minutes/day * 5 days = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Brett is 14 years old now. In four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

In four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is 14 now, three times that is 3 * 14 = 42.

So, in four years, Angela will be 42 years old.

To find Angela's current age, we need to subtract 4 from 42, because we know her age in four years. 

Angela's current age is 42 - 4 = 38 years old.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is 14 days * $6 per day = $84.

The cost of the afternoon rides is 14 days * $2 per day = $28.

The total cost is $84 + $28 = $112.

The final answer is: $112"
"Let's break down the information given:

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley has 5 x 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

One Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, so to find out how many pies they can make, we need to divide the total number of oranges by 3.

120 / 3 = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

For the first venue, the total cost is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost). 

For the second venue, the total cost is $25x (per person charge).

To find the number of guests where the two venues are equal in cost, we set the two equations equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the number of insects David found as D, the number of insects Bodhi found as B, and the number of insects Lily found as L.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write an equation: L = D + 7.

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write another equation: D = B/2.

We are also given that together they collected 43 insects, so the sum of the insects they found is L + D + B = 43.

Now we can substitute the first equation into the third equation: (D + 7) + D + B = 43.

Combine like terms: 2D + B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2D + B = 36.

Now substitute the second equation into this one: 2(D) + B = 36 becomes 2(B/2) + B = 36.

Simplify the equation: B + B = 36.

Combine like terms: 2B = 36.

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18.

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find out how many David found: D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9.

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find out how many Lily found: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. So, the yards used by Mariah are:
1/4 * 364 = 91 yards

Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. So, the yards used by her grandma are:
1/2 * 364 = 182 yards

Now, let's add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together:
91 + 182 = 273 yards

The final answer is: 273"
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the number of gifts for her friends and add the 10 random gifts.

2 friends want 5 gifts each, so the total number of gifts for these friends is 2 x 5 = 10.

3 friends want 2 gifts each, so the total number of gifts for these friends is 3 x 2 = 6.

The total number of gifts for all friends is 10 + 6 = 16.

Adding the 10 random gifts, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is 16 + 10 = 26.

"To find the length of the couch, we first need to find the width of the rug. 

The chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. 
So, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. 
Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. 
Adding 2 feet to that makes the couch 16 + 2 = 18 feet long.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.
- 2 packs are strawberry gum.
- 1 pack is grape gum, which costs $2.
- 1 pack is green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum, so it costs $2 / 2 = $1.
- The total cost of all the gum is $7.

We know that the total cost of the 3 non-strawberry packs is $2 (grape) + $1 (green apple) = $3. 

Since the total cost of all the gum is $7, the cost of the 2 strawberry packs is $7 - $3 = $4.

To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we divide the total cost of the strawberry packs by 2: $4 / 2 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar and then calculate how many of that type of wood he can buy with his budget.

A 2 x 4 gives 200 sticks and costs $4, so the cost per stick is $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick.
A 2 x 8 gives 400 sticks and costs $6, so the cost per stick is $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick.

Since a 2 x 8 gives more sticks per dollar, we will calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with his budget.

Frederick has $24, so he can buy $24 / $6 = 4 2 x 8 pieces of wood.

Each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks, so 4 pieces will give 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost, we first need to determine the total number of snowshoes Mario needs to buy. Since each dog has 4 legs and he has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24. Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes needed is 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair. The cost per pair is $12.00, so the total cost is 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To find out how much Janet spends on bus trips in a week, we need to multiply the cost of one bus trip by the number of trips she takes in a week. 

Cost of one bus trip: $2.20
Number of trips in a week: 5

Total weekly cost of bus trips: $2.20 * 5 = $11.00

Now, we need to find out how much she would save by buying a weekly bus pass for $20. 

Weekly bus pass cost: $20
Weekly bus trip cost: $11.00

Amount saved: $20 - $11.00 = $9.00

The final answer is: $9.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The farm has 30 cows.
- The zoo has 20 sheep.
- The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
- The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Total animals in the farm and the zoo: 40 + 80 = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'. We know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, so Rose bought 4x onions and 4y potatoes.

We are given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. This can be represented as:

4x = 12 (onions)
4y = 4 (potatoes)

To find the values of x and y, we can solve these equations:

For onions: 4x = 12
x = 12 / 4
x = 3

For potatoes: 4y = 4
y = 4 / 4
y = 1

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. 

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 3 + 1 = 4."
"To find the number of days Andy has to lose the weight, we need to calculate the difference between his birthday and today. 

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to January 1st is 1 day. 
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. 
February has 28 days (since it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. 
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. 
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days. 
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days. 
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days. 
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Adding these up, Andy has 160 days to lose the weight.

To find the total calories he needs to burn, we multiply the weight he wants to lose (30 lbs) by the calories burned per pound (3500 calories). 
30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories by the number of days. 
105,000 calories / 160 days = 656.25 calories per day

The final answer is: 656.25"
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate how much he earned in a week and then subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald earns $30 per day. There are 7 days in a week, so he earns 30 * 7 = $210 in a week.

Gerald spent $100, so to find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from the amount he earned: 210 - 100 = $110.

"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total distance she will run. 

Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, we multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap: 
8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Now, we know Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. To find out how many milliliters she needs to drink for 2 km, we multiply the distance by the amount of water per kilometer:
2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

First, Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes. 
20% of $500 = 0.2 * $500 = $100

Now, Julie has $500 - $100 = $400 left.

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining money on CDs. 
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, Julie has $400 - $100 = $300 left.

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we can find the cost of the house by multiplying x by 3: 3 * 30,000 = 90,000

The cost of the house is $90,000."
"To find the profit, we need to first find the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the canvas bags, which is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack * $4 per bag = 8 * 5 * 4 = $160.

The total revenue is the selling price of the bags, which is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $64 - $160 = -$96. However, since profit cannot be negative, it seems there is an error in the problem. 

However, if we assume that the problem is asking for the profit per bag, then the profit per bag is ($8 - $4) = $4 per bag. The total profit would be 8 bags * $4 per bag = $32.

If we assume that the problem is asking for the profit, then the answer is $32."
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total number of minutes in the fight and multiply it by the average number of punches he throws per minute.

There are 5 rounds, each lasting 3 minutes. So, the total number of minutes is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, the total number of punches he threw is 15 * 25 = 375 punches.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. 
   Total money = (4 * $10) + (6 * $20) = $40 + $120 = $160

2. Ali gives his sister half of the total money. 
   Half of the total money = $160 / 2 = $80
   Money left after giving his sister half = $160 - $80 = $80

3. Now, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. 
   3/5 of the remaining money = (3/5) * $80 = $48
   Money left after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.

To find the number of rows of blue tulips, we need to divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

24 blue tulips / 8 tulips per row = 3 rows of blue tulips

Since Jackson can plant both red and blue tulips in the same row, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of rows of red and blue tulips to determine the total number of rows. 

The LCM of 6 and 3 is 6.

Therefore, Jackson will plant 6 rows of flowers."
"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to first determine how many cups of raisins she has available for the cookies. 

Since she divides the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each will get 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. 

To find out how many batches she can make, we need to divide 9 by 3/4. To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal. 

9 / (3/4) = 9 * (4/3) = 12

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption is 12 * 24 = 288 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day. 

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. Her daily consumption will be 14 * 24 = 336 kWh per day.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. 

Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly consumption is 288 * 7 = 2016 kWh. 

After adding the new device, her weekly consumption is 336 * 7 = 2352 kWh.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kWh. 

Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly bill is 2016 * $1.50 = $3024.

After adding the new device, Ada's weekly bill is 2352 * $1.50 = $3528.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $3528 - $3024 = $504.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house. 

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then 5 people can paint half a house in 5 / 5 = 1 day. 

Since 5 people can paint half a house in 1 day, they can paint a whole house in 2 days (because 2 * 0.5 = 1).

Now, we need to convert the number of days into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 2 days is equal to 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.
5. To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have: 20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 64 (Jenna's sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 152.

"Let's break down the information given. Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set for an unknown price. The total cost was $48. 

Let's denote the price of the headphone set as 'x'. We can set up the equation:

4 + x = 48

To find the price of the headphone set, we need to subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

x = 48 - 4
x = 44

So, the price of the headphone set is $44.

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he had not bought the headphone set. He had $48 left after buying the CD, and each CD costs $4. 

Number of CDs = Total money / Price of one CD
= 48 / 4
= 12

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he had not bought the headphone set. He would have had $44 left after buying the CD, and each CD costs $4.

Number of CDs = Total money / Price of one CD
= 44 / 4
= 11

To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we need to subtract the number of CDs he bought with the headphone set from the number of CDs he could have bought without the headphone set:

Number of additional CDs = 12 - 1

6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

For the weeks where he spent 5 hours, there are 2 weeks.
2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

For the week where he spent 6 hours, there is 1 week.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of people left on the bus is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus, so 5 * 8 = 40 people get in. The total number of people on the bus now is:
40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of people left on the bus is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 3 times 21 is 63, but since it's 3 times fewer, we subtract 63 from 21 to get the number of people who got in, which is 21 - 63 = -42. However, since you can't have a negative number of people, this means that 63 is the number of people who got off, and 21 is the number of people who got in. So the correct calculation is:
59 - 63 = -4 (people left after 63 got off) 
59 - 63 = -4 (initially incorrect, but we know 21 got in)

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.
   Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years.
   So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.
3. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.
4. The difference in their current ages is 47 - 22 = 25 years.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
2. The computer costs $1,100.
3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer.

First, let's find the cost of the printer. Since the printer costs $400 less than the computer, and the computer costs $1,100, the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's find the total cost of the computer and the printer. The computer costs $1,100 and the printer costs $700, so together they cost $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.

Since the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400, and the computer and printer together cost $1,800, the cost of the 2 monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

Since there are 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is $600 / 2 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we first need to find out how many seashells the girls brought in total. 

Since there are 20 kids in total and they were divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls. 

The boys brought 60 shells each, so the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 60 shells.

First, we calculate 4 * 60 = 240. 

Then, we add 600 + 240 = 840.

So, the total number of shells brought by the girls is 840.

Since there are 10 girls, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by 10 to find out how many shells each girl brought: 840 / 10 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, let's assume George had x candies. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2x candies.

Then, George ate 5 candies, so George now has x - 5 candies.

We are given that George now has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation:

x - 5 = 3

To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 3 + 5
x = 8

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find out how many candies Nick had:

Nick had 2x candies, so Nick had 2(8) = 16 candies.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Anne's age, we need to first find Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6 years.

Then, to find Anne's age, we need to add 2 years to Alyana's age. So, Anne's age is 6 + 2 = 8 years.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188

The final answer is: 188"
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she aims to make.

Emma made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

Total vlogs made so far = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Total vlogs Emma aims to make = 72

Vlogs needed to complete the month = Total vlogs aimed - Total vlogs made so far
= 72 - 54
= 18

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total amount you paid, first, calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill. 

20% of $50 is 0.20 * $50 = $10.

Then, add the tip to the original bill: $50 + $10 = $60.

Since your wife wants to split the check evenly, you will pay half of the total amount: $60 / 2 = $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The eldest boy's initial share is $18 / 3 = $6.
2. He added $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11.
3. He added another $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.
4. He spent $8, so he now has $21 - $8 = $13.
5. He tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8, so he now has $13 * 3 = $39.

The final answer is: $39"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of April is x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half of April is 30 - x.

Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. If he saves y dollars in the first half, he will save 2y dollars in the second half.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first and second half, which is equal to the target of $1125. 

So, we can write the equation: x * y + (30 - x) * 2y = 1125

We can simplify the equation by distributing the 2: xy + 60y - 2xy = 1125

Combine like terms: -xy + 60y = 1125

Factor out y: y(-x + 60) = 1125

Divide both sides by (-x + 60): y = 1125 / (-x + 60)

Since we don't know the value of x, we need to find a way to express y in terms of x. However, we can use the fact that the total number of days in April is 30. 

The number of days in the first half of April is x, and the number of days in the second half of April is 30 - x. The sum of these two is equal to 30: x + (30 - x) = 30

Simplify the equation: 30 = 30

This equation is true for any value of x, but we can use it to find the value of x that makes the savings in the first half equal to the savings in the second half. 

If the savings in the first half is y, the savings in the second half is 2y. The total savings is 3y, which is equal to 1125.

3y = 1125

Divide both sides by 3: y = 375

Now that we know the savings in the first half, we can find the number of days in the first half. The savings in the first half is y, which is $375. 

Let's assume the number of days in the first half is x. Then, the savings per day in the first half is 375 / x.

The savings in the second half is 2y, which is 2 * 375 = 750. The number of days in the second half is 30 - x.

The savings per day in the second half is 750 / (30 - x).

Since the savings per day in the second half is twice the savings per day in the first half, we can set up the equation:

750 / (30 - x) = 2 * (375 / x)

Multiply both sides by (30 - x) * x to eliminate the fractions:

750x = 2 * 375 * (30 - x)

Distribute the 2:

750x = 22500 - 750x

Add 750x to both sides:

1500x = 22500

Divide both sides by 1500:

x = 15

Now that we know the number of days in the first half, we can find the savings per day in the second half. The number of days in the second half is 30 - x, which is 30 - 15 = 15.

The savings in the second half is 750, and the number of days is 15. 

The savings per day in the second half is 750 / 15 = 50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the total cost of the fruits, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of three apples at $1.50 each is 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of five oranges at $0.80 each is 5 x $0.80 = $4.
The cost of six peaches at $0.75 each is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them gets and then find the difference.

Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, and he finished 20 tasks. So, Jairus's total earnings = 0.8 * 20 = $16.

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, and she finished 20 tasks. So, Jenny's total earnings = 0.5 * 20 = $10.

Now, let's find the difference between Jairus's and Jenny's earnings: $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"Let's denote the amount Brad gets as B. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff's amount can be represented as 4B.

We know that the total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars. So, the sum of the amounts they get should be equal to 100. 

B + 4B = 100

Combine like terms:
5B = 100

Divide both sides by 5:
B = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff's amount is 4B:
Jeff's amount = 4 * 20 = 80

The final answer is: $80"
"To find out how many miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total distance he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works.

Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles.

Now, we multiply the daily distance by the number of days he works: 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice: 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters
2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once: 26 / 2 = 13 letters
3. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written: 52 + 13 = 65 letters

Now, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 65 letters. So, the total number of letters she has written is: 65 + 65 = 130

The final answer is: 130"
"This is a classic example of exponential growth. Let's break it down step by step:

1. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
2. In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so there are 3 x 3 = 9 new families notified.
   Total families notified so far: 3 (initial) + 9 (new) = 12
3. In the third round, each of the 12 families calls 3 other families, so there are 12 x 3 = 36 new families notified.
   Total families notified so far: 12 (previous) + 36 (new) = 48
4. In the fourth round, each of the 48 families calls 3 other families, so there are 48 x 3 = 144 new families notified.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight he lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Now, we add the weight he lost to his final weight to find his initial weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

Now, we know that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have a total of 400 toys. Let's call the number of toys Jonathan currently has ""x"". We can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 400

To solve for x, we need to isolate x by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

Cost of 5 notebooks: 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
Cost of 2 pens: 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
Cost of 1 calculator: $12
Cost of 1 geometry set: $10
Total cost before discount: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

Now, we need to apply the 10% discount:
Discount = 10% of $30 = 0.1 * $30 = $3
Total cost after discount: $30 - $3 = $27

The final answer is: $27"
"To find out how much change Carly gets back, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she ordered and subtract that from the $50 bill.

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to calculate the commission for the first $1000 and the additional commission for the sales over $1000.

Commission for the first $1000: 30% of $1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = $300

Commission for the sales over $1000: $2500 - $1000 = $1500
Additional commission for the sales over $1000: 10% of $1500 = 0.1 * 1500 = $150

Total commission: $300 + $150 = $450

So, Antonella earned $450."
"To find out how many bottles Bill already has, we need to multiply the number of cases by the number of bottles in each case. 

2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

Since Bill wants 2 bottles for each of his 70 guests, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of bottles per guest.

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

To find out how many more bottles Bill needs, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs.

140 bottles - 48 bottles = 92 bottles

The final answer is: 92"
"Let's break down the information given:

- When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
- When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as it takes him to swim a mile in cold water.

First, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. 

Twice the time it takes to swim a mile in cold water is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes.
2 minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold water and in warm water.

In cold water, it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile. So, to swim 3 miles, it will take him 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

In warm water, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile. So, to swim 3 miles, it will take him 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

Now, let's find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and in cold water.

The difference is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"Let's break down the information given:

Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. 
Since we don't know the daily recommended cups, let's call it 'x'. 
So, Octavia drinks x/2 cups.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, which is 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. 
So, Juan needs to reduce his current intake of 5x cups to 4 cups.

To find out how many cups Juan needs to reduce, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake: 
5x - 4.

However, we still don't know the value of 'x'. To find it, we need to know the daily recommended cups of coffee. Since the question doesn't provide this information, let's assume the daily recommended cups of coffee is 2 (this is a common recommendation). 

If the daily recommended cups of coffee is 2, then x = 2. 
Now, we can find out how many cups Juan needs to reduce: 
5x - 4 = 5(2) - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 cups.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total number of rodents, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

The pet shop has 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is 3 * 10 = 30.

The pet shop has 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is 3 * 5 = 15.

"To find the average weight of the 3 friends, we need to first find their individual weights.

Mark weighs 150 pounds.
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total weight of the 3 friends and divide it by 3 to get the average weight.
Total weight = Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight
Total weight = 150 + 130 + 260
Total weight = 540

Average weight = Total weight / 3
Average weight = 540 / 3
Average weight = 180

"To find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy, we need to determine the total number of candles he needs. Since one son is 12 and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Typically, birthday candles are one per year of age, so James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed by the number of candles per pack: 20 / 5 = 4.

Since James needs 4 packs of candles and each pack costs $3, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 4 * 3 = 12.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week and then convert that to pages. 

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we need to find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which is 105 / 1.5 = 70.

Now that we know there are 70 intervals of 1.5 minutes, and she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we multiply 70 by 2 to find the total pages she read in the first week. 70 * 2 = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we add the pages she read in the first week to the pages she read in the second week. 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

In 7 years, the nephew's age will be x + 7.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can set up the equation:

51 = 3(x + 7)

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we'll divide both sides by 3:

17 = x + 7

Next, we'll subtract 7 from both sides:

10 = x

So, the nephew is 10 years old today.

"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how many he bought each day and add them up.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day on wooden action figures. Since he spent 5 days, he spent a total of 5 * $5 = $25 on wooden action figures.

He has $70 initially, so after spending $25, he has $70 - $25 = $45 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), Peter will spend $2 each day on plastic action figures. Since there are 4 days left, he will spend a total of 4 * $2 = $8 on plastic action figures.

After buying plastic action figures, he will have $45 - $8 = $37 left.

Now, let's calculate the total number of action figures he bought. From Sunday to Wednesday, he bought 25 / $5 = 5 wooden action figures. From Thursday to Saturday, he bought 8 / $2 = 4 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter bought 5 + 4 = 9 action figures.

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 - 160 = 100.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 x 12 = 24 months.

Katina removes $100 from the account every month, so in 24 months, she will remove 24 x $100 = $2400.

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her account.

The final answer is: $600"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. So, the cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30 per sandwich.

The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00. So, the cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00 per sandwich.

The total cost per sandwich is $0.30 (bread) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $3.30 per sandwich.

The revenue per sandwich is $7.00.

The net profit per sandwich is $7.00 (revenue) - $3.30 (cost) = $3.70 per sandwich.

Since they sell 10 sandwiches, the total revenue is $7.00 x 10 = $70.00.

The total cost for 10 sandwiches is $3.30 x 10 = $33.00.

The net profit is $70.00 (total revenue) - $33.00 (total cost) = $37.00.

"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to first find out how many muffin crayons she can make. 

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together in each muffin tin, and there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we need to find out how many small pieces of crayons there are in total. 

There are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, so there are 3 * 64 = 192 small pieces of crayons.

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together in each muffin tin, we need to divide the total number of small pieces of crayons by 8 to find out how many muffin crayons she can make. 

192 / 8 = 24 muffin crayons.

Now that we know Kate can make 24 muffin crayons, we can multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price of each muffin crayon to find out how much money Kate can make. 

24 * $1.50 = $36.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost for the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost for removal is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost for installation is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost is the sum of the costs for the carpet, padding, removal, and installation: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11332.

"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to find the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference is 468 - 450 = 18.
The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4%, we need to find the temperature that is 4% less than 520.

First, we find 4% of 520: 0.04 * 520 = 20.8.

Then, we subtract 20.8 from 520 to find the temperature Maggie should set: 520 - 20.8 = 499.2.

"To find out how many pairs of contacts Pete will need, we need to multiply the number of days he needs contacts by the number of pairs he uses per day. 

Pete needs contacts for 45 days and uses 1 pair per day, so he needs 45 pairs of contacts. 

Since he buys 2 boxes, he will have a total of 90 pairs of contacts (2 boxes * 45 pairs per box).

The discount is 10% off the original price of $100.00 per box. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $100.00 * 0.10 = $10.00.

The discounted price per box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.

To find the total cost of 2 boxes, we multiply the discounted price by 2: $90.00 * 2 = $180.00.

To find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs: $180.00 / 90 pairs = $2.00 per pair.

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. 

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans) and G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans).

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3.01B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3.01:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485

And the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he'll lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts every day for breakfast, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he'll gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.5}$"
"To find the total number of people attending, we need to break down the information given:

1. Alex invites 100 people via email, and each of them invites 2 friends. So, the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

2. Alex then calls 10 friends and 8 of them say they will bring their spouses. This means 8 couples will be attending, which is 8 * 2 = 16 people. So, the total number of people Alex's friends are bringing is 10 + 16 = 26.

3. To find the total number of people attending, we add the people invited via email and the people Alex's friends are bringing: 300 + 26 = 326.

However, we also need to include Alex herself, so the total number of people attending is 326 + 1 = 327.

The final answer is: 327"
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to find the weight of the Papillon first, then multiply it by 44.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find the total cost of the boots on Amazon, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. 

Amazon cost: $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20

On eBay, the shipping cost is twice as much as on Amazon, so the shipping cost is $4 * 2 = $8.

eBay cost: $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping) = $21

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to subtract the Amazon cost from the eBay cost.

Difference: $21 (eBay) - $20 (Amazon) = $1

The boots work out to be $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to reach or exceed 20 feet. 

Since the beanstalk doubles in height every day and starts at 4 feet, we can calculate its height for each day:

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 8 feet
Day 3: 16 feet
Day 4: 32 feet

As we can see, on the 4th day, the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet off the ground.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Jerry's current age be x.

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can write an equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So Jerry's current age is 10.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown, and then subtract the deposit he has already paid.

The base price of each implant is $2000, and he needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

He wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

He has already paid a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

To find out how many hours he needs to work to pay for the dental work, we need to divide the remaining amount he needs to pay by his hourly wage. His hourly wage is $15, so the number of hours he needs to work is $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it would be 2x. 
And since one angle is three times the smallest angle, it would be 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. 
One angle is 2x, which is 2 * 30 = 60 degrees. 
The other angle is 3x, which is 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

8 quarters = 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
6 dimes = 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

Total amount of money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball
= 345 cents / 5 cents
= 69

"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds and add it to 8 pounds.

50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds.

Adding 4 pounds to 8 pounds gives us 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

Since Jamaal then uses a weight two pounds lighter than 12 pounds, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, which is 12 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 12 = 22 games at the end of the first year.

In the second year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, which is 24 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 24 = 34 games at the end of the second year.

In the third year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 48 = 58 games at the end of the third year.

Now, let's add up the total number of games Steve has at the end of the third year: 22 (from the first year) + 34 (from the second year) + 58 (from the third year) = 114 games.

"To find the rate of the plane, we need to divide the distance it traveled by the time it took. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it would take the plane 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to first find out how many pounds Ruiz makes in an hour. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how many pounds he makes in an hour, we divide 120 by 2. 

120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour for Ruiz.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour. To find out how many pounds Marissa makes in an hour, we multiply 60 by 3/4.

60 * (3/4) = 45 pounds per hour for Marissa.

Now that we know how many pounds each person makes in an hour, we can find out how many pounds they make in 12 hours. 

Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.

Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

To find the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together, we add the pounds made by Ruiz and Marissa. 

720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: 1260"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

On Monday, Howard spends $8 at the arcade. 
On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as Monday, so he spends 2 * $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spends 4 * $16 = $64.

To find out how much he spent in total, we add the amounts spent on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

Since Howard originally had $100, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount to find out how much he has left: $100 - $88 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the total number of cups sold and the total amount earned from each period, then add them together.

For the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
Total cups sold in the first four hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups
Total amount earned in the first four hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

For the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
Total cups sold in the next two hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups
Total amount earned in the next two hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

Total amount earned in 6 hours = Total amount earned in the first four hours + Total amount earned in the next two hours
Total amount earned in 6 hours = $30 + $12
Total amount earned in 6 hours = $42

"To find out how many times the tires rotate in a month, we need to multiply the number of miles driven per month by the number of rotations per mile. 

Rotations per month = 400 miles/month * 725 rotations/mile = 290,000 rotations/month

Now, we need to find out how many months the tires can last before they need to be replaced. 

Total rotations allowed = 10,440,000 rotations
Rotations per month = 290,000 rotations/month

Months before replacement = Total rotations allowed / Rotations per month
Months before replacement = 10,440,000 / 290,000
Months before replacement = 36

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find the number of years by dividing the total months by 12.

Years before replacement = Months before replacement / 12
Years before replacement = 36 / 12
Years before replacement = 3

"To find out how much Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there's a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3). The discount amount is $60 * 0.3 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost: $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to calculate it separately. The final cost is $42.

Now, we subtract the final cost from the initial amount of money Joe has: $50 - $42 = $8.

"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7:

4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Since there are 12 croissants in a dozen, we multiply 28 dozen by 12:

28 dozen * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants

Now, we know it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how much butter is needed for 336 croissants, we multiply 336 by 1/4:

336 croissants * (1/4 pound/croissant) = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

Next, we need to find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we can calculate this as 60% of 25, which is 0.6 * 25 = 15 women.

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright: 25 - 15 = 10 men.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to find the price of the gold and silver jewels first.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, so we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
- He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.
- He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps together: 
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for the distance between them to decrease to zero.

First, let's find the relative speed between Tom and Bob. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract their speeds: 70 mph (Tom) - 55 mph (Bob) = 15 mph.

Now, we know that the initial distance between them is 75 miles. To find the time it takes for Tom to catch up, we can use the formula: time = distance / relative speed.

time = 75 miles / 15 mph
time = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's assume Manny misses x classes. Since there are 10 total classes, he will attend 10 - x classes.

The total cost of the classes he attends is $60, and the cost per class is $10. So, the total cost of the classes he attends is 10 * 10 = $100. However, the total cost of the classes he attends is also 10 - x * 10.

Since the total cost of the classes he attends is $60, we can set up the equation:

(10 - x) * 10 = 60

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10:

10 - x = 6

Now, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

-x = -4

Multiplying both sides of the equation by -1:

x = 4

So, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and she works all 7 days of the week, her total weekly production is 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, she processes twice the number of customers Jewel does in a day. So, Julie's daily production is 2 * 50 = 100 customers.

Now, we need to find Julie's total weekly production. Since she also works all 7 days of the week, her total weekly production is 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for both Jewel and Julie is the sum of their individual weekly productions, which is 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

"To find the cost of 5 apples, we need to first find the cost of one apple. 

Cost of 4 apples = $5.20
Cost of 1 apple = $5.20 / 4 = $1.30

Now, we can find the cost of 5 apples.
Cost of 5 apples = $1.30 * 5 = $6.50

To find the cost of 5 oranges, we need to first find the cost of one orange.

Cost of 3 oranges = $3.30
Cost of 1 orange = $3.30 / 3 = $1.10

Now, we can find the cost of 5 oranges.
Cost of 5 oranges = $1.10 * 5 = $5.50

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges.
Total cost = Cost of 5 apples + Cost of 5 oranges
Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50
Total cost = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To find out how much Tim will make in a year, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary:
5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Next, let's calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary:
Bonus = $20,000 / 2 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly income:
Total monthly income = New monthly salary + Bonus = $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

Finally, let's calculate the total annual income:
Total annual income = Total monthly income * 12 = $31,000 * 12 = $372,000

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then subtract the two amounts.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got $2 off because she had a voucher. So, the total cost of the pomegranates on the first day is:

20 pomegranates * $20 per pomegranate = $400
$400 - $2 (voucher) = $398

On the second day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, but the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the total cost of the pomegranates on the second day is:

20 pomegranates * $30 per pomegranate = $600
10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
$600 - $60 (discount) = $540

Now, we can find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:

$540 (second day) - $398 (first day) = $142

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first month, Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Let's call the total sales from green hats in the first month 'x'. Then, the sales from red hats in the first month is $400, which is half of 'x', so we can write an equation:

400 = x/2

To find the value of 'x', we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 400 * 2
x = 800

So, the total sales from green hats in the first month is $800.

Now, we know that the total sales in the first month is the sum of sales from red and green hats:

Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
= $400 + $800
= $1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month is:

Sales in the second month = 3/4 * Total sales in the first month
= 3/4 * $1200
= $900

Now, we need to find the total sales in two months. We add the sales of the first and second months:

Total sales in two months = Sales in the first month + Sales in the second month
= $1200 + $900
= $2100

The final answer is: $2100"

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves make up a dozen eggs. 

1 dozen eggs = 12 eggs
1 dozen eggs = 2 * 6 deviled egg halves (since 1 egg makes 2 deviled egg halves)
1 dozen eggs = 12 deviled egg halves

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, so we can set up the following equation: 
S + G = 20

We can solve the second equation for G: 
G = 20 - S

Now, substitute G in the first equation: 
4S + 2(20 - S) = 70

Expand the equation: 
4S + 40 - 2S = 70

Combine like terms:

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find the value of 'x':

18 / 2 = 2x / 2
9 = x

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the current height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we need to find the difference between the target height and the current height:

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. 
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs 8 more toys.
   Total toys needed so far: 4 (initial toys) + 8 (additional toys) = 12 toys
3. When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs.
   Total dogs now: 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (initial additional dogs) + 16 (new dogs) = 28 dogs
   Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 28 more toys.
   Total toys needed so far: 12 (previous toys) + 28 (new toys) = 40 toys
4. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys.
   Total toys needed: 40 (previous toys) - 3 (unnecessary toys) = 37 toys

The final answer is: 37"
"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow the sequence of investments.

Initially, the total amount invested is $1200.

Dylan's investment is 2/5 of the total amount:
Dylan's investment = (2/5) * 1200 = 480

The remaining amount after Dylan's investment is:
Remaining amount = 1200 - 480 = 720

Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount:
Frances' investment = (2/3) * 720 = 480

The remaining amount after Frances' investment is:
Remaining amount = 720 - 480 = 240

Skyler's investment is the remaining amount:
Skyler's investment = 240

The final answer is: $240"
"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we first need to determine how many signatures they currently have. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 

Total signatures currently collected = 20 (Carol's signatures) + 44 (Jennifer's signatures) = 64 signatures.

Since they want to reach 100 signatures by the end of the summer, we need to find out how many more signatures they need to collect.

Signatures needed = Total signatures desired - Total signatures currently collected
= 100 - 64
= 36

So, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to find out how much she earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Karen works in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, in two days she works 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can find out how much Karen earns in two days by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works: $20 * 6 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a ratio of potatoes to hash browns as follows: 

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns

To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we can set up a proportion:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

6x = 96 * 36

6x = 3456

Now, we can divide both sides by 6 to find x:

x = 3456 / 6

x = 576

So, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

576"
"To find out how much the group will exceed the maximum load, we need to calculate the total weight of the 9 adults and subtract the maximum load of the elevator.

The total weight of the 9 adults is 9 adults * 80 kg/adult = 720 kg.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, but we don't know how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. However, we can express the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as x. So, Max has x + 12 cookies.
4. Since Max has 73 cookies, we can set up the equation x + 12 = 73 to find the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
5. Solving the equation, we get x = 73 - 12 = 61 cookies for the Cookie Monster.
6. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.
7. To find the total number of cookies, we add the number of cookies each person has: 68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = 298.

The final answer is: 298"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let the original length of the dress be x cm. 

Since Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, the new length after extension is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, she adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress, so the final length is 1.5x + 20.

We are given that the final design is 140cm long, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Next, divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 120 / 1.5
x = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took for each mode and then add them together.

First, let's find the time it took for each mode in minutes. 
- Turtle mode: 1 hour = 60 minutes
- Rabbit mode: 40 minutes

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode, we need to multiply the time for each mode by 0.5 (half).
- Turtle mode: 60 minutes * 0.5 = 30 minutes
- Rabbit mode: 40 minutes * 0.5 = 20 minutes

Now, we add the time for each mode together to get the total time.
Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time it takes to get to the fire station from the total time they have. 

Total time they have = 30 minutes
Time to get to the fire station = 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Time left to get to school = Total time they have - Time to get to the fire station
Time left to get to school = 30 minutes - 19 minutes
Time left to get to school = 11 minutes

"To find out how many cookies are in the box, we first need to determine the total number of cookies baked by Greta and Celinda. 

Greta bakes 30 cookies. 
Celinda bakes twice as many as Greta, so she bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies is 30 (Greta's cookies) + 60 (Celinda's cookies) = 90 cookies.

They eat 10 cookies, so the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. 

Since there are two twins and one triplet, the total age is 2T + t. We are given that their combined ages are 44, so we can write the equation:

2T + t = 44

We also know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write another equation:

T = t + 7

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one:

2(t + 7) + t = 44

Expanding the equation:

2t + 14 + t = 44

Combine like terms:

3t + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides:

3t = 30

Divide both sides by 3:

t = 10

Now that we know the age of the triplet, we can find the age of the older twin:

T = t + 7
T = 10 + 7
T = 17

First, let's convert 3 hours to minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time John spends on homework: 
20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

Now, let's subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner: 
180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes.

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

The total cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2. 

The total cost of 4 candies is $3.20. 

To find the cost of one candy, we divide the total cost of candies by the number of candies: $3.20 / 4 = $0.80 per candy.

Now, we can find the total cost of 10 lollipops: 10 * $0.40 = $4.

The total cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.80 = $8.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4 + $8 = $12.

"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year) and 10 (the number of years).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year: 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year: 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings: 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings: 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

Now, let's add their total savings to find out how many coins they have in total after 10 years:

"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, but we don't know the total bill yet. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check is $40 + $60 = $100.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

"To find the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits in it. 

First, let's find the cost of one banana. Since one banana costs twice as much as an apple, and one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Next, let's find the cost of one orange. Since one orange costs three times as much as a banana, and one banana costs $1, one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits in one crate. 
- 5 bananas cost 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples cost 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges cost 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the fruits in one crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The price for such a crate of fruit is $32."
"To find the total number of squares, we need to calculate the number of each color and add them together.

The comforter has 14 red squares.

There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.

There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.

There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, we add the number of squares of each color together: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

The total number of squares is 68, and since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"To find out how many regular chairs the restaurant has, we need to multiply the number of high chairs by 5. 

Number of high chairs: 8
Number of regular chairs = 5 * 8 = 40

Total number of chairs needed for adults and babies: 42 (adults) + 15 (babies) = 57

Since the babies will be seated in high chairs, we only need to consider the adults for regular chairs. 
Number of regular chairs needed for adults: 42

Number of regular chairs available: 40
Number of regular chairs needed: 42

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the available chairs from the needed chairs: 
40 - 42 = -2

However, since we can't have a negative number of chairs, this means Mia needs to get 2 more regular chairs to accommodate all the adults."

2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
   To find Betty's points, we need to calculate 30% of Adam's points and add it to Adam's points.
   30% of 50 = 0.3 * 50 = 15
   Betty's points = Adam's points + 15 = 50 + 15 = 65
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   Tom's points = Betty's points - 30 = 65 - 30 = 35
4. Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   Marta's points = 3 * Tom's points = 3 * 35 = 105

Now, let's add up the points of all the students:
Adam's points + Betty's points + Tom's points + Marta's points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold:

However, this is not the final answer yet. Each of Great Grandma Jones' children also has 3 children of their own, and each of these children has 3 great grand-babies. So, we need to multiply the number of great grand-babies by the number of children each of Great Grandma Jones' children has, which is 3.

So, 9 great grand-babies * 3 children per child = 27 great grand-babies.

But we're not done yet. Each of Great Grandma Jones' children also has 3 children of their own, and each of these children has 3 great grand-babies. So, we need to multiply the number of great grand-babies by the number of children each of Great Grandma Jones' children has, which is 3.

So, 27 great grand-babies * 3 children per child = 81 great grand-babies.

However, this is still not the final answer. We need to multiply this by 3, because Great Grandma Jones has 3 children of her own, and each of them has 3 children of their own, and each of those children has 3 great grand-babies.

"To find out how many fireworks Hannah will see, we first need to find out how many fireworks will be set off in total. 

There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks is 15 * 20 = 300. 

Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so she will set off 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks in her backyard.

In total, the city will set off 300 + 15 = 315 fireworks.

Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks, so she will see 40% of 315. To find 40% of 315, we multiply 315 by 0.4.

First, we know that there are 8 males and 6 females, so the total number of people is 8 + 6 = 14.

Each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

The total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

The total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is 18 + 32 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten, which is 50.

"To find out how many hours they have to fundraise in total, we need to first find out how much they need to raise per hour. 

They have raised $2100 in 3 hours, so we divide $2100 by 3 to get the amount raised per hour: $2100 / 3 = $700.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise the remaining amount. They need to raise a total of $6300, and they have already raised $2100, so they need to raise $6300 - $2100 = $4200 more.

To find out how many hours it will take to raise $4200, we divide $4200 by the amount raised per hour, which is $700: $4200 / $700 = 6.

Since they have already raised money for 3 hours, we need to add the 6 hours it will take to raise the remaining amount to the 3 hours they have already worked: 3 + 6 = 9.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we first need to find the percentage used for industrial purposes and subtract it from the total percentage used by the city.

The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. 

First, find 80% of 40%: 
80% of 40% = 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%

This means 32% of the river's water is used by the city for industrial purposes.

Now, subtract this from the total percentage used by the city to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes:

"To find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each type of ice cream and then add them together.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find the production rate per hour, we divide 100 quarts by 2 hours:

100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour (chocolate)

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find the production rate per hour, we divide 50 quarts by 4 hours:

50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour (vanilla)

Now, we need to find the total quarts of each type of ice cream made in 48 hours:

Chocolate: 50 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla: 12.5 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the number of taps for both scenarios (with arms down and with arms up) and add them together.

With arms down, Helga taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. So, the total number of taps per minute is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute. Since she dances with her arms down for 3 minutes, the total number of taps is 550 * 3 = 1650.

With arms up, Helga taps her right foot at 200 taps per minute and her left foot at 200 taps per minute. So, the total number of taps per minute is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute. Since she dances with her arms up for 2 minutes, the total number of taps is 400 * 2 = 800.

The total number of taps is 1650 + 800 = 2450.

"To find the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends, we first need to find out how many slices they ate in total. Since there are 5 people in total (Bryce and 4 friends), and 2/3 of their pizzas were eaten, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by these 5 people as follows:

5 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 5 * 8 = 40 slices

However, this is the total number of slices eaten by 5 people, but we know that 2 of these people ate 2/3 of their pizzas, and 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas. So, we need to find out how many slices were eaten by the 3 people who ate 2/3 of their pizzas. 

3 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 3 * 8 = 24 slices

Now, we need to find out how many slices were eaten by the 2 people who ate 3/4 of their pizzas. 

2 people * 3/4 * 12 slices/person = 2 * 9 = 18 slices

Now, we can add the slices eaten by the 3 people who ate 2/3 of their pizzas and the 2 people who ate 3/4 of their pizzas to get the total number of slices eaten by all 5 people.

24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices

Since there were 5 people and each pizza had 12 slices, the total number of slices was 5 * 12 = 60 slices.

Now, we can find the number of slices left by subtracting the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices.

60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, we get 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We can represent this as an equation: 

Length of Topher's shoe = 9 * Length of Bobby's shoe + 10

Substituting the length of Topher's shoe (100 inches) into the equation, we get:

100 = 9 * Length of Bobby's shoe + 10

Now, we can solve for the length of Bobby's shoe by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

90 = 9 * Length of Bobby's shoe

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 9 to isolate the length of Bobby's shoe:

10 = Length of Bobby's shoe

"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 and subtract that from the total number of people.

At 8:00, 2/5 of 5000 people had voted by midday. 
2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by midday.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
The remaining people after midday are 5000 - 2000 = 3000.
2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people voted by 16:00.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is the total number of people minus the number of people who voted by 16:00.
5000 - (2000 + 2000) = 5000 - 4000 = 1000

"To find out how many boxes of graham crackers are needed, we first need to calculate the total number of smores required.

9 kids want 2 smores each, so the total number of smores for kids is 9 * 2 = 18.
6 adults will eat 1 s'more each, so the total number of smores for adults is 6 * 1 = 6.
The total number of smores needed is 18 (for kids) + 6 (for adults) = 24.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 smores, we need to divide the total number of smores by 8 to find out how many sleeves are needed: 24 / 8 = 3.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the total number of sleeves needed by 3 to find out how many boxes are needed: 3 / 3 = 1.

Therefore, they will need 1 box of graham crackers.

"Let's break down the information given:

- A gallon jar costs $5.
- A gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar.

Since a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar by subtracting $2 from the cost of a gallon jar:

Cost of a half-gallon jar = Cost of a gallon jar - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 10-gallon jars:

Total cost of 10-gallon jars = Number of gallon jars * Cost of a gallon jar
Total cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5
Total cost of 10-gallon jars = $50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of 16 half-gallon jars:

Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = Number of half-gallon jars * Cost of a half-gallon jar
Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $48

Now, let's add the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say the number of students in each class is x. Since there are two classes, the total number of students is 2x. We know that the total number of students is 80, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 80

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 80 / 2
x = 40

So, there are 40 students in each class.

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we can multiply the total number of students in each class by 0.4 (which is the decimal equivalent of 40%):

Number of girls in each class = 0.4 * 40
= 16

Since the total number of students in each class is 40, the number of boys in each class is:

Number of boys in each class = Total number of students in each class - Number of girls in each class

However, the problem states that the activity requires 12 groups, but we are asked to find out how many more groups are needed to form, given that 54 students are to be separated into six groups of equal size. 

So, we first need to find out how many students are in each group for the activity. 

Students per group for the activity = Total students / Groups required for the activity
Students per group for the activity = 54 / 12
Students per group for the activity = 4.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure each group has at least one student. 

Students per group for the activity = 5

Now, we need to find out how many groups are needed for 54 students, given that each group has 5 students.

Total groups needed = Total students / Students per group
Total groups needed = 54 / 5
Total groups needed = 10.8

"To find out how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to subtract the number of broken items from the total number of items he sent.

First, let's calculate the total number of glasses and plates Jeff sent:

- Glasses: 8 dozen = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
- Plates: 4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

Now, let's subtract the number of broken items:

- Broken glasses: 10
- Broken plates: 6

So, the number of glasses Jeff has now is: 96 - 10 = 86
The number of plates Jeff has now is: 48 - 6 = 42

The total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now is: 86 + 42 = 128"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. 

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading her small stickers.

Now, she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading her large stickers.

Now, she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading her large stickers.

Now, let's add up all the buttons she has: 
- 27 small buttons from trading small stickers
- 20 large buttons from trading large stickers
- 60 small buttons from trading large stickers

Since large buttons are worth three small buttons, we can convert the large buttons to small buttons: 
20 large buttons * 3 = 60 small buttons

Now, let's add up all the small buttons: 
- 27 small buttons from trading small stickers
- 60 small buttons from trading large stickers
- 60 small buttons from converting large buttons

Total small buttons = 27 + 60 + 60 = 147 small buttons

Total buttons = 147 small buttons

The final answer is: 147"
"To find out how many matches Joey played in one week, we need to add up the number of matches he played on each day.

"Let's break down the information given. 

Let x be the number of votes against the new regulation. 
Since there are twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x. 

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against, which is 33. 
So, we can write the equation: x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

Since x is the number of votes against the new regulation, the number of votes in favor is 2x. 
2x = 2 * 11 = 22

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

The remaining people are 50 - 10 = 40 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win.
60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.
2. One third of the Pomeranians are girls.
3. There are 6 Pomeranian girls.

From point 2, we know that 1/3 of the Pomeranians are girls, and we know there are 6 Pomeranian girls. To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that 2/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and we know there are 18 Pomeranians. To find the total number of puppies, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total Puppies = 27

"To find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we first need to calculate how much money he has after receiving the money from his sister. 

Jayden initially had $70. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. 

So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

"Let's break down the information given:

- The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250.
- The first house needs 1/2 of what the second house needs.
- The third house needs double what the first house needs.

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as x. Then, the first house needs x/2 cases, and the third house needs 2*(x/2) = x cases.

Since the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250, we can set up the equation:

x + (x/2) + x = 250

To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms:

5x = 500

Now, divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

Since the third house needs x cases, and x = 100, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 100"

So, Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books in one hour.

Ezra decided to read 150 more books. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed. 

Ezra's total books = 300 (initial) + 150 (additional) = 450 books
Ahmed's total books = 150 books

Total books read by both = Ezra's total books + Ahmed's total books = 450 + 150 = 600 books

"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then add them together.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Her earnings for the hours are 5 hours * $15 per hour = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for the hours are 2 hours * $15 per hour = $30. Since she teaches more than 3 classes is not true, she does not earn an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Now, let's add the earnings for both days: $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

First, Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount he gets from selling eggplants is 20 x 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he already has $60 from selling eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling corn.

Bennet has 25 ears of corn, and he needs to make $75 from selling them. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount he needs to make ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25).

$75 ÷ 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at 75 mph. To find the time it takes to drive to the museum, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.

Time to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since he drives back, the total driving time is 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours.

Adding the time he spends at the museum, the total time Jack is gone from home is 4 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle, and he has 73 motorcycles. So, the total number of wheels for the motorcycles is 2 * 73 = 146.

Now, we add the total number of wheels for the cars and the motorcycles: 228 + 146 = 374.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels in it. To find out how many wheels will be left, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the total number of wheels in the box: 650 - 374 = 276.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so that's 600 / 3 = 200 movies.

The cost of the movies in series is 200 * $6 = $1200.

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies. 200 movies are in series, so 600 - 200 = 400 movies are not in series.

40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so that's 0.4 * 400 = 160 movies.

The cost of the older movies is 160 * $5 = $800.

The number of normal movies is 400 - 160 = 240 movies.

The cost of the normal movies is 240 * $10 = $2400.

The total cost is $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma.

Let's assume Emma's score is x. 

Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's enemy score is x + 8 * 10 = x + 80.
Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, Ava's berry score is x + 3 * 5 = x + 15.
Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, Ava's timer score is (60 - 4) - (60 - x) * 30 = -240 + 30x.

The total score for Emma is x.
The total score for Ava is (x + 80) + (x + 15) + (-240 + 30x) = 31x - 145.

The difference between their scores is (31x - 145) - x = 30x - 145.

To find the difference, we need to know the value of x. However, the problem doesn't provide a specific value for x. But we can express the difference in terms of x.

Since the problem asks for the difference between their scores, we need to find a specific value for x. However, the problem doesn't provide a specific value for x. But we can express the difference in terms of x.

However, we can assume that Emma's score is 0, which is the minimum possible score. In this case, the difference between their scores is 30 * 0 - 145 = -145.

But if we assume that Emma's score is the maximum possible score, which is 60 * 30 = 1800, then the difference between their scores is 30 * 1800 - 145 = 54435.

But since the problem doesn't provide a specific value for x, we can't find a unique numerical answer. However, we can express the difference in terms of x.

However, if we assume that the problem is asking for the difference in terms of x, then the answer is 30x - 145.

But if we assume that the problem is asking for a specific numerical answer, then we need to make an assumption about the value of x. 

However, if we assume that the problem is asking for the difference when Emma's score is the average possible score, which is (0 + 1800) / 2 = 900, then the difference between their scores is 30 * 900 - 145 = 26935.

But since the problem doesn't provide a specific value for x, we can't find a unique numerical answer.

However, if we assume that the problem is asking for the difference when Emma's score is the average possible score, then the answer is 26935.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that four pizzas were ordered for a total of 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each, so the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 x 30 = 60 dollars. 

Now, we need to find the cost of the other two pizzas. Since the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, and the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each cost 60 dollars in total, the remaining cost for the other two pizzas is 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza. 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on usual days and the extra days to get the total number of times they ride in a week. 15 + 12 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's break down the information given:

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.

After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. The number of orange fish he bought would then be 2x (since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish).

The total number of fish in the pet store tank was 17, and it's a mix of white and orange fish. Since Bob bought all the fish from the tank, the total number of fish he bought is 17.

The total number of fish in Bob's pond after buying more fish is 7 (initial fish) + 17 (bought fish) = 24.

The number of white fish in Bob's pond after buying more fish is 4 (initial white fish) + x (white fish bought).

The number of orange fish in Bob's pond after buying more fish is 3 (initial orange fish) + 2x (orange fish bought).

Since the total number of fish in the pond is 24, we can set up the equation:

4 + x + 3 + 2x = 24

Combine like terms:

3x + 7 = 24

Subtract 7 from both sides:

3x = 17

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 17/3

x = 5.67

Since the number of fish must be a whole number, and we're dealing with a real-world scenario where you can't buy a fraction of a fish, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can solve for the number of white fish Bob bought by using the fact that the total number of fish he bought was 17. 

Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'w' and the number of orange fish he bought as 'o'. We know that w + o = 17 and o = 2w.

Substituting o = 2w into the first equation, we get:

w + 2w = 17

Combine like terms:

3w = 17

Divide both sides by 3:

w = 17/3

w = 5.67

However, we can solve this problem by using the fact that the total number of fish in the pond is 24 and the ratio of orange to white fish is 2:1.

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total miles driven per week and then multiply it by the fuel efficiency and the price of gas.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per week. Since Andy drives to work and back home every day from Monday to Friday, the total miles driven per day is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles. 

The total miles driven per week is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, let's calculate the total gallons of gas consumed per week. We can do this by dividing the total miles driven per week by the fuel efficiency (10 MPG).

Total gallons of gas consumed per week = Total miles driven per week / Fuel efficiency
= 50 miles/week / 10 MPG
= 5 gallons/week

Finally, let's calculate the total money spent on gas per week by multiplying the total gallons of gas consumed per week by the price of gas.

Total money spent on gas per week = Total gallons of gas consumed per week * Price of gas
= 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon
= $15/week

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent, then add them together.

First, let's find the value of the quarters. Carrie was given 140 quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25. 

Value of quarters = 140 * $0.25 = $35

Next, let's find the value of the twenties she spent. Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. 

Number of twenties spent = 10 * 3/5 = 6

Value of twenties spent = 6 * $20 = $120

Now, let's add the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties to find the total amount of money she paid for lunch.

Total amount spent = $35 + $120 = $155

The final answer is: $155"
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and the total number of eggplants separately and then add them together.

For tomatoes: 5 plants * 22 tomatoes per plant = 110 tomatoes
For eggplants: 8 plants * 4 eggplants per plant = 32 eggplants

Now, let's add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants: 110 + 32 = 142

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to find the total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the total number of smart and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

So, Samwell sold 25 OLED TVs."
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first determine how much the school will cover. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we can calculate this as:

Half of the trip cost = $300 / 2 = $150

The school will cover $150, and John has $50. To find out how much more money John needs, we subtract the amount he has from the amount the school will cover:

Amount John is missing = Amount school will cover - Amount John has
= $150 - $50
= $100

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature difference between the current temperature and the freezing point. 

The current temperature during the day is 45 degrees. It's 33 degrees colder during the night, so the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees. 

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, we need to find the difference between the night temperature and the freezing point: 12 - 32 = -20 degrees. 

However, since we can't burn a negative number of logs, we need to find the difference between the current temperature and the freezing point: 45 - 32 = 13 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we can divide the temperature difference by the heat each log provides: 13 / 5 = 2.6.

Since we can't burn a fraction of a log, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the pipes don't freeze. 

2.6 rounded up is 3.

"To find the total number of seashells, we first need to find the number of groups and then the number of groups that brought back seashells. 

First, we find the number of groups: 
Number of people = 90
Number of people per group = 9
Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Next, we find the number of groups that brought back seashells:
Fraction of groups that brought back seashells = 3/5
Number of groups that brought back seashells = Number of groups * Fraction of groups that brought back seashells
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 6

Now, we find the total number of seashells:
Number of seashells per group = 2
Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total number of seashells = 6 * 2
Total number of seashells = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the number of people on the train, we need to subtract the people who got off and add the people who got on.

Initially, there were 172 people on the train.

At the first stop, 47 people got off, so we subtract 47 from 172: 172 - 47 = 125.

Then, 13 people got on, so we add 13 to 125: 125 + 13 = 138.

At the next stop, 38 people got off, so we subtract 38 from 138: 138 - 38 = 100.

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to multiply the number of bottle caps he finds per day by the value of each bottle cap and then multiply that by the number of days in the month.

Number of bottle caps per day: 10
Value of each bottle cap: $0.25
Number of days in the month: 30

First, multiply the number of bottle caps per day by the value of each bottle cap: 
10 * $0.25 = $2.50 per day

Then, multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in the month:
$2.50 * 30 = $75

So, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month."
"To find Jamie's total earnings for the day, we need to calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional 3 hours.

Her regular hourly rate is $20. For 8 hours, she earns 8 * $20 = $160.

For the additional 3 hours, she earns 150% of her regular hourly rate, which is 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour. For 3 hours, she earns 3 * $30 = $90.

Her total earnings for the day are $160 + $90 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To find the total number of lions, we need to add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs.

The number of female lions is given as 12. 
The number of male lions is half the number of female lions, so it is 12 / 2 = 6.
The number of lion cubs is given as 14.

Now, let's add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs: 
12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

The total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price. 

First, let's find the discount amount: 
Discount = 25% of $40
Discount = 0.25 * $40
Discount = $10

Now, let's find the price after the discount:
Price after discount = Original price - Discount
Price after discount = $40 - $10
Price after discount = $30

Now, let's find out how much money Mike will have left over:
Money left over = $50 - $30
Money left over = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total salary for each month, then multiply it by 3.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After 3 months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (hired in the first month) + 20 (hired in the second month) + 20 (hired in the third month) = 260 employees

The total salary for each month is the number of employees multiplied by the salary per employee:
200 employees * $4000 = $800,000 per month

Since the company pays this amount every month for 3 months, the total amount paid is:
$800,000 * 3 = $2,400,000

The final answer is: $2,400,000"
"To find the total time the choir will be caroling, we need to add the time it takes to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and the time it takes to sing ""Jingle Bells"" once.

First, let's calculate the total time for ""Deck the Halls"":
150 seconds * 2 = 300 seconds

Then, let's add the time for ""Jingle Bells"":
300 seconds + 240 seconds = 540 seconds

The choir will be caroling for 540 seconds."
"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial pay rate is $10 per hour. After 2 months, he gets a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new pay rate $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After another year, he gets a raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final pay rate $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, so her starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours:

Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $10 per hour + 18 hours * $10.50 per hour + 2 hours * $11.50 per hour
= 200 + 189 + 23
= 412 dollars

Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour
= 210 dollars

The difference in their earnings is $412 - $210 = 202 dollars.

The final answer is: $202"
"To find the difference in cost, we need to calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels separately, then subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread.

The cost of 3 loaves of bread is 3 x $2 = $6.
The cost of 2 bagels is 2 x $1 = $2.

Now, we subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread: $6 - $2 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To find out how many points Nikita scored, we need to calculate half of Pierson's score and then add 11. 

Pierson's score is 278. Half of 278 is 278 / 2 = 139. 

Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, so Nikita scored 139 + 11 = 150.

To find the total points, we need to add Pierson's score and Nikita's score. 

Pierson's score is 278 and Nikita's score is 150. 

278 + 150 = 428.

The final answer is: 428"
"To find the total number of trees planted by the students, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of students per class and then multiply the result by 1 (since each student plants 1 tree).

Total students = 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students
Total trees planted by students = 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

To find the total number of trees planted by the teachers, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of teachers per class and then multiply the result by 2 (since each teacher plants 2 trees).

Total teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers
Total trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Now, we add the total number of trees planted by students and teachers to find the total number of trees planted.

Total trees = 1000 trees (by students) + 240 trees (by teachers) = 1240 trees

The final answer is: 1240"
"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 4.2 stuffed goats, but we will round down to 4 stuffed goats because you can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal."
"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in 2 weeks and 1 week.

In 2 weeks, there are 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in 2 weeks.

In 1 week, there are 7 days. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in 1 week.

Total hours Kris has played is 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours. So, the hours she still needs to play is 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car has traveled in that time.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will have traveled:
60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will have traveled:
70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles

Since the second car was initially passing the first car, we need to find the distance between them after 2 hours. This is the difference between the distance traveled by the second car and the distance traveled by the first car:
140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

So, after 2 hours, the two cars will be 20 miles apart."
"To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the diamond and the gold, then add the 30% premium.

The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. 
The total cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900.

The 30% premium is 30% of $900, which is 0.3 x $900 = $270.

The total amount James paid is $900 + $270 = $1170.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice the fourth-graders', so it's 2 * 40 = 80 out of 400 passed

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460 students passed

Next, let's calculate the total number of students in the school:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000 students

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
(460 students passed / 1000 total students) * 100 = 46%

The final answer is: 46"
"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to determine how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch, and he has 2 bags of glass chips, we need to find out how many chips he has in total. 

Each bag holds 72 chips, so 2 bags will hold 2 x 72 = 144 chips.

Now, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of chips needed to make one square inch. 

144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches.

Since the mosaic is three inches tall, and it's a square mosaic, we need to find the length of the mosaic. 

To do this, we need to find the square root of the total square inches, since the area of a square is length x width, and the length and width are equal. 

The square root of 12 is approximately 3.46. 

However, since we are looking for the length, and the mosaic is three inches tall, we can assume that the length will be the same as the height, which is three inches, but we need to find the total area of the mosaic that can be made with the glass chips. 

Since the total area is 12 square inches, and the height is 3 inches, we can find the length by dividing the total area by the height. 

12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

However, this is the total area of the mosaic that can be made with the glass chips, not the length. Since the mosaic is a square, we need to find the square root of the total area to get the length.

"To find the total amount of tea left, we need to calculate the total amount of tea drank by the students. 

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea drank is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts. 

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party in gallons is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"Dale initially had 100 candies. He sold 150, so he had 100 - 150 = -50 candies left. 

Since he can't have a negative number of candies, this means he actually sold more than he had. However, we can continue with the problem as if he had 0 candies left.

Then he ordered 100 more candies, so now he has 0 + 100 = 100 candies.

To find out how many he still needs to sell, we need to add the total number of candies he has (100) to the initial number of candies he ordered (100). 

100 (current candies) + 100 (initial candies) = 200

Since he has 200 candies and he wants to sell all of them, he needs to sell 200 candies in total.

The final answer is: 200"

To find the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, we need to subtract the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May:

320 (total students at the end of May) - 10 (initial students) = 310

So, 310 additional students would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year.

310"
"To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25).

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (5 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 x 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 x 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used and the ones dropped from the total number of marshmallows in the bag.

Total marshmallows in the bag: 35
Marshmallows used by John: 9
Marshmallows used by DeSean: 9
Total marshmallows used: 9 + 9 = 18
Marshmallows dropped: 3
Total marshmallows lost: 18 + 3 = 21
Marshmallows left: 35 - 21 = 14

Now, we need to find out how many S'mores each kid can make with the remaining marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores each kid can make is equal to the number of marshmallows left divided by 2 (since there are two kids).

Marshmallows left: 14
Number of kids: 2
S'mores each kid can make: 14 / 2 = 7

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the total time played by each person and then multiply it by the cost per minute. 

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. 
Two of his friends can play for half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. 
One of his friends can play for 1.5 times as long, so they can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter.

The total time played is 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Jack's time: 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters
Two friends' time: 240 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters * 2 = 48 quarters
Better friend's time: 240 minutes / 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters

Total quarters used = 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 * 0.25 = $17.

The final answer is: $17"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces.
- The amount of citrus zest is equal to the amount of fragrance.
- The amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x. Then, the amount of salt (and sugar) is 2x, and the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total amount of the scrub is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: x (citrus zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces.

Combine like terms: 8x = 10.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 10 / 8 = 1.25.

Since the amount of oil is 4x, the amount of oil is 4 * 1.25 = 5 ounces.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows, then add them together.

The cost of 3 goats at $500 each is 3 x $500 = $1500.
The cost of 2 cows at $1500 each is 2 x $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul should buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Paul needs 63 cupcakes in total. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, so the total number of cupcakes he has is 8 + 40 = 48.

Now, let's subtract the number of cupcakes he has from the total number of cupcakes he needs: 63 - 48 = 15.

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

4. In total, Joe sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars. So, he gave away a total of 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

5. To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the total number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine how much money the students raised in total. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the students raised $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we know that there are 20 students and they all raised the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the number of students: $125,000 / 20 = $6,250.

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 
On the second day, she walked half as many hours as the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

Now, we need to convert the hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we multiply the hours by 60 to get the total minutes.

Time on the first day: 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes
Time on the second day: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

Total time = Time on the first day + Time on the second day
Total time = 480 minutes + 240 minutes
Total time = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first find the total number of cars in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break.

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When he got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 of the cars had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 had left, so 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars had left.

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35.

However, the question asks for the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break. This would be the number of cars that were present when he got out of class for the lunch break, which is 35.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how much John makes in a day, we need to multiply the number of cycles he does in a day by the number of tasks in each cycle and the pay per task. 

Number of cycles per day: 30
Number of tasks per cycle: 5
Pay per task: $1.20

Daily earnings = Number of cycles per day * Number of tasks per cycle * Pay per task
Daily earnings = 30 * 5 * $1.20
Daily earnings = $180

To find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7.

Weekly earnings = Daily earnings * 7
Weekly earnings = $180 * 7
Weekly earnings = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find out how many points Sasha scored in the first game, we already know that she scored 14 points.

In the first game, Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game, so Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages of dog food by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food: 88 - 36 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, Smendrick has 3x cards, and Becca has 3x + 12 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has by substituting x = 47 into the expression 3x + 12:

Becca has 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs.

She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

To find the total number of eggs, we add the number of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

The cost of shipping is calculated as follows:
- Cost per pound: $0.35
- Weight of the book: 4 pounds
- Cost per mile: $0.08
- Distance to the distribution center: 20 miles
- Total cost of shipping: (0.35 * 4) + (0.08 * 20) = 1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00

The refund amount is 75% of the purchase price:
- Purchase price: $32
- Refund amount: 0.75 * 32 = 24

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:
- Total cost of shipping: $3.00
- Refund amount: $24
- Total loss: 3.00 - 24 = -21

However, since we can't lose a negative amount of money, we need to recalculate the total loss by considering the shipping cost as a separate expense. 

- Total cost of shipping: $3.00
- Refund amount: $24
- Total loss: 3.00 + (32 - 24) = 3.00 + 8 = 11

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars.
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends per week and multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time she spends on TikTok per week:

- Time spent recording videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes
- Time spent writing songs: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes
- Total time per week: 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the total time per week by 4:
282 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1128 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
1128 minutes / 60 = 18.8 hours

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. Angela has additional items to be installed: 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. 

First, let's calculate the number of additional items: 
- Mirrors: 6 (additional) + 4 (initial) = 10
- Chandeliers: 2 (additional) + 1 (initial) = 3
- Pictures: 20 (additional) + 10 (initial) = 30

Now, let's calculate the cost of the additional items:
- Mirrors: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00
- Chandeliers: 3 * $15.00 = $45.00
- Pictures: 30 * $15.00 = $450.00

The total cost of the additional items is $150.00 + $45.00 + $450.00 = $645.00

Now, let's add the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items:

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to find out how high Saskay can lift a mountain, then multiply it by 12, then multiply that by 4, and finally multiply that by 10.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, which is 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, which is 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, which is 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we need to convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12. 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, one kangaroo would take 18 * 3 = 54 hours to travel across the highway.

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, if one kangaroo takes 54 hours, one turtle would take 54 * 2 = 108 hours to travel across the highway.

Since there are four turtles, and they are traveling at the same speed, we need to divide the time it takes for one turtle by 4 to find the time it takes for all four turtles. 

So, 108 / 4 = 27 hours.

The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow. To find out how many cows he needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can divide 25 by 5.

25 liters / 5 liters per cow = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to find out how many more cows he needs to have 5 cows in total.

5 cows (required) - 3 cows (already have) = 2 cows

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the used length of each glue stick and subtract it from the original length.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the used length is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6 of the original length. 
5/6 * 12 = 10 millimeters used, so the unused length is 12 - 10 = 2 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the used length is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 of the original length. 
1/3 * 12 = 4 millimeters used, so the unused length is 12 - 4 = 8 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the used length is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2 of the original length. 
1/2 * 12 = 6 millimeters used, so the unused length is 12 - 6 = 6 millimeters.

Now, let's add up the unused lengths of all three glue sticks: 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters."

"Let's break down the information given:

- Total students: 20
- Students good at math only: 5
- Students good at English only: 8
- Students good at both math and English: unknown (let's call this x)

Since the total number of students is the sum of students good at math only, students good at English only, and students good at both, we can set up the equation:

5 (math only) + 8 (English only) + x (both) = 20 (total)

Combine the constants:
13 + x = 20

Subtract 13 from both sides:
x = 7

This means 7 students are good at both math and English. To find the total number of students good at math, we need to add the students good at math only and the students good at both:

From Farm Y, twice as many goats were sold as from Farm X, so 2 * 10 = 20 goats were sold from Farm Y.

Now, let's calculate the number of goats left in each farm:
- Farm X: 55 - 10 = 45 goats
- Farm Y: 45 - 20 = 25 goats

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats in Farm X and Farm Y: 45 + 25 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount he spends on shoes each year by the number of pairs he buys in a year.

Since James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, he buys 2 * 12 = 24 pairs of shoes in a year.

The total amount he spends on shoes each year is $2640.

To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount by the number of pairs: $2640 / 24 = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, then subtract the discount for the red food.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 x $25 = $75.
The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 x $18 = $54.
The total cost before discount is $75 + $54 = $129.
The discount for 3 baskets of red food is 3 x $2 = $6.
The total cost after discount is $129 - $6 = $123.

The final answer is: $123"
"To find the number of rooms to be cleaned, we need to calculate one-half of 90 rooms. 

90 / 2 = 45 rooms

Now, we need to find the total time it takes to clean 45 rooms. It takes 20 minutes to clean each room, so we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years, which is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Then, they will double this amount, so 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

The final answer is: 144"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. I am three years younger than my brother, so if my age is x, my brother's age is x + 3.
2. I am 2 years older than my sister, so my sister's age is x - 2.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so my mom's age is 3(x + 3) - 1.
4. When you add all our ages, you get 87: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 
x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87
Combine x terms: 
6x + 9 = 87

Subtract 9 from both sides: 
6x = 78

Divide both sides by 6: 
x = 13

So, I am 13 years old."
"To find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required and then divide that by the number of glue sticks in each pack.

Total number of students: 27
Number of glue sticks per student: 2
Total number of glue sticks required: 27 * 2 = 54

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by 8 to find out how many packs are needed.

54 ÷ 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are asked to assume he will have some extra glue sticks left over, so we can round down to the nearest whole number.

6.75 ≈ 6.75 → 7 (rounding up would be 7, but since we are assuming he will have some extra glue sticks left over, we can round down to 6)

However, if we round down to 6, we will not have enough glue sticks for all the students. So, we will round up to 7 packs.

7 packs of glue sticks will give us 7 * 8 = 56 glue sticks. This is more than the 54 glue sticks needed, so Mr. Jackson will have some extra glue sticks left over.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to calculate the amount of water on the first day, the second day, and the third day, and then add them together.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it is 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it is 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we add the amounts from each day: 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: 24000"
"To find the total number of people infected after three days, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the previous total.

Day 1: 
- Initially, there are 10 people infected.
- Each infected person infects 6 others, so 10 * 6 = 60 new infections.
- Total infected after Day 1: 10 (initial) + 60 (new) = 70.

Day 2: 
- The 60 people infected on Day 1 infect 60 * 6 = 360 others.
- The 10 people from the initial infection are still infected, so we add the 360 new infections to them.
- Total infected after Day 2: 70 (previous total) + 360 (new) = 430.

Day 3: 
- The 360 people infected on Day 2 infect 360 * 6 = 2160 others.
- The 70 people from the previous days are still infected, so we add the 2160 new infections to them.
- Total infected after Day 3: 430 (previous total) + 2160 (new) = 2590.

The final answer is: 2590"
"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of the amount Rafaela received and subtract it from Rafaela's total. 

Rafaela received 40 * $20 = $800.

10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80.

So, Julieta received $800 - $80 = $720.

The total amount they received altogether is $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to first calculate how many oranges she gave away. 

She gave her three daughters 2 oranges each, so 3 daughters * 2 oranges = 6 oranges. 
She also gave her boy 3 oranges. 
In total, she gave away 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges initially. 
So, to find out how many oranges she remained with, we subtract the number of oranges she gave away from the total number of oranges she bought: 
12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each girl is:

- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:

36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold. 

She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, she baked 2 * 5 = 10 loaves. 

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she baked 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, and she sold all 80 slices. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars.

The final answer is: $40"
"Let's break down the information given. 

We know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. If Gretchen had 70 gold coins, then the number of silver coins can be found by subtracting 30 from 70. 

Number of silver coins = 70 - 30 = 40

Now, to find the total number of coins, we need to add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins.

Total number of coins = Number of gold coins + Number of silver coins
Total number of coins = 70 + 40
Total number of coins = 110

"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we first need to calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. 

There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George ate 20 burritos. 

The total number of burritos ordered was 600. 

To find the total number of leftover burritos, we subtract the number of burritos given to the students and the number eaten by Mr. George from the total number of burritos ordered. 

So, the total number of leftover burritos is 600 - (500 + 20) = 600 - 520 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first determine the number of green and blue cars. 

The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

The total number of red, green, and blue cars is 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We know that S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
We also know that A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the first equation into the second one to get S = (F - 12) + 25
S = F + 13

We also know that S + A + F = 85 (Together, they have 85 books)

Substituting the first equation into this one, we get (F + 13) + A + F = 85
Combine like terms: 2F + A + 13 = 85

Substituting the second equation into this one, we get 2F + (F - 12) + 13 = 85
Combine like terms: 3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides: 3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3: F = 28

"To find out how much change the seller will give back, we need to calculate the total cost of the phones and subtract that from the $4000 given by the seller.

The total cost of the phones is 5 phones * $700 per phone = $3500.

Now, we subtract the total cost from the $4000 given by the seller: $4000 - $3500 = $500.

So, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to find out how much Keenan spends in a month. 

Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays 40% of the cost. 

40% of $400 is 0.4 x 400 = $160. 

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we need to divide the amount Keenan spends in a month by 4 to find out how much he spends per week. 

$160 / 4 = $40.

"To find out how many pieces Tobias ate in total, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day and add them up.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. First, we need to find out how many pieces were left after the first two days. 
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces left.

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26. 
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. This means that her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's call this number 'x'. So, her age after 'x' years will be 8 + x.

We are told that her age after 'x' years will be thrice her present age, which is 8. So, we can set up the equation: 8 + x = 3 * 8.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 8 + x = 24.

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. Subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation, we get: x = 24 - 8.

x = 16.

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken. Since each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and the 5 packs of bacon cost $10, each pack of chicken costs $10 / 5 = $2. Since Kelly has 6 packs of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $2 = $12.

Next, let's find the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Now, let's find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $12 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $48.

"Let's break down the information given. 

Let the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts be x minutes. 

The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so its runtime is 2x minutes. 

At the end of the concert, she also performs a 15-minute encore. 

The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, which is the sum of the runtime of the concert and the encore. 

So, we can write the equation: 2x + 15 = 65.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. 

Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

"To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs. 

Let's assume the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is x. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the total number of microphones arranged in pairs is 2x.

However, we know that 20% of the total 50 microphones won't fit, which means 80% of the microphones will be arranged in pairs. 

We can set up the equation: 80% of 50 = 2x

To find 80% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.8: 
50 * 0.8 = 40

Now we have the equation: 40 = 2x

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
x = 40 / 2
x = 20

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x. Then, the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11x. We know that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, so we can set up the equation:

11x = 121

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 11:

x = 121 / 11
x = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob is 11 meters per second, we can find the speed of the whirligig. The whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob, so we can multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55

The final answer is: 55"
"Let's break down the information given. Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad. 

Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

We know that Ellen pays a total of $11 for her daily goods. We also know that she pays $6 for the salad and $3 for the yogurt. 

So, the total cost of the carrots and the yogurt is $11 - $6 - $3 = $2. Since Ellen eats two carrots every day, the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Tasha made $80 in total from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.
2. She made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn.
3. The number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is three times the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn.
4. The number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is five times the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn.

Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. Then, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is 3x, and the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is 5x.

Since she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is $6x + $6(3x) + $6(5x) = $6(8x) = $48x.

We know that the total amount she made from mowing lawns and selling lemonade is $80. So, we can set up the equation:

$48x + (lemonade sales) = $80

We also know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, so we can substitute $6x for $6 in the equation:

$48x + (lemonade sales) = $80
$6x + (lemonade sales) = $32 (since $48x - $6x = $42x, and $80 - $42x = $32)

Now, we can solve for lemonade sales:

lemonade sales = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to find Christian's weight first, then subtract 5 kg from it.

Martin's weight is 55 kg. 
Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"To find the total amount John earns from renting his car, we need to multiply the number of times he rents it by the number of hours and the hourly rate.

Number of times rented: 10
Number of hours per rental: 3
Hourly rate: $25

Total earnings = Number of times rented * Number of hours per rental * Hourly rate
Total earnings = 10 * 3 * $25
Total earnings = $750

Now, we need to subtract the car payment from the total earnings to find the profit.

Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

The final answer is: $250"
"Let's break down the information given. Martha initially had some notebooks, and then she bought 5 more, resulting in a total of 7 notebooks. This means she initially had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, and Martha had 2 notebooks initially, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. So, Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we first need to find out how far Anis rowed. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. 

1/5 of 50 miles is 50 * 1/5 = 10 miles. 

So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles. 

Now, we add the distance rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance. 

Total distance = 50 miles (Dijana) + 60 miles (Anis) = 110 miles.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we first need to determine how many cookies are left after Susan's husband took some. 

Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies, so we subtract 4 from 100: 100 - 4 = 96 cookies left.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. 

96 cookies / 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today.

So, Denise read a total of 10 + 18 = 28 pages, and Daniel read a total of 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the number of pages Daniel read from the number of pages Denise read: 28 - 13 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bowls of soup Calvin's family will use for dinner. 

Calvin, his wife, and their two children make a total of 3 + 1 + 2 = 6 people.

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, and there are 6 people in total, we can assume that the pot can fill 6 child bowls because 6 is closer to 8 than 4.

If the pot can fill 8 child bowls, and 6 people will eat 6 bowls, then there will be 8 - 6 = 2 bowls of soup left.

Since there are 2 children, and there are 2 bowls of soup left, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 / 2 = 1 time.

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks: 
- Each small mask requires 2 yards of material.
- Jo needs to make 20 small masks.
- Total material required for small masks = 20 * 2 = 40 yards.

For large masks: 
- Each large mask requires 2.25 yards of material.
- Jo needs to make 8 large masks.
- Total material required for large masks = 8 * 2.25 = 18 yards.

Total material required = material for small masks + material for large masks = 40 + 18 = 58 yards.

"To find out how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night, so he has 24 - 10 = 14 hours left in his day.

He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog from the total hours in a day: 
14 - 8 - 1 = 5

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write the equation:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2x

We know that Duncan's current age is 60, so we can find his age eight years ago by subtracting 8 from 60:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 60 - 8
Duncan's age eight years ago = 52

Now we can equate this to 2x:

52 = 2x

To find x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 52 / 2
x = 26

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to x:

Adam's current age = x + 4
Adam's current age = 26 + 4
Adam's current age = 30

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = Adam's current age + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

"To find the total acres of Farmer Smith's farm, we need to calculate twice the acres of Farmer Brown's farm and add 100 to it. 

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 

Adding 100 acres to that would be 400 + 100 = 500 acres for Farmer Smith's farm.

Now, to find the total acres of both farms, we add the acres of Farmer Brown's farm to the acres of Farmer Smith's farm. 

200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to first determine how many packages he completes in an hour and then multiply that by the number of hours he works and his hourly wage.

Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

In an eight-hour workday, he would complete 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, his total earnings for the day would be 320 * $0.20 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku and then divide it by the time it takes to drink one bottle of water.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so an extreme sudoku takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to convert the time from minutes to half hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 2 half hours in an hour. 

180 minutes is equal to 180 / 30 = 6 half hours.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, he drinks 6 bottles of water in 6 half hours.

- Total bologna thrown = 58
- Number of red balloons = 20

Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, the total bologna thrown at red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, let's find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at yellow balloons. 
Total bologna thrown at yellow balloons = Total bologna thrown - Total bologna thrown at red balloons
= 58 - 40

"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days. 

Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so the total miles driven is 100 * 30 = 3000 miles.

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we need to divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs.

3000 miles / 1000 miles per tune-up = 3 tune-ups.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The cost of the cake is $11.
2. The cost of 1 dozen balloons is $0.5 for 2 balloons. To find the cost of 1 balloon, we divide $0.5 by 2, which is $0.25. Since there are 12 balloons in a dozen, the total cost of the balloons is 12 * $0.25 = $3.
3. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.
4. The total cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.
5. Let's assume the total allowance given by Julia and Nadine's mother is x. Since they combined their allowance, the total amount they had is 2x.
6. Since they spent $28, we can set up the equation 2x - 28 = 0 (since they spent the entire amount).
7. Solving for x, we get 2x = 28, and x = 28 / 2 = 14.

"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we first need to determine how many cups of tea are in each row. 

Lana has 27 cups of tea in total and divides them into 3 rows. So, the number of cups in each row is 27 / 3 = 9 cups.

Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row is also 9 / 2 = 4.5. However, since you can't have half a cup, this means that the number of mint tea cups in each row must be 4 or 5. 

However, if there were 4 mint tea cups in each row, then there would be 4 chamomile tea cups in each row, and the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 4 = 12. This leaves 27 - 12 - 12 = 3 cups of tea for the cinnamon tea, which is not enough to make 15 cups of cinnamon tea.

"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to first determine how many trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes the sloth 4 hours to make a round trip, he can make 8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips in 8 hours.

Since he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and he makes 2 trips, he needs to collect 24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip.

"To find the amount of water in the tank, we need to first determine how much water was initially filled into the tank. Since they filled the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, we can calculate this as follows:

10000 gallons (pool) / 2 = 5000 gallons (initial water in the tank)

Next, we need to find out how much water is used from the tank in 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so we can calculate this as follows:

500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons

Now, we need to subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find the remaining amount of water:

5000 gallons - 3000 gallons = 2000 gallons

"To find out how many movies Colby can see, we need to first calculate how much money he has left. 

Colby's monthly budget is $150. He has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Money left: $150 - $130 = $20

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 and he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can see 1 more movie on a Friday or Saturday. 

Now, let's calculate how much money is left for other days. 

Money left for other days: $20 - $10 = $10

Tickets for other days cost $7, so he can see 1 more movie on an other day.

"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 
Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories. 
Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories from both types of pastries are 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days = 378 / 5 = 75.6"
"To find out how far each vehicle traveled, we need to multiply their speeds by the time they traveled.

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so it traveled 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so it traveled 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.

"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and John's age as J. 

We know that Pp = J + 10. 
We also know that P = Pp + J. 
We also know that P + Pp + J = 100.

Substituting Pp = J + 10 into the equation P = Pp + J, we get P = (J + 10) + J, which simplifies to P = 2J + 10.

Substituting P = 2J + 10 and Pp = J + 10 into the equation P + Pp + J = 100, we get (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100.

Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80.

Divide both sides by 4: J = 20.

Now that we know J = 20, we can find Pp = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.

Finally, we can find P = Pp + J = 30 + 20 = 50.

"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had a total of 1 (Maria's balloon) + 4 * 2 (friends' balloons) = 1 + 8 = 9 balloons.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons: 9 + 15 = 24.

"To find out how many tables they need, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so they have 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. 
They already have 10 boxes, so in total, they have 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

They can fit 2 boxes per table, and they already have 15 tables. To find out how many more tables they need, we need to divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes per table and subtract the number of tables they already have.

60 boxes / 2 boxes per table = 30 tables needed
30 tables needed - 15 tables they already have = 15 tables needed

So, they need 15 new tables.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both of them is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

They spat a total of 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

The average total distance spat is 820 / 75 = 10.93 (rounded to two decimal places).

"To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then multiply that by the price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine:

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Now, let's find the difference in revenue:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay with the 24-hour option and the cost of his stay with the 12-hour option plus the additional hours.

Cameron stays from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. 

The 24-hour option would cost 1600 pesos.

For the 12-hour option, Cameron pays 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. Then, he pays 70 pesos for every additional hour. Since he stays for 5 more hours (17 - 12 = 5), he pays 5 * 70 = 350 pesos for the additional hours. So, the total cost for the 12-hour option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour option from the cost of the 24-hour option: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The answer is 250."
"To find out how much hay each sheep needs, we need to calculate twice the amount each goat needs and then subtract 3 pounds. 

Twice the amount each goat needs is 2 * 5 = 10 pounds. 
Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than that, so each sheep needs 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately. 

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds.
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds.

To find the total amount of hay needed, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

"To find the total time James took to get across the lake, we need to break down the problem into steps.

1. First, we find the distance James swam before resting. Since he swam 60% of the 20-mile lake, we calculate 60% of 20:
   60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles

2. Now, we find the time James took to swim 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour:
   Time = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / 2 mph = 6 hours

3. Since James rested for half as long as the swimming time, we find the resting time:
   Resting time = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

4. The remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. James swims this distance at half his original speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mph.

5. Now, we find the time James took to swim the remaining 8 miles at 1 mph:
   Time = Distance / Speed = 8 miles / 1 mph = 8 hours

6. Finally, we add the swimming time, resting time, and the time taken to swim the remaining distance to find the total time:
   Total time = 6 hours (swimming) + 3 hours (resting) + 8 hours (remaining swimming) = 17 hours

"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D. 

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. 

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can set A + 20 = D + 10. 

We also know that B + A + D = 45. 

We can substitute B = A + 20 into the equation B + A + D = 45, which gives us (A + 20) + A + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2A + D + 20 = 45. 

We can also substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B + A + D = 45, which gives us (D + 10) + A + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2D + A + 10 = 45. 

Now we have two equations: 2A + D + 20 = 45 and 2D + A + 10 = 45. 

We can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate A: (2A + D + 20) - (2D + A + 10) = 45 - 45. 

This simplifies to A - D + 10 = 0. 

We can rearrange the equation to get A - D = -10. 

Now we can add D to both sides to get A = D - 10. 

We can substitute A = D - 10 into the equation B = A + 20, which gives us B = (D - 10) + 20. 

This simplifies to B = D + 10. 

We know that B = D + 10 and B + A + D = 45. 

We can substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B + A + D = 45, which gives us (D + 10) + A + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2D + A + 10 = 45. 

We can substitute A = D - 10 into the equation 2D + A + 10 = 45, which gives us 2D + (D - 10) + 10 = 45. 

This simplifies to 3D = 45. 

We can divide both sides by 3 to get D = 15. 

Now that we know D = 15, we can substitute D = 15 into the equation A = D - 10, which gives us A = 15 - 10. 

This simplifies to A = 5.

"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she usually sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total sleep time, we need to calculate the time from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. This is 7 hours and 55 minutes, which is 7 * 60 + 55 = 455 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from the total sleep time: 455 - 23 = 432 minutes.

The final answer is: 432"
"To find the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially, we need to first find out how many measuring spoons he has in relation to the measuring cups. 

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

Two dozen cups is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 cups.

Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, the number of measuring spoons is 2/3 * 24 = 16.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the measuring spoons and measuring cups. 

Total utensils = 10 measuring spoons + 24 measuring cups = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the number of occupied beds initially, we need to calculate 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital. 

1/5 of 1000 is 100. 

So, the hospital has 100 occupied beds initially. 

Since the hospital has 1000 beds in total, the number of unoccupied beds initially is 1000 - 100 = 900.

Now, let's calculate the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 14 days. 

50 patients are admitted each day, so in 14 days, 50 * 14 = 700 patients are admitted.

The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks is 100 (initially occupied) + 700 (admitted) = 800.

The total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is 1000 (total capacity) - 800 (occupied beds) = 200.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to first find out how many emails are not work-related. 

Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. So, 6 emails are to family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after subtracting the work and family emails. 9 (non-work emails) - 6 (family emails) = 3.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.
2. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya.
3. Aliya is 3 years old.

Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old, we can find Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3:
Shawna's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years

Now that we know Shawna's age, we can find her father's age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5:
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9 = 45 years

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from the number she reported.

Let's assume the number Courtney reported is 100%. 
20% of 100 is 20.

So, the number Kelly said Courtney overstated by 20% is 20.

Now, we need to subtract 20 from the number Courtney reported to find the correct number of people who attended the concert.

Correct number of people = 48 - 20
Correct number of people = 28

The final answer is: 28"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Since Jason carried 2 balls, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey must have carried half of what Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan must have carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

However, this is the number of balls carried by the boys, not the total number of balls the coach brought to practice. Since the boys carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is equal to the number of balls the boys carried.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we first need to determine the total number of holes at the end of the first day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes the first day. 

On the second day, they dug 13 holes, making the total 10 + 13 = 23 holes. 

On the third day, they dug 8 holes, making the total 23 + 8 = 31 holes. However, they filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 31 - 2 = 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, there were 4 * 10 = 40 holes at the end of the fourth day.

Since there were 29 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 15 more than each of them. 

Since the third person got 15 more than Amora and Lainey, the third person got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

We also know that the total number of corn chips is the sum of the amount each person got. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 each, and the third person got 85, the total number of corn chips is 70 + 70 + 85.

70 + 70 + 85 = 225

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, let's find 50% of the cost of supplies. 
50% of $400 is 0.5 * 400 = $200.

Now, we add this to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel.
Cost of travel = Cost of supplies + 50% of cost of supplies
Cost of travel = $400 + $200
Cost of travel = $600

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L. 

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so A + S + L = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so L = S + 5.

We also know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so S = 4A - 13.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one: A + (S + 5) + S = 339.

This simplifies to A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Now we can substitute the third equation into this one: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.

This simplifies to A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.

Combine like terms: 9A - 21 = 339.

Add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Divide by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

The final answer is: 147"
"Let's break down the information given. Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

If there are half as many episodes as minutes per episode, then the number of episodes is 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Then, let's calculate the distance traveled in the northerly direction:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled in the final southerly direction:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

The total distance traveled in the southerly direction is the sum of the first and third distances:
Total southerly distance = 300 miles + 110 miles
Total southerly distance = 410 miles

The distance traveled in the northerly direction is 36 miles. To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we subtract the northerly distance from the total southerly distance:
Distance between homes = Total southerly distance - Northerly distance
Distance between homes = 410 miles - 36 miles
Distance between homes = 374 miles

"To find the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and then subtract the number of brownies eaten.

Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies. 
She received 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office, which is 6 brownies. 
She received 4 dozen brownies from her friends, which is 48 brownies.

Total brownies received = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66

1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Total brownies left over = Total brownies received - Total brownies eaten
= 66 - 18
= 48

"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we need to multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form).

Nani's sister's age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together: Nani's age + brother's age + sister's age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

In this case, the length of the fence is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. 

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2 to find the total number of slats needed.

Total slats = Perimeter * 2
Total slats = 50 * 2
Total slats = 100

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first determine how many oranges she had initially, then subtract the ones she gave away and kept.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. So, she initially had 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, which is 2 * 2 = 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 240 = 60 oranges.

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the ones she gave away and kept from the initial amount: 240 - 80 - 60 = 100 oranges.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Robert has 30 cherries.
- Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard.
- The total number of cherries is 60.

Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, we can represent Richard's cherries as 30 - 10 = 20.

Now, let's find out how many cherries Jerry has. We know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries together. 

So, Jerry has 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.

Now, let's find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. Robert has 30 cherries, and Jerry has 10 cherries.

- Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.
- On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so G = 10.
- On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so A = Sunday's apple pie - 4.
- On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so Sunday's gingerbread = G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.
- On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, we can find the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday. 
Sunday's apple pie = A + 4 = 15
A = 15 - 4 = 11

Now, we can find the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on Saturday and Sunday.
- Saturday's gingerbread = 10
- Saturday's apple pie = 11

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is 19 years old now.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

From point 3, we can deduce that Emil's brother is currently half of Emil's age when Emil turns 24. Since Emil will be 24, his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old now.

From point 2, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old when Emil turns 24.

Since Emil is 19 now, his dad will be 48 - 19 = 29 years old now.

Now, we know Emil's age (19) and his dad's age (29). We also know his brother's age (12).

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to first convert the width of the flower bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between every plant, we need to subtract the width of the plant and the space between plants from the total length of the flower bed. 

Let's assume the number of plants is 'n'. The total width of the plants and spaces is 12n + 18(n-1) inches. We can set up the equation:

12n + 18(n-1) ≤ 1332

Simplifying the equation:

12n + 18n - 18 ≤ 1332
30n - 18 ≤ 1332
30n ≤ 1350
n ≤ 45

Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy 45 - 17 = 28 more flowers.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

First, let's find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we can divide 90 by 6 to get the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp.

90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Now, let's find out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide 90 by 30 to find out how many batches she needs to cook, and then multiply that by 10 to get the total cooking time.

90 / 30 = 3 batches
3 batches * 10 minutes per batch = 30 minutes

However, since peeling and cooking are done simultaneously, we need to add the time it takes to peel and cook. 

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes

So, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature. 

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, and the room warmed up by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total warming effect in 2 hours is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is the sum of the cooling effects minus the warming effect: 6 + 12 - 4 = 14 degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
2. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, Bill saw the comet when he was 3 * 30 = 90 years old.

Now, we need to find out how long ago Bill's dad saw the comet. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can divide the time it takes for the comet to orbit the sun by the age of Bill when he saw the comet the second time to find the time between the two sightings.

Time between sightings = 75 years / 3 = 25 years

Since Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet the second time, we need to subtract the time between the two sightings from his age to find his age when he saw the comet the first time.

Bill's age when he saw the comet the first time = 90 - 25 = 65 years

So, Bill was 65 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

1. Checks for the electric bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
2. Checks for the gas bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month, so 24 checks per year.
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 1 check every 3 months, so 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add up the total number of checks:
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The first plane flies to Greece for 3/4 of its flights, and the remaining flights are split between France and Germany.
- The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes in a day.

Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as 'x'. Since the second plane makes half the number of trips the first plane makes, the second plane also makes 'x/2' trips.

Since the second plane makes 44 trips, we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 44

To find the total number of flights the first plane makes, we can multiply both sides by 2:

x = 44 * 2
x = 88

Now that we know the first plane makes 88 flights in a day, we can find the number of flights to Greece, France, and Germany. The first plane flies to Greece for 3/4 of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is:

(3/4) * 88 = 66

The remaining flights are split between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France and Germany combined is:

88 - 66 = 22

Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is half of 22:

22 / 2 = 11

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's break down the information given. Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $6 = $12. 

So, in total, Adam received $6 from his mother and $12 from his father, which is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam bought the trousers for $30, and he received $18 from his parents. To find out how much he had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. We know that the total age of the children is 20, and Akbar and Alessandro are 3 and 4 years old, respectively. 

The total age of Akbar and Alessandro is 3 + 4 = 7. 

Since the total age of the children is 20, the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 20 - 7 = 13.

We are also given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's denote the average age of the group as A. Then, Helene's age is 2A.

The total age of the group is the sum of the ages of all children, which is A + A + A + 2A = 4A. We know that this is equal to 20.

So, 4A = 20, which means A = 20 / 4 = 5.

Now that we know the average age of the group is 5, we can find Helene's age, which is 2A = 2 * 5 = 10.

Since the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 13, and Helene is 10 years old, Wilfred's age is 13 - 10 = 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected by Walter before his friend donates $200. 

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from a fund he set up online. So, the total amount collected is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's friend donates $200, but this is not included in the amount that Walter's lawyer will base his donation on. The lawyer will base his donation on the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, which is $2000.

Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Since everyone else (neighbors and online fund) donated a total of $2000, the lawyer will donate 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to first find out the total number of cookies. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church, so the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 * 1/2 = 750.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, the number of people in the church is 750 / 15 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Let's assume the total number of slices of the watermelon is 'x'. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 6. 

Let's say each kid gets 'k' slices. Since each adult gets twice as many slices as each kid, each adult gets '2k' slices.

We know that the total number of slices is 6, so we can write the equation: 2 adults * 2k + 4 kids * k = 6

This simplifies to 4k + 4k = 6, which further simplifies to 8k = 6.

Dividing both sides by 8, we get k = 6/8 = 0.75.

Now, we know each kid gets 0.75 slices. Since each adult gets twice as many slices as each kid, each adult gets 2 * 0.75 = 1.5 slices.

The total number of slices is 6, so the total number of slices is 6. The adults get 2 * 1.5 = 3 slices. 

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100. 

(3 / 6) * 100 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments.

Time spent on rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 180 minutes to hours: 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Converting 300 minutes to hours: 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours

Since Doctor Jones works 9 hours at the clinic, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total work hours: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

First, let's add the time to make the cake batter (20 minutes) and bake the cake (30 minutes): 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.

Next, we add the time to cool the cake (2 hours, which is 120 minutes) and the time to frost the cake (10 minutes): 120 + 10 = 130 minutes. 

Now, we add the time to make the cake batter and bake the cake (50 minutes) to the time to cool and frost the cake (130 minutes): 50 + 130 = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

Now, we add the 3 hours to the time she wants to serve the cake (5:00 pm) to find the latest time she can start making the cake: 5:00 pm + 3 hours = 8:00 pm.

The final answer is 8."
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We know they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation: 
8x = 64

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

The number of chocolate bars in a box is 8."
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of the students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, so it is rented 3 * 4 = 12 times a month (assuming a 4-week month).

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25.

The cost of students per session is $1.50 per student, and there are 10 students, so the total cost of students per session is 10 * $1.50 = $15.

The total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $15 (students) = $40.

Since the studio is rented 12 times a month, the total cost per month is 12 * $40 = $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as 'x'. Since Peter has 4 boxes, the total number of chocolate bars he has is 4x. We are given that this total is 64, so we can write the equation:

4x = 64

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 64 / 4
x = 16

So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as 'y'. Since Martha has 7 boxes, the total number of chocolate bars she has is 7y. We are given that this total is 56, so we can write the equation:

7y = 56

To find the value of 'y', we can divide both sides of the equation by 7:

y = 56 / 7
y = 8

So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

To find the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box between Peter and Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in Martha's box from the number of chocolate bars in Peter's box:

16 - 8 = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5. 

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of babies born in a month is 30 * 4 = 120.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the initial population plus the number of babies born in a year. 

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed, we do that next.

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon.

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

The final answer is: $826"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to find the number of blue and yellow sticks first. 

We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

"To find out how much water is remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. 

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons. 

To find the remaining amount of water, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x%.

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is x - 5 * 9 = x - 45%.

In the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining is (x - 45) - 3 * 7 = x - 45 - 21 = x - 66%.

We are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

x - 66 = 28

To solve for x, we add 66 to both sides of the equation:

x = 28 + 66
x = 94

The charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%.

The final answer is: 94"
"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and her hourly tips are $15. So, her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Now, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. 

20% of $10,000 is 0.2 * $10,000 = $2000.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000. 

To do this, we divide the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000). 

$2000 / $1000 = 2.

So, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying the other fruits. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he has already purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Now, let's calculate how many plums he can buy with the remaining money:
Plums cost $0.25 each, so the number of plums he can buy is $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say the number of large stuffed animals sold is L and the number of small stuffed animals sold is S.

We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so S = 2L.

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total amount earned from the sales is $120. The total amount earned from the sales is the sum of the amount earned from large stuffed animals and the amount earned from small stuffed animals. The amount earned from large stuffed animals is the number of large stuffed animals sold multiplied by the price of a large stuffed animal, which is L * $12. The amount earned from small stuffed animals is the number of small stuffed animals sold multiplied by the price of a small stuffed animal, which is S * $4.

So, we can write the equation: L * $12 + S * $4 = $120.

Since S = 2L, we can substitute S with 2L in the equation: L * $12 + 2L * $4 = $120.

Combine like terms: L * $12 + $8L = $120.

Combine the L terms: ($12 + $8)L = $120.

Simplify the equation: $20L = $120.

Divide both sides by $20: L = $120 / $20.

L = 6.

Since S = 2L, S = 2 * 6.

S = 12.

"To find out how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we first need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. He can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe, so with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day.

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. So, with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Now, we know that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day, we multiply 36 pounds by 40: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds.

Since there are 30 days in a month, we multiply 1440 pounds by 30 to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The ratio for the first package is 3/2, and for the second package is 6/4. We can simplify these ratios to 3/2 and 3/2, which means the price increases by a factor of 1.5 for each additional sandwich. 

Since the first package has 2 sandwiches and the second package has 4 sandwiches, the price of the second package is 1.5 times the price of the first package. 

The price of the second package is $6, and the price of the first package is $3. So, the price of the second package is 6/3 = 2 times the price of the first package. This confirms our ratio of 1.5.

Now, we can use this ratio to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches. The price of the package with 8 sandwiches will be 4 times the price of the second package (since 8 is 2 times 4). 

The price of the package with 8 sandwiches is 4 * 6 = $24.

$3000 (total cost) - $1000 (amount he paid) = $2000 (remaining amount)

Since he has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we need to convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 
10% = 10 / 100 = 0.1

Now, we multiply the remaining amount by the decimal to find the monthly payment: 
$2000 * 0.1 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 x 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so she released 6 yellow balloons, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 x 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's add up the remaining balloons: 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons. 

15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

The final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 34."
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). However, this scenario is dependent on the normal teacher not giving an extension, which has a 60% chance (100% - 40%). So, the probability of this scenario is 20% * 60% = 12%.

The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these three scenarios: 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since the total probability must be 100%. This means we need to subtract the total probability of not having to turn in his homework from 100% to find the probability of having to turn in his homework.

The probability of not having to turn in his homework is 102% - 100% = 2%. However, this is not possible since the probability cannot be greater than 100%. This means we need to subtract 100% from 102% to get a negative number, which is not possible. However, we can subtract 100% from 102% to get -2% and then subtract -2% from 100% to get 102%.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we first need to find out how many seats are available for guests. 

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300
Total seats taken: 950 + 300 = 1250
Seats available for guests: 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Now, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive. 

Number of graduates: 950
Seats available for guests: 4750
Tickets per graduate: 4750 / 950 = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up.
2. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. So, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.
3. Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, we can set up a proportion to find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans.

Let's say x is the number of small beans equivalent to 1 medium-sized bean. Then, 3x is the number of small beans equivalent to 1 medium-sized bean. Since 150 medium-sized beans is equivalent to eating 150 * 3 small beans, we can set up the equation:

150 * 3 = x

To find x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 150 * 3 / 3
x = 150

So, 1 medium-sized bean is equivalent to 150 small beans. Since Grandpa can eat 150 medium-sized beans, he can eat 150 * 150 small beans.

The final answer is: 22500"
"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses. 

Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so her total hours worked is 6 * 3 = 18 hours. 

Her total earnings are $15 per day for 3 days, so her total earnings are 15 * 3 = $45.

Her total expenses are $3 per day for 3 days, so her total expenses are 3 * 3 = $9.

Now, we subtract her total expenses from her total earnings to find her net earnings: 45 - 9 = $36.

To find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by her total hours worked: 36 / 18 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils, then add them together.

The cost of the books is 3 * 16 = 48 dollars.

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to find out how many bottles of soda he will place along the driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the number of bottles, we divide the total width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next:

8 bottles * 5 seconds per bottle = 40 seconds

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many packs Uncle Franky can make, we need to first find out how many apples he has in total. Since he ordered two boxes and each box has 40 apples, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box.

2 boxes * 40 apples/box = 80 apples

Now, we need to find out how many packs of 8 apples he can make with 80 apples. We divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack.

80 apples / 8 apples/pack = 10 packs

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples."
"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract that from the initial amount of money she had.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 x $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 x $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor starts with $50, so subtracting the total cost of the cheese from that amount, we get:
$50 - $40 = $10.

So, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jim gets $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years, so the total amount of loans is:
$50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000

He also lost money by not working for 4 years. His income before college was $25,000 per year, so the total amount of money lost is:
$25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000

The total amount of money Jim needs to earn is the sum of the loans and the money lost:
$200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000

After college, his income triples, so his new income is:
$25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year

To find out how long it will take Jim to earn the total amount of $300,000, we can divide the total amount by his new income:
$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years

So, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces. 

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. The fabric pieces need to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. 

So, the length of the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet and the width will be 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

Now, we can calculate the area of one fabric piece: 
Area = length * width = 8 * 10 = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two fabric pieces, we multiply the area by 2: 
Total area = 2 * 80 = 160 square feet

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102. 
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 
5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209. 
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add up the number of letters delivered each day: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The final answer is: 736"

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.
The cost of the pasta salad is 6 people * $6 per person = $36.

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad together: $65 + $36 = $101.

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101."
"To find the average amount Johnny's dad lost, we need to calculate the total amount lost and divide it by the number of races.

On the first race, he lost $5.
On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost, so he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.
On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race, so he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

The total amount lost is $5 + $16.50 = $21.50.
The number of races is 3.

The average amount lost is $21.50 / 3 = $7.17.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet, which is equal to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole's initial height was 50 inches and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's denote the share of the first person as x.

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

The share of the first person is $420."
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

First, let's convert 3 weeks to days: 3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to find the fraction of a day in hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 of a day is (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x / 2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

Combine like terms:

2.5x + 4 = 19

Subtract 4 from both sides:

2.5x = 15

Divide both sides by 2.5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

First set = x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

Initial price of the car = $20,000
Depreciation rate = 21% per year

Year 2008:
Price in 2008 = Initial price - (Initial price * depreciation rate)
= $20,000 - ($20,000 * 0.21)
= $20,000 - $4,200
= $15,800

Year 2009:
Price in 2009 = Price in 2008 - (Price in 2008 * depreciation rate)
= $15,800 - ($15,800 * 0.21)
= $15,800 - $3,328
= $12,472

Year 2010:
Price in 2010 = Price in 2009 - (Price in 2009 * depreciation rate)
= $12,472 - ($12,472 * 0.21)
= $12,472 - $2,620.32
= $9,851.68

The price of the car in 2010 is $9,851.68."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to find the total number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

10% of the books are written in German, so that's 10% of 50, which is 0.1 x 50 = 5 books in German.

The total number of books written in English and German is 25 + 5 = 30.

Since there are 50 books in total, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20.

"To find out how many gallons Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. 
So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups.

Now, we need to convert cups to gallons. 
There are 16 cups in a gallon. 
So, to find out how many gallons, we divide the total cups by 16. 
240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Initially, Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
120 + 20 = 140

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100) board the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
140 - 50 + 100 = 190

At the third station, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
190 - 80 = 110

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"To find the total amount Alison spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

1. The tank top cost $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: 
$10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55.

The final answer is: $55"
"To find the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, we need to find the area of one tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of one tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Now, we need to find the total number of tiles required to cover the kitchen floor. Since the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt and each tile covers 1 SqFt, we need 200 tiles.

The cost of each tile is $12. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of tiles by the cost of each tile: 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 is 0.6 x $120 = $72. 

The increased cost is $120 + $72 = $192 per month.

To find the yearly cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12. 

$192 x 12 = $2304.

The final answer is: $2304"
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since a twin bed has 1 set of sheets and a king size bed has 1 set of sheets, the total number of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 + 1 = 5.

Since he can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 1, which is 2. This means he can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, which is a total of 4 sheets at a time.

Now, we divide the total number of sheets by the number of sheets he can wash at a time: 5 sheets / 4 sheets per load = 1.25 loads. However, since we can't have a fraction of a load, we round up to the nearest whole number. 

So, in a week, Greg does 2 loads of laundry.

To find out how many loads of laundry he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads he does in a week by the number of weeks in a year: 2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads/year.

The final answer is: 104"
"To find the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and multiply it by 4.

They watch 4 movies on Saturday. 
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

To find the total number of movies they watch in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of movies they watch in one weekend by 4: 
6 * 4 = 24

- Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
- Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers.
- This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year.

Since Leo collected 50 stickers last year, this year he collected 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

To find the total number of stickers Leo has now, we need to add the stickers he had two years ago, the stickers he collected last year, and the stickers he collected this year.

Total stickers = 100 (initial stickers) + 50 (last year's stickers) + 100 (this year's stickers)
Total stickers = 250

"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount of cat food each cat eats per day (60 grams).

First, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food each cat eats per day. Since Imma has 3 cats and each cat eats 60 grams of food twice a day, we multiply 60 grams by 2 to get 120 grams per cat per day.

Now, we multiply the amount of food each cat eats per day by the number of cats: 120 grams * 3 cats = 360 grams per day.

Now, we divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount of cat food used per day (360 grams): 720 grams / 360 grams = 2.

The cat food will last for 2 days."

"Let's denote the time Donovan took as D and the time Betsy took as B. We know that B = D + 18 and the total time is 98 minutes, so D + B = 98.

Substituting B = D + 18 into the second equation, we get D + (D + 18) = 98.

Combine like terms: 2D + 18 = 98.

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2D = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: D = 40.

Since B = D + 18, B = 40 + 18 = 58.

"To find out how many emails James responds to, we first need to find out how many emails he doesn't respond to. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 x 80 = 16 emails. 

So, James doesn't respond to 16 emails. 

To find out how many emails he responds to, we subtract the number of emails he doesn't respond to from the total number of emails. 

80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Since James responds to 64 emails per day, we need to multiply this number by 5 to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week.

64 x 5 = 320 emails.

"To find out how many pizzas are left, we first need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 is 0.7 x 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. 
They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 x 40 = 32 pizzas.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 = 3500 cents.

He also wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, which is 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons together: 3500 + 21000 = 23500 cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert 23500 cents to dollars by dividing by 100: 23500 / 100 = 235 dollars.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we need to find out how many bananas the first two monkeys eat in total per day. 

First monkey eats 10 bananas per day
Second monkey eats 14 bananas per day
Total bananas eaten by first two monkeys = 10 + 14 = 24 bananas per day

"To find out how much Jenny paid for the roses, we need to determine if she bought the roses by the dozen or individually. Since she bought 15 roses, it's more cost-effective to buy them by the dozen. 

15 roses is 1 and 3 roses. 1 dozen is 12 roses, so she bought 1 dozen and 3 individual roses. 

1 dozen roses cost $15. 3 individual roses cost 3 * $2 = $6. So the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. 

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

"To find out how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time he needs to wait for the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station. Since the first train leaves at 30 minutes, the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.

3. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

4. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station. Since the second train leaves at 65 minutes, the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes.

5. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

6. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. Since the third train leaves at 125 minutes, the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long Paul needs to wait for the fourth train. Since the current time is not given, we assume it is 0 minutes. Paul will wait from 0 to 145 minutes for the fourth train.

"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to first find out how many inches it grows per year. 

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find the growth rate per year, we divide the total growth by the number of years: 
8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year.

Now that we know the growth rate per year, we can multiply this rate by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years:
2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:

- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the earnings from each type of bike to find the total earnings:

$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck, then subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

So, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field.

12"
"To find out how many minutes John spends in class, we first need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class per day. 

There are 6 periods in a day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes per day is 6 * 40 = 240 minutes.

Since John goes to class for 5 days a week, the total minutes spent in class per week is 240 * 5 = 1200 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the extra minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these two days. 

First, we need to find out the total minutes in a week. There are 7 days in a week, and there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, the total minutes in a week is 7 * 60 * 24 = 10080 minutes.

Now, we can find 1/16 of the total minutes in a week: 10080 / 16 = 630 minutes.

Since John spends this 630 minutes on Saturday and Sunday, we need to add this to his total minutes spent in class. 

Total minutes spent in class and extra learning time per week = 1200 + 630 = 1830 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1830 / 60 = 30.5 hours.

The final answer is: 30.5"
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is the height of the third floor, which is 24 feet.

The height of the ball after the first bounce is 2/3 of the initial height:
(2/3) * 24 = 16 feet

The height of the ball after the second bounce is 2/3 of the height after the first bounce:
(2/3) * 16 = 10.67 feet

The final answer is: 10.67"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches. 

The first child is 6 feet tall, which is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10).

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"To find the original weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the 270 kilograms left after the Allosaurus ate.

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which was half of what was left after the velociraptors ate. 

Let's call the weight left after the velociraptors ate ""x"". Since the Allosaurus ate half of this, we can set up the equation: x / 2 = 270.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = 270 * 2 = 540.

Now, we know that the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Let's call the weight left after the T-Rex ate ""y"". Since the velociraptors ate half of this, we can set up the equation: y / 2 = 540.

To solve for y, we multiply both sides by 2: y = 540 * 2 = 1080.

Now, we know that the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. Let's call the original weight of the triceratops ""z"". Since the T-Rex ate half of this, we can set up the equation: z / 2 = 1080.

To solve for z, we multiply both sides by 2: z = 1080 * 2 = 2160.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint to find out how many gallons are needed. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet. 
The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet. 
The total area of the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so 3 were shaken and 9 were unshaken. Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 1 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 7 sodas in total, with 1 shaken and 6 unshaken. The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans.

Probability = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of cans)
Probability = 1 / 7

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Probability = (1 / 7) * 100
Probability = 14.29%

The final answer is: 14.29"
"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

To find the total distance between the two trains, we add the distances traveled by each train: 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of days Billy helps, we first need to find the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

Now, we subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy helps. 
50 - 10 = 40

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so we need to find the total number of hours he works in a day. 
3 hours/day * 2 people/hour = 6 people/day

Now, we multiply the number of days Billy helps by the number of people he can help per day. 
40 days * 6 people/day = 240 people

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people that were present.

First, let's calculate the total number of people that were transported by the buses:
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people that were transported by the cars:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the total number of people present is the sum of the people inside the church and the people outside, we can assume that the number of people outside is the sum of the number of cars and buses, which is 20 + 12 = 32 people.

Now, let's subtract the number of people outside from the total number of people present to find the number of people inside the church:
Total people present = number of people outside + number of people inside the church
Total people present = 32 people + number of people inside the church
Number of people inside the church = Total people present - number of people outside
Number of people inside the church = 32 people + number of people inside the church - 32 people
Number of people inside the church = 32 people + (Total people present - 32 people)
Number of people inside the church = 32 people + (480 people - 32 people)
Number of people inside the church = 32 people + 448 people
Number of people inside the church = 480 people

However, this is the total number of people present, not the number of people inside the church. To find the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the number of people transported by the buses and the cars from the total number of people present. However, we already know that the number of people transported by the buses and the cars is 480 people. Therefore, the number of people inside the church is the total number of people present minus the number of people transported by the buses and the cars.

Number of people inside the church = Total people present - number of people transported
Number of people inside the church = 32 people + 448 people - 480 people
Number of people inside the church = 480 people - 32 people
Number of people inside the church = 448 people

The final answer is: 448"

"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 
The total time spent on breaks is 2 * 15 = 30 minutes.
The total time spent per day is 30 (lunch) + 30 (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 60 / 60 = 1 hour.

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. 
After 5 days, the total time spent is 1 * 5 = 5 hours.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now that we know Micah ran 28 miles, we can subtract the miles Amber and Micah ran from the total miles to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Total miles = 52
Amber's miles = 8
Micah's miles = 28
Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after returning the $15.00 item and then add that to the initial charge.

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. Return: -$15.00 (since she returned an item)
   New balance: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

3. Frying pan: 20% off $20.00
   Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
   Price of frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

4. Towels: 10% off $30.00
   Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
   Price of towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

5. Total cost of new purchases: $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

6. New balance: $70.00 (previous balance) + $43.00 (new purchases) = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Let's break down the information given:

- A fifth of the jellyfish are large.
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
- The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue.
- When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. 
A third of the large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, so x/15 = 6. 

To find the total number of jellyfish, we need to solve for x:
x/15 = 6
x = 6 * 15
x = 90

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for her retirement. 

First, let's calculate her annual expenses in retirement: 40% of $100,000 is 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000.

Since she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, her total expenses will be $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

Lauren saves 20% of her current salary, which is 0.2 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

To find out how many years she needs to work to save $800,000, we can divide the total amount needed by the amount she saves per year: $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for her retirement, but we are asked how many more years she needs to work. Since she hasn't started working yet, the answer is the total number of years.

"To find out how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

To find out how many days it will take her to hike 9,300 miles, we divide the total miles by the miles per day: 9,300 / 250 = 37.2 days.

Since Soledad only has 30 days in June, she will not be able to complete her journey on time. To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract the number of days she has from the number of days it will take her to complete the journey: 37.2 - 30 = 7.2 days.

Since she can only hike twice a day, we need to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day. We multiply the number of extra days by the number of hikes per day: 7.2 * 2 = 14.4 miles.

However, since you can't hike a fraction of a mile, we round up to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we are looking for the exact number of miles she needs to hike per day to complete her journey on time."

"To find the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers, we first need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour and the 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour produce a total of 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour produce a total of 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour.

So, the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers per hour is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since they work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers is 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, and the total number of toys ordered is 400. So, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Since the 4 workers produce 200 toys, the fifth worker must produce the remaining toys. The fifth worker produces 380 - 200 = 180 toys in 10 hours.

To find the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked: 180 / 10 = 18.

1. Kris had 7 stickers, and before that, Luis had given Kris the remaining stickers after keeping some for himself. Since Kris kept 9 stickers, Luis must have given Kris 7 + 9 = 16 stickers.

2. Since Luis used half of the stickers he received from Seth and gave the rest to Kris, Luis must have had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers before giving some to Kris.

3. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis must have had 32 stickers, which is half of what Seth had initially. To find out how many stickers Seth had initially, we multiply 32 by 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{64}$"
"To find the total number of M&M's, we need to multiply the number of large bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that by the number of M&M's per ounce. 

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Since John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, we need to divide the total number of M&M's by 10 to find the number of small bags.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to first calculate half of the circumference of the earth. 

Half of the circumference of the earth is 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km.

Since Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, we can find the number of days it will take him to fly 20,000 km by dividing 20,000 km by 400 km/day.

20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the speed of the fastest car, we need to first find the speed of the 2nd fastest car. 

The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, which is 120 miles per hour. 

Speed of the 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.

The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. 

Speed of the fastest car = 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Liam is 16 years old now. Two years ago, Liam's age was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. This means that Vince's age two years ago was 14 / 2 = 7 years old.

To find Vince's current age, we need to add 2 years to his age two years ago. Vince's current age is 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's call this number A. 
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. 
   Let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted S. Then, Camden painted S + 12 eggs.
   We know that S + (S + 12) = 30, because together they painted 30 eggs.
   Combining like terms, we get 2S + 12 = 30.
   Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get 2S = 18.
   Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 9.
   So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.
3. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, 
   the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is 56 - 30 = 26.
   Since they painted the same number of eggs, each of them painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.
4. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. 
   The difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold is 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes separately.

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and Nik has 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces and Nik has 200 crayons, he will need 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

The total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 200 (crayons) + 200 (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, the total weight in pounds is 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to calculate 80% of 80 feet. 

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet, we need to divide the total feet by 4 to find the number of logs.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks, so we multiply the number of logs by 5.

16 * 5 = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 * 1.2 = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Valerie earns $5000 per month.
2. Valerie's brother earns 2 times what Valerie earns, so he earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.
3. Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.
4. Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.
5. To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

The time spent on the beach is 40 minutes, and the distance covered on the beach is 2 miles. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed to find the speed on the beach.

Time on the beach = 2 miles / x miles/minute = 40 minutes
x = 2 miles / 40 minutes
x = 1/20 miles/minute

Now that we know the speed on the beach, we can find the speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles/minute.

The time spent on the sidewalk is 1 mile / (1/10 miles/minute) = 10 minutes.

The total time spent walking is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk: 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60. This is 60 - 32 = $28.

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the amount she needs to save ($28) by the amount she saves per week ($4) to find out how many more weeks it will take: 28 / 4 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree. 

3 trees had 7 blue birds each, so that's 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.
2 trees had 4 blue birds each, so that's 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.
1 tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add them all together: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles and has 60 marbles, we need to find out how many marbles he had initially. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24.

So, if Bob receives 24 more marbles and has 60 marbles, we can set up an equation to find the initial number of marbles he had:

Initial marbles + 24 = 60

To find the initial number of marbles, we need to subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

Initial marbles = 60 - 24
Initial marbles = 36

Now that we know Bob had 36 marbles initially, we need to find out how many marbles he will have if he loses 10 marbles. To do this, we subtract 10 from the initial number of marbles:

36 - 10 = 26

So, Bob will have 26 marbles if he loses 10 of the marbles he has.

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle. 

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the two temperatures multiplied by the total ounces. 

The total ounces of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle).

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of cows:

Initial number of cows = 50
Cows brought by Milkie Cows Limited per day = 20
Number of days in three weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days
Total cows brought by Milkie Cows Limited = 20 * 21 = 420
Total number of cows = 50 + 420 = 470

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens:

Initial number of chickens = 20
Chickens brought by Broilers Limited per day = 10
Total chickens brought by Broilers Limited = 10 * 21 = 210
Total number of chickens = 20 + 210 = 230

Now, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm:

Total number of animals = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
= 470 + 230

"To find the total cost of the bagels, we need to first calculate the original price of 4 packs of bagels. 

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs will cost 4 x $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00 to find the discount amount. 

10% of $40.00 = 0.10 x $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the final cost of the 4 packs of bagels.

$40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, we need to find the total number of bagels in 4 packs.

4 packs x 9 bagels per pack = 4 x 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the final cost of the 4 packs by the total number of bagels.

$36.00 ÷ 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

"To find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate, we first need to determine how many scoops 1 less than 3 scoops is. 

1 less than 3 scoops is 3 - 1 = 2 scoops.

Now, we know it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

3 less than 6 potatoes is 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes.

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

To find out how many scoops Gomer ate, we need to know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. 

5 less than 23 scoops is 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, we know it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to divide the number of scoops by 2 and then multiply by 3.

18 scoops / 2 = 9
9 * 3 = 27

"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.

240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the information given. 

There are 17 green jellybeans. 
There are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, so there are 2 * 17 = 34 red jellybeans. 
The total number of green and red jellybeans is 17 + 34 = 51 jellybeans. 
Since there are a total of 60 jellybeans, the number of blue jellybeans is 60 - 51 = 9 jellybeans.

"To find out how many lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the total number of lemons he collects in one year and then multiply it by 10.

First, let's find out how many lemons Tim collects in one year. He has 5 trees and each tree gives him 6 lemons per year. 

5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

Now, we multiply the number of lemons he collects in one year by 10 to find out how many lemons he collects in a decade.

30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. Let's assume the common multiple is x. So, the total number of men is 5x and the total number of women is 9x.

We know that the total number of passengers on the bus is 84. Therefore, 5x + 9x = 84.

Combine like terms: 14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14: x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the total number of women on the bus initially: 9x = 9 * 6 = 54

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is: 54 - 20 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The cost of a sunflower is $2.
- The cost of a bouquet is $8, which contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earns $26 from sunflowers per day.
- Faraday earns $56 from bouquets per day.

First, let's find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold per day. Since he earns $26 from sunflowers per day, and each sunflower costs $2, we can divide the earnings by the cost of a sunflower to find the number of sunflowers sold per day:

$26 (earnings from sunflowers) / $2 (cost of a sunflower) = 13 sunflowers per day

Next, let's find out how many bouquets Faraday sold per day. Since he earns $56 from bouquets per day, and each bouquet costs $8, we can divide the earnings by the cost of a bouquet to find the number of bouquets sold per day:

$56 (earnings from bouquets) / $8 (cost of a bouquet) = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, we can multiply the number of bouquets sold per day by the number of sunflowers per bouquet to find the total number of sunflowers sold from bouquets per day:

7 bouquets per day * 12 sunflowers per bouquet = 84 sunflowers per day from bouquets

Now, let's find the total number of sunflowers sold per day by adding the number of sunflowers sold directly and the number of sunflowers sold from bouquets:

13 sunflowers per day + 84 sunflowers per day = 97 sunflowers per day

Finally, let's multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by the number of days to find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days:

97 sunflowers per day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers

The final answer is: 291"
"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference between the two.

First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide $100 by $5:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Now, Adam sells 60% of his 20 rocks. To find 60% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.6:

20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks

Since Adam sells each rock for $7, we multiply the number of rocks sold by the selling price:

12 rocks * $7/rock = $84

Now, let's find the total cost of the rocks. Adam bought 20 rocks for $5 each:

20 rocks * $5/rock = $100

Since Adam only sells 12 rocks, he has 8 rocks left. He still has to pay for these rocks, so we add the cost of the unsold rocks to the cost of the sold rocks:

$100 (cost of sold rocks) + $40 (cost of unsold rocks) = $140

Now, we find the total revenue from selling 12 rocks:

$84 (revenue from sold rocks)

To find the loss, we subtract the total revenue from the total cost:

$140 (total cost) - $84 (total revenue) = $56

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of large, medium, and small-sized picture scenes Lauren needs to draw. 

First, let's find the LCM of 45, 36, and 49. 

The prime factorization of 45 is 3^2 * 5.
The prime factorization of 36 is 2^2 * 3^2.
The prime factorization of 49 is 7^2.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
LCM(45, 36, 49) = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5 * 7^2 = 4 * 9 * 5 * 49 = 8820.

Now, let's find out how many days it will take Lauren to draw each type of picture scene:
- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 / 5 = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 / 6 = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 / 7 = 7 days

The LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of all three numbers, so it will take Lauren at least 8820 / 5 = 1764 days to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes, 8820 / 6 = 1470 days to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes, and 8820 / 7 = 1260 days to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes. However, since the LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of all three numbers, the actual number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project is the LCM of the number of days it takes her to draw each type of picture scene.

The LCM of 9, 6, and 7 is 126. 

Therefore, it will take Lauren 126 days to complete the project.

The final answer is: 126"
"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children.

Chatty prepared three dozen eggs. Since one dozen is equal to 12, three dozen eggs would be 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total cost of food for one month. 

First, we need to find out how many days are in May. May has 31 days. 

Since each fish needs $1 worth of food a day, and Jen has 3 fish, the total cost per day is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

So, Jen spends $93 on food for her fish in May.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.2 in decimal form. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 times 0.2, which is 0.6.

To find the probability of both tickets winning, we multiply the probabilities: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). 
So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, Mason eats 5 carrots each day. 
So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, let's add the total number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays and the weekend: 
20 (weekdays) + 10 (weekend) = 30.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (which is the decimal form of 60%).

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now we have the lengths of both songs: 5 minutes for the first song and 8 minutes for the second song. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the profit from each day and then add them together.

On Monday, Linus bought 2 devices for $20 each. So, the total cost for Monday is 2 * $20 = $40. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the total revenue for Monday is 2 * $40 = $80. The profit for Monday is $80 - $40 = $40.

On Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each. So, the total cost for Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the total revenue for Tuesday is 4 * $40 = $160. The profit for Tuesday is $160 - $80 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Since each juice can cover 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of 1 person's daily energy demand, Hortex would need 100% / 20% = 5 bottles.

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the current production from the required production: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

The final answer is: 7300"
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Since Carla has 8 babies and 3/4 of them wear purple, the number of babies wearing purple is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

Now, 1/4 of the babies wear blue, so the number of babies wearing blue is 1/4 * 8 = 2.

The number of babies wearing blue and bows is 2. 

The number of babies wearing purple and bows is 1/3 of the purple babies, which is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

Now, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4.

The percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is (number of purple babies wearing bows / total number of babies wearing bows) * 100 = (2 / 4) * 100 = 50%.

"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he earned from selling the land.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. 

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. 

So, the total amount of land sold so far is 40 + 20 = 60 square meters.

Abraham has 80 - 60 = 20 square meters left.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $60 from the last sale.

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400:
60% of 400 = 0.6 * 400 = 240
Total apartments in the last complex = 400 + 240 = 640
Total apartments in all complexes = 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is:

- Year 3 (7 years old): 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- Year 4 (8 years old): 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, but we don't know the production of a 10-year-old tree yet, so we'll come back to this.
- Year 5 (9 years old): 0 fruits
- Year 6 (10 years old): 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's find the production of an 8-year-old tree. Since an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, and a 10-year-old tree produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

- Year 4 (8 years old): 800 fruits

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. 

We know that R = 4B and B = Y - 7. 

We also know that R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting R = 4B into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Substituting B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37, we get 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides to get 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6 to get Y = 12.

Now that we know Y, we can find B by substituting Y = 12 into the equation B = Y - 7, which gives B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B, we can find R by substituting B = 5 into the equation R = 4B, which gives R = 4 * 5 = 20.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Ronnie was given x dollars. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3x dollars.

Initially, Ronnie had x dollars and Rissa had 3x dollars.

After they gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's say y dollars, Ronnie will have x - y dollars and Rissa will have 3x - y dollars.

According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

3x - y = (4/5)(3x)

To solve for y, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

15x - 5y = 12x

Now, let's isolate y:

5y = 15x - 12x
5y = 3x
y = (3/5)x

Now that we know y, we can find out how much money Ronnie has left. We know that Ronnie gave y dollars to their little sister, so Ronnie has x - y dollars left.

x - y = x - (3/5)x
= (2/5)x

Now, we need to find the value of x. We know that Ronnie was given $5, so x = 5.

(2/5)x = (2/5)(5)
= 2

So, Ronnie has $2 left."
"Let's break down the information given:

- There are four colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow.
- There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
- Half the mural is yellow.
- The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is the combination of red, white, and purple paint. Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as x. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the total amount of these three colors is 3x.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow. So, the other half is 6 pints (since 12 / 2 = 6). This 6 pints is the combination of red, white, and purple paint, which is 3x.

We can set up the equation: 3x = 6

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 6 / 3
x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and we know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is also x, which is 2 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas together: 960 (bedrooms) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 3160 square feet.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which means he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he has 20 bills left, and each bill is worth $20, he has 20 * 20 = $400. Tripling this amount gives him 3 * 400 = $1200.

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has $1200, he needs 1200 / 5 = 240 5 dollar bills.

The final answer is: 240"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how many days he can use the chalk after Monday.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk, which is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches. 

Now, the remaining chalk is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

The teacher will recycle the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. To find out how many days he can use the chalk, we need to divide the remaining chalk by the amount he uses each day (20% of the original 5-inch piece).

20% of 5 inches is 0.2 * 5 = 1 inch.

Now, we divide the remaining chalk by the amount used each day: 2.75 / 1 = 2.75 days.

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to find the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4. 
One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

Since there are 12 boys and 12 girls in total, the total number of students is 12 + 12 = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to first determine how many face masks Mike bought, which is 5. 

Then, we need to calculate three times the number of face masks Mike bought, which is 3 * 5 = 15.

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to first find the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth. 
The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

The percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%.

= 1600 gallons

Since the cost per gallon is $3.5, the total refund will be the cost of 1600 gallons.

Total refund = 1600 * $3.5
= $5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Colin's current age as C and Wendy's current age as W.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for C.

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

20 = C

"Let's break down the events step by step:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree. Newton picked up 2 apples, so he had 2 apples.
2. He put 1 apple in his pocket, leaving him with 1 apple. Then, he threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 1 (from the initial 2) + 5 (from the tree) = 6 apples.
3. He put all but 1 of these 6 apples in his pocket, leaving him with 1 apple. So, he has 1 apple.
4. He threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 1 (from the previous step) + 6 (from the tree) = 7 apples.
5. He picked up all the remaining apples, so he now has 7 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 7 apples."
"To find the total cost of Ali's order, we need to calculate the number of bags of coal he ordered and multiply it by the cost per bag.

Number of bags = Total weight of coal / Weight per bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg

Now, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
= 17 * $18
= $306

The final answer is: $306"
"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza her friends will eat. 

For cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is 6 * 6 = 36. 

For pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 4 * 6 = 24.

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find out how many whole pizzas are needed for each type. 

For cheese pizza, 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas. 

For pepperoni pizza, 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, she needs a total of 3 + 3 = 6 pizzas. 

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total miles Sam ran, we need to add the miles he ran on each day. 

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So, the total miles he ran on these days is 3 * 3 = 9 miles.

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So, the total miles he ran on these days is 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days: 9 + 10 = 19 miles.

The final answer is: 19"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many snowballs Jay builds and how many melt in a given time frame. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is 60 minutes. So, in 15 minutes, he builds 20 * (15/60) = 5 snowballs. 

In 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt. 

Let's calculate the net number of snowballs Jay has after 15 minutes: 5 (built) - 2 (melted) = 3 snowballs.

Now, let's find out how many 15-minute intervals it will take to reach 60 snowballs. We can do this by dividing 60 by the net number of snowballs Jay has after each 15-minute interval, which is 3.

60 / 3 = 20 intervals of 15 minutes.

Since each interval is 15 minutes, we multiply the number of intervals by 15 to find the total time: 20 * 15 = 300 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 300 / 60 = 5 hours.

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Since Digimon had its 20th anniversary, we can assume that the year it came out is 20 years ago. 

Let's denote John's age at that time as 'x'. Since John was twice as old as Jim at that time, Jim's age at that time would be 'x/2'.

Now, we know that John is 28 years old now. To find his age 20 years ago, we need to subtract 20 from 28. 

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8

Since John's age 20 years ago was 'x', we can set up the equation: x = 8

Now, we know that Jim's age 20 years ago was 'x/2'. Since x = 8, Jim's age 20 years ago was 8/2 = 4.

To find Jim's current age, we need to add 20 to his age 20 years ago. 

Jim's current age = 4 + 20 = 24

So, Jim is 24 years old now."
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Doxa ate 1 slice. 
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. 
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices eaten, we need to add the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother. 
Total slices eaten = Doxa's slices + sister's slices + brother's slices 
Total slices eaten = 1 + 2 + 3 
Total slices eaten = 6

"Let's break down the information given:

- On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
- On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages (since 50 / 2 = 25).
- They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x. 

After the first day, they had x - 38 + 50 bandages (since they ordered 1 pack of 50).
After the second day, they had (x - 38 + 50) - 28 bandages.
After the third day, they had ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) + 100 (since they ordered 2 packs of 50) - 25 bandages.

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78

Simplifying the equation:

x - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78
x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides:

x = 21

The initial number of bandages they started with on the first day is 21."
"To find the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut first. 

The initial length of her hair was 10 inches, and the final length was 8 inches. So, the length of hair cut off is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

Since the cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, the total cost of the haircut is 2 * $30 = $60.

The cost of the color is $40.

So, the total cost of the haircut and color is $60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100.

So, total hours worked in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours.

Now, let's calculate her total earnings from her hourly rate. 
Her hourly rate is $1.5. 
Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270.

Since Jen has complete attendance, she will receive an additional $10. 
Total earnings = $270 + $10 = $280.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let x be the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The problem states that ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8.

We are told that this expression is equal to 40, so we can set up the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of one jelly bean.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans he guessed.

However, we don't know the number of red jelly beans Tim guessed.  To find the number of red jelly beans Tim guessed, we need to know the total number of jelly beans he guessed.  We can find the total number of jelly beans he guessed by dividing the volume of the jar by the volume of one jelly bean and then multiplying by 0.3.

Total number of jelly beans Tim guessed = (0.8 * 540) / 0.15 * 0.3
Total number of jelly beans Tim guessed = 864

Number of red jelly beans Tim guessed = Total number of jelly beans Tim guessed * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans Tim guessed = 864 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans Tim guessed = 259.2

The difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans Tim guessed is 900 - 259.2 = 640.8."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people.

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first stop, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for the first 5 years and the cost of visits for the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 2 * 3 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 6 * 5 = $30.

The cost of one visit increased by 150% after 5 years. A 150% increase means the new cost is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = $5. The annual cost for the next 3 years is 5 * 3 = $15. For 3 years, the total cost is 15 * 3 = $45.

The total cost for all visits is the sum of the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years: 30 + 45 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups and the total time required for all students to participate.

There are 4 grades (4-7) with 10 students in each grade, so the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find the total number of groups: 40 / 8 = 5.

Each group uses 45 minutes to try and escape, so the total time required for all students to participate is the number of groups multiplied by the time per group: 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the tables and the total cost of the roof frames, then add them together.

The cost of the tables is 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.
The cost of the roof frames is 2 frames * $10 per frame = $20.

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames together: $80 + $20 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"Let's break down the problem. 

Let the length of the shorter piece be x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is 40 feet. 

We can write an equation to represent this: x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms: 5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5: x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet, we can find the length of the longer piece by multiplying 8 by 4: 4x = 4(8) = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of ground beef

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef, we can multiply the total pounds of meat by the amount of seasoning per pound to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

5 pounds of ground beef * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the number of windows by the width of each window. 

Number of windows: 5
Width of each window: 35 inches

Total width of windows = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width of windows = 5 * 35
Total width of windows = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the total width by 2.

Fabric needed = 2 * Total width of windows
Fabric needed = 2 * 175
Fabric needed = 350 inches

"Let's break down the information given. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If we let the number of cupcakes be 'c', then the number of brownies is 3c - 2.

Since each person gets 2 treats and there are 5 people in the class, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10.

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12.

Divide by 4: c = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount, and then add the cost of the nail art.

The original cost of the manicure and pedicure is $35 + $40 = $75.

The discount is 20% of $75, which is 0.2 x $75 = $15.

So, the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers, the total cost of the nail art is 10 x $3 = $30.

The total cost is the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of the nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"

1. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley.
2. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim.
3. Samantha has 27 paintings.

From point 1, we know that Shelley has 12 more paintings than Samantha. Since Samantha has 27 paintings, Shelley must have 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.

From point 2, we know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. Since Shelley has 39 paintings, Kim must have 39 - 8 = 31 paintings.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to calculate the price after each discount.

In November, the price of the toy was $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.8 (100% + 80% = 180%, or 1 + 1.8 = 2.8, or 1 + 80/100 = 1.8, or 1 + 0.8 = 1.8, or 1.8 as a decimal).

Price in December = $40 * 1.8 = $72

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we multiply the price in December by 0.5 (100% - 50% = 50%, or 1 - 0.5 = 0.5, or 50% as a decimal).

Price in January = $72 * 0.5 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the standard lessons and the veteran lessons separately, then add them together.

For the standard lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. So, the total amount from standard lessons is 4 * $80 = $320.

For the veteran lessons, Charlie reduces his rate by 25%. This means he charges 75% of his standard rate, which is 0.75 * $80 = $60 per hour. He has 2 lessons at this rate, so the total amount from veteran lessons is 2 * $60 = $120.

Now, we add the total amount from standard lessons and veteran lessons: $320 + $120 = $440.

"Let's break down the problem. Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the original amount. 

To find 1/4 of the original amount, we multiply 20 by 1/4. 

20 * 1/4 = 20 * 0.25 = 5

This means Eve is left with 5 pieces of pomelos. Since she originally had 20, the number of pomelos she gave away is the difference between the original amount and the amount she has left.

20 - 5 = 15

So, Eve gave away 15 pieces of pomelos.

"To find out how many apples Walter ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60. 

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 apples.

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, we need to find out how many apples were left. 

60 - 24 = 36 apples.

Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. 

25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9 apples.

Now, we need to find out how many apples are left after giving 9 to his sister.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books that one bookcase can hold: 
10 (middle shelf) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 45 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases are required to hold all of them. To do this, we'll divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold:
110 / 45 ≈ 2.44

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Elly needs 3 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to find out how many questions she needs to get right in total. 

First, let's find out how many questions she got right on the first test. 
60% of 70 questions is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions right, we need to find the total number of questions. Let's assume the total number of questions is x. 
70% of x is 0.7x. We know that 0.7x = 42 + y, where y is the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test.

We also know that the total number of questions is the sum of the questions on both tests, which is 70 + 40 = 110 questions. 
So, x = 110.

Now we can substitute x into the equation 0.7x = 42 + y and solve for y.
0.7 * 110 = 42 + y
77 = 42 + y
y = 77 - 42
y = 35

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

For the rooms, half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Since there are 8 rooms in total, half of them is 8 / 2 = 4 rooms with small candles and 4 rooms with medium candles.

The total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.
The total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a day and then multiply it by the number of days in June.

Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, Derrick makes 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

The price of each doughnut is $2. So, the total amount of money Derrick makes in a day is 120 * $2 = $240.

June has 30 days. Therefore, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June is $240 * 30 = $7200.

The final answer is: $7200"

"To find the new speaking speed, we need to multiply John's original speed by 2.5. 

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. 

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words per page = 4500 words

To find the time it takes to speak 4500 words, we can divide the total number of words by the new speaking speed.

Time = Total words / New speed = 4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 hours

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the information given:

Day 1: 50 people
Day 2: 20 more people than Day 1, so 50 + 20 = 70 people
Day 3: Twice the number of people as Day 2, so 2 * 70 = 140 people

The total number of people seen on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week (4 days), the total number of people seen on those days is 60 * 4 = 240 people.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 (first three days) + 240 (rest of the week) = 500 people.

The final answer is: 500"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. So, after the first 60 seconds, a total of 20 + 60 = 80 kernels have popped.
4. In the next 30 seconds, the kernels pop at four times the initial rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.
5. So, after 90 seconds, a total of 80 + 80 = 160 kernels have popped.
6. In the final 30 seconds, the kernels pop at half the rate of the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.
7. So, after 120 seconds, a total of 160 + 40 = 200 kernels have popped.
8. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.
9. So, the total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210.

The final answer is: 210"
"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade he needs to make, including the extra gallon for Allen. 

Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party, and an extra gallon for Allen, so the total amount of lemonade is 4 + 1 = 5 gallons.

Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, and 5 gallons require 5 cups of lemon juice, we need to find out how many lemons are needed to get 5 cups of juice.

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can set up a proportion to find out how many lemons are needed for 5 cups of juice:

6 lemons / 1 cup = x lemons / 5 cups

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

6 * 5 = x * 1
30 = x

So, Tim needs 30 lemons in total.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption and then multiply it by 7.

"To find the distance Elvis traveled west, we multiply the speed by the time: 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles. 

To find the distance Elvis traveled east, we multiply the speed by the time: 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the difference between the two distances to determine how far he is from his house now. 

The distance traveled west is 90 miles, and the distance traveled east is 144 miles. The difference is 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

Initial value of the boat: $9000

First year depreciation: 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after first year: $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Second year depreciation: 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after second year: $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Third year depreciation: 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882

"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to find the number of orange and yellow candies. 

The bag has 54 red candies. Since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, the number of orange candies is 54 * 2 = 108.

The number of yellow candies is half as many as red candies, so the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we know the total number of candies is 232. We can find the total number of non-pink candies by adding the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of non-pink candies from the total number of candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

Mazie has 52 marbles and gives them to twins Dallas and Darla. 

Dallas has a total of 21 marbles after dropping 4 of them. This means Dallas initially had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles.

Since Mazie gave the marbles to both Dallas and Darla, the total number of marbles given is equal to the initial number of marbles Mazie had, which is 52.

We know that Dallas had 25 marbles. To find out how many marbles Darla has, we need to subtract the number of marbles Dallas had from the total number of marbles given by Mazie.

So, the number of marbles given to Darla is 52 - 25 = 27.

Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, we can divide them into two equal halves: 6 toy soldiers for the first half and 6 toy soldiers for the second half.

For the first half, Matthew would get $5 per toy, so the total amount for the first half would be 6 * $5 = $30.

For the second half, Matthew would get $7 per toy, so the total amount for the second half would be 6 * $7 = $42.

To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we add the amounts for the first and second halves together: $30 + $42 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days. So, the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Now, Nate starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. This means that the net number of holes filled in per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes.

To find out how many days it takes to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled in per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the number of weeks by dividing the total number of days by 7: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the average enrollment at Butler High School, we need to multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4.

Average enrollment at Norman High School: 4000 students
Average enrollment at Butler High School: 4000 * (3/4) = 3000 students

Now, we need to find the difference in enrollment between the two schools.

Difference in enrollment: 4000 - 3000 = 1000

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The final answer is: 2325"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
- Igor gathered two more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested: 14 + 2 = 16 test tubes, but we already know he gathered 8 test tubes, so this statement is incorrect. Let's assume he gathered 2 more than the number of Petri dishes requested, which is 14 + 2 = 16 test tubes, but this is not the case. Let's assume he gathered 2 less than the number of Petri dishes requested, which is 14 - 2 = 12 test tubes.
- Igor had the correct number of beakers, which is 7.
- The total number of items Igor had is 29.

Let's assume the correct number of test tubes is 12. Then, the total number of items Igor had is 12 (test tubes) + 7 (beakers) + 14 (Petri dishes) = 33. However, this is not the case, as the total number of items is 29.

Let's assume the correct number of test tubes is 8. Then, the total number of items Igor had is 8 (test tubes) + 7 (beakers) + 14 (Petri dishes) = 29. This matches the given information.

Now, let's find the number of beakers Igor lost. The total number of beakers Igor had is 7, and the total number of beakers he should have had is 7. Therefore, Igor lost 0 beakers.

However, this is not the case, as the problem states that Igor lost several beakers. Let's re-examine the information. If Igor gathered 8 test tubes, then the total number of items Igor had is 8 (test tubes) + 7 (beakers) + 14 (Petri dishes) = 29. This matches the given information.

Let's assume Igor gathered 8 test tubes and lost x beakers. Then, the total number of items Igor had is 8 (test tubes) + (7 - x) (beakers) + 14 (Petri dishes) = 29.

"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to first determine the number of eggs in the second basket. Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as in the first, we multiply the number of eggs in the first basket by 2.

Number of eggs in the first basket: 10
Number of eggs in the second basket: 10 * 2 = 20

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets to find the total.

Total number of eggs: 10 + 20 = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Alexandra raises $430.
- Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
- Sarah raises $300.
- Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up the total amount raised by all the girls:
$430 (Alexandra) + $750 (Kim) + $300 (Sarah) + $700 (Maryam) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa.
2. Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron.
3. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
4. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if Aaron runs 1 mile in x minutes, Vanessa would run 1 mile in 2x minutes. 

Given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes and he ran half the distance Vanessa did (since Vanessa ran twice as far), we can set up the equation:

x * 2 = 16 (since Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa did, but at twice the speed, it takes him the same amount of time to run half the distance Vanessa did)

Solving for x, we get:
x = 16 / 2
x = 8

Now that we know Aaron runs 1 mile in 8 minutes, we can find out how long it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile:
Vanessa runs 1 mile in 2x = 2 * 8 = 16 minutes

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, we multiply the time it takes her to run 1 mile by 4:
16 * 4 = 64 minutes

The final answer is: 64"
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line

Since he already has 6 feet of new line, we need to subtract that from the total amount of line required.

600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate their daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

Daily revenue = (2 meals * $5 per meal) + $5 bottle of wine
Daily revenue = (2 * $5) + $5
Daily revenue = $10 + $5
Daily revenue = $15

Since they are open 2 days a week, we multiply the daily revenue by 2:
Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * 2
Weekly revenue = $15 * 2
Weekly revenue = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"To find the cost of each watermelon, we first need to find the total selling price of all the watermelons. 

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price of each watermelon is $80 / 50 = $1.60.

He sold them at a profit of 25%, which means the selling price is 125% of the cost price (100% of the cost price + 25% profit). 

The selling price of each watermelon is 1.25 * $1.60 = $2.

The total selling price of all the watermelons is 50 * $2 = $100.

The profit made is $100 - $80 = $20.

The selling price of each watermelon is $2.

2. Since James is twice as old as Dora, James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old now.
3. James is the son of John, and John had James when he was 19. This means John is 19 + 18 = 37 years old now.
4. John's youngest son was born when John was 32. This means the youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old now.
5. In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

Ana peels 1 orange in 3 minutes, so in 1 hour (60 minutes), she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels 1 orange in 4 minutes, so in 1 hour (60 minutes), she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

To find out how many more oranges Ana has peeled than Jane, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peeled from the number of oranges Ana peeled: 20 - 15 = 5.

"To find out how much Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor cost.

The original price of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, so he pays 20% of the original price. 
20% of $400 is 0.2 x $400 = $80.

The labor cost is $50 per hour for 3 hours, so the total labor cost is $50 x 3 = $150.

The total cost is the cost of the radiator plus the labor cost, which is $80 + $150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write the equation:

2C + 4W = 70

We can solve the first equation for W:

W = 20 - C

Now, substitute W in the second equation:

2C + 4(20 - C) = 70

Expand the equation:

2C + 80 - 4C = 70

Combine like terms:

-2C + 80 = 70

Subtract 80 from both sides:

-2C = -10

Divide both sides by -2:

C = 5

So, there are 5 chickens on the farm."
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, let's find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. 

Total slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

There are 4 people in total, including Henry and his 3 friends. 

Slices per person = Total slices / Number of people = 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person
