"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

Now, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.

Janet sells these 9 eggs at $2 each, so she makes 9 * 2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can calculate the white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber to get the total number of bolts:

Total bolts = Blue fiber + White fiber
Total bolts = 2 bolts + 1 bolt
Total bolts = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we need to first find the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

Let's denote the increased value as x. We can set up the equation: 
80,000 + 50,000 = x + 1.5x (since 150% is the same as multiplying by 1.5)

Combine like terms: 
130,000 = 2.5x

Now, divide both sides by 2.5 to solve for x: 
x = 130,000 / 2.5
x = 52,000

So, the total value of the house after the repairs is $52,000. 

To find the profit, we need to subtract the original cost of the house from the new value: 
Profit = New value - Original cost
Profit = 52,000 - 80,000
Profit = -28,000

However, since Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, we need to add that to the profit to find the total profit: 
Total profit = Profit + Repairs
Total profit = -28,000 + 50,000
Total profit = 22,000

The final answer is: $22,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total number of meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sprint sessions he does in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James does this 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to determine the total number of cups of feed she gives her chickens in a day. 

In the morning, she gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens 25 cups of feed. So, the total number of cups of feed she gives her chickens in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi gives each of her chickens 3 cups of feed per day, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in a day is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, we subtract the total number of cups of feed she gives her chickens in the morning and afternoon from the total number of cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in a day to find out how many cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day. 

60 - 40 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass. 

The sequence of the cost of the glasses is: $5, $3, $1.8, $1.08, $0.64, $0.384, $0.2304, $0.13824, $0.082944, $0.0497664, $0.02986584, $0.017949504, $0.0107949032, $0.00646774192, $0.003863860976, $0.002328148578, $0.0014004893488.

To find the total cost, we need to add up the cost of all 16 glasses. 
Total cost = $5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.64 + $0.384 + $0.2304 + $0.13824 + $0.082944 + $0.0497664 + $0.02986584 + $0.017949504 + $0.0107949032 + $0.00646774192 + $0.003863860976 + $0.002328148578 + $0.0014004893488

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   Since Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

2. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   Since Charleston has 80 sheep, Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add up the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
Toulouse has 160 sheep, Charleston has 80 sheep, and Seattle has 20 sheep.
Total sheep = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, let's find the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 x 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Next, we need to add the time it takes to install the updates, which is 20 minutes.

Finally, we need to find the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. 60% of 200 GB is 0.6 x 200 = 120 GB. The time it takes to download 120 GB is 120 / 2 = 60 minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is the sum of the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file: 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the distance traveled in each segment.

1. First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. The distance traveled in this segment is:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

2. Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is traveled in this segment.

3. Next, he drives for 0.5 hours (half an hour) at 30 mph. The distance traveled in this segment is:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

4. Finally, he drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours) at 80 mph. The distance traveled in this segment is:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

Now, we add up the distances traveled in each segment to find the total distance from home:
Total distance = 180 + 0 + 15 + 120 = 315 miles

The final answer is: 315"
"To find Eliza's total earnings, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately, then add them together.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime rate is:
$10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

Her overtime earnings are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Now, we add her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

Her total earnings for this week are $460."
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads from each month together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, we add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of planting the tree and the annual expenses, and then find out when the total earnings from selling lemons will be greater than the total expenses.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual expenses are $3 for watering and feeding the tree. 

The tree will grow 7 lemons per year, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. So, the total earnings per year from selling lemons will be 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

The net earnings per year will be the total earnings from selling lemons minus the annual expenses: $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

To find out when the tree will start earning money, we need to calculate how many years it will take for the total earnings to be greater than the initial cost of planting the tree. 

The total earnings after n years will be $7.5 * n. We want to find the smallest n such that $7.5 * n > $90.

Dividing both sides by $7.5, we get n > $90 / $7.5. 

Calculating this, we get n > 12.

Since n must be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a year), the smallest n that satisfies this inequality is 13.

Therefore, it will take 13 years for the tree to start earning money.

The final answer is: 13"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. 
   Let's assume she started with x vacuum cleaners. 
   So, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.

2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. 
   Now, she has x - x/3 = 2/3x vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. 
   Half of 2/3x is (1/2) * (2/3)x = 1/3x. 
   So, she sold 1/3x vacuum cleaners at the orange house.

4. After selling at the orange house, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. 
   So, 2/3x - 1/3x = 5
   Simplifying the equation, we get 1/3x = 5
   Multiplying both sides by 3, we get x = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students enrolled in jazz dance is 4, and the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance is 4. So, the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 16 - 4 - 4 = 8 students.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(8 / 20) * 100 = 40%

"To maximize profit, the merchant should choose the item that will increase in value the most. 

First, calculate the increase in value for each item:

Jewelry: 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125
Electronic gadgets: 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96

Since $125 is greater than $96, the merchant should choose the jewelry. 

The profit will be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. 

On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance.

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:

- Hourly wage: $20
- Hours worked per week: 35
- Weeks worked per year: 50
- Total hours worked per year: 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
- Annual earnings from teaching: 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:

- Hourly wage: $30
- Hours worked per week: 15
- Weeks worked per year: 50
- Total hours worked per year: 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
- Annual earnings from coaching: 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:

Annual salary = Annual earnings from teaching + Annual earnings from coaching
= $35,000/year + $22,500/year
= $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

To find out how many eggs she eats in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of eggs she eats in a week by 4: 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs she will eat in 4 weeks: 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total time Marissa has taken to walk the first 6 miles. She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another hour to walk the next 2 miles, so the total time taken for the first 6 miles is 1 + 1 = 2 hours.

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and she has already walked 6 miles. So, the remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles.

Since Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, and she has already walked 6 miles in 2 hours, her average speed for the entire trail is 12 miles / 3 hours = 4 miles per hour.

Now, let's find the time she needs to take to walk the remaining 6 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour. Time = Distance / Speed = 6 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1.5 hours.

Since she has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles, the time she needs to take to walk the remaining 6 miles is 1.5 hours. 

The speed she needs to walk the remaining distance is Distance / Time = 6 miles / 1.5 hours = 4 miles per hour.

However, the question asks for the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, not the time. Since she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1.5 hours, the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance is 4 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. 

Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the remaining one-third is non-water. So, the amount of non-water in the orange drink is 10 - 6.67 = 3.33 liters.

Now, let's find the amount of water in the pineapple drink. Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

The total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before spilling is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

When 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, the amount of water spilled is 6.67 * (1/10) = 0.667 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 15.67 - 0.667 = 15 liters.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to determine Raymond's current age and then subtract the age at which he had his son.

Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before her, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

Raymond had his son at the age of 23, so we need to find the difference between his current age and the age at which he had his son.

Current age of Raymond - Age at which he had his son = 25 - 23 = 2

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago."
"To find the total number of DVDs sold, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers separately, and then add them together.

The first 3 customers buy one DVD each, so they bought a total of 3 DVDs.
The next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so they bought a total of 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.

Now, let's add the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so we don't need to add anything to the total.

The total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 7."
"To find the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter, we need to calculate the total time it burns and multiply it by the rate at which it melts.

The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

The rate at which the candle melts is 2 centimeters per hour.

So, the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter is 4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since the book was sold with a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of the original price, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so it is x - 0.25x = 0.75x.

We are given that the discounted price is $19.50, so we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find the total cost of the items Marie ordered excluding the pizza, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken meal, the packs of milk, and the apples.

Cost of chicken meal: $12
Cost of 5 packs of milk: 5 * $3 = $15
Cost of 4 apples: 4 * $1.50 = $6
Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes can be found by subtracting the total cost of the other items from the total amount paid.

Cost of pizza boxes: $50 - $33 = $17

Now, we need to find the number of boxes of pizza. Each box costs $8.50, so we can divide the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of one box to find the number of boxes.

Number of boxes of pizza: $17 / $8.50 = 2

The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 x $22.50 = $67.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 x $42 = $126.

Now, we add the costs of all the items together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

The final answer is: $243"
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 cartons of ice cream for 60 days (1 serving per night for 60 nights).

Each carton has 15 servings, so to find the total number of cartons needed, we divide the total number of servings needed (60) by the number of servings per carton (15):

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the total number of cartons by the cost per carton:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles. 

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance from the first stop to the second stop = Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip - Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip
= 60 - 20
= 40 miles

However, we need to find the distance between the first and second stop, not the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. Since the second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip, we can find the distance from the first stop to the second stop by subtracting 15 miles from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip.

Distance from the first stop to the second stop = Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip - Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip
= 20 + 15
= 35 miles

The distance between the first and second stops is 35 miles.

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's denote the cost of the more expensive pair of heels as x. Since the other pair costs twice as much, the cost of the less expensive pair is 2x. 

We know that the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. So, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = boots - 5.

Combine like terms: 3x = boots - 5.

We also know that one pair of heels costs $33, which is the more expensive pair. So, we can set up the equation: x = 33.

Now we can substitute x = 33 into the equation 3x = boots - 5: 3(33) = boots - 5.

Simplify the equation: 99 = boots - 5.

Add 5 to both sides: 104 = boots.

The final answer is: $104"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x, where x is a constant.

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age:

Allen's age = 11x
= 11(9)
= 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10
= 109

"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide it by the number of people who made the guesses.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first person's guess: 80 / 2 = 40, then 40 + 20 = 60.
The third person guesses 25% more than the first person's guess: 80 * 0.25 = 20, then 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 people who made the guesses. To find the average, we divide the total by the number of people: 240 / 3 = 80.

"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog. 

Number of dogs: 10
Time spent on each dog: 0.5 hours

Total time spent per day = Number of dogs * Time spent on each dog
Total time spent per day = 10 * 0.5
Total time spent per day = 5 hours

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the total time spent per day by 7 to find the total time spent in a week.

Total time spent per week = Total time spent per day * 7
Total time spent per week = 5 * 7
Total time spent per week = 35 hours

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We are given that G = S + 30. We also know that the total number of coins is 110, so S + G = 110.

Substituting G = S + 30 into the second equation, we get S + (S + 30) = 110. Simplifying this equation, we get 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation, we get 2S = 80. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30. G = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25 (which is the decimal form of 25%): 4 * 0.25 = 1. So, he scored 25% more points, which is 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The total points Mike scored is 9."
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first find out how much he spends per day and then multiply it by 30.

Since Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, and they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out the cost of 2 yogurts. 

To find the cost of 2 yogurts, we can divide the total cost of 4 yogurts ($5.00) by 2. 

Cost of 2 yogurts = $5.00 / 2 = $2.50

Now, we can multiply the cost of 2 yogurts by the number of days (30) to find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days.

Total cost = $2.50 * 30 = $75.00

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many Lego sets John sold, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = $195.

Next, we need to find out how much money he spent on video games. He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so the total amount of money he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

Since he had $5 left after buying the video games, we can find out how much money he had before buying the video games by adding the money he had left to the money he spent on video games. So, he had $160 + $5 = $165 before buying the video games.

Now, we can find out how much money he made from selling the Lego sets by subtracting the money he had before buying the video games from the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets. However, we can also find out how much money he made from selling the Lego sets by subtracting the money he spent on video games from the money he had left plus the money he spent on video games. This will give us the same result. 

So, the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets is $165 + $160 = $325.

Now, we can find out how many Lego sets he sold by dividing the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets by the price of each Lego set. So, he sold 325 / 15 = 21.67 Lego sets. However, since we can't sell a fraction of a Lego set, we can round down to 21 Lego sets.

Since John started with 13 Lego sets, we can find out how many Lego sets he still has by subtracting the number of Lego sets he sold from the number of Lego sets he started with. So, he still has 13 - 21 = -8 Lego sets. However, this is not possible since you can't have a negative number of Lego sets. This means that John must have sold more than 13 Lego sets. 

However, we can find out the correct answer by using the fact that he had $5 left after buying the video games. We can find out how much money he had before buying the video games by adding the money he had left to the money he spent on video games. We already found out that he had $165 before buying the video games. 

Now, we can find out how much money he made from selling the Lego sets by subtracting the money he had before buying the video games from the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets. However, we can also find out how much money he made from selling the Lego sets by subtracting the money he spent on video games from the money he had left plus the money he spent on video games. This will give us the same result. 

So, the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets is $165 + $160 = $325. However, we can also find out the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets by subtracting the money he had before buying the video games from the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets. So, the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets is 325 - 165 = $160. 

Now, we can find out how many Lego sets he sold by dividing the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets by the price of each Lego set. So, he sold 160 / 15 = 10.67 Lego sets. However, since we can't sell a fraction of a Lego set, we can round down to 10 Lego sets.

Since John started with 13 Lego sets, we can find out how many Lego sets he still has by subtracting the number of Lego sets he sold from the number of Lego sets he started with. So, he still has 13 - 10 = 3 Lego sets.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his total running time and then divide the total distance by the total time.

John runs 3 hours on the first day. He runs half as much on the other two days, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours on each of those days.

Total running time = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours

Since John runs 3 days a week, we can multiply the total running time by 3 to get the total weekly running time: 6 hours * 3 = 18 hours

Now, we can divide the total distance (60 miles) by the total time (18 hours) to find John's speed:

Speed = Total distance / Total time = 60 miles / 18 hours = 3.33 miles per hour

The final answer is: 3.33"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running and walking speeds. 

Given that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, we can find her running speed by multiplying her skipping speed by 2. 

Running speed = 2 * Skipping speed
Running speed = 2 * 3
Running speed = 6 miles per hour

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4.

Walking speed = Running speed / 4
Walking speed = 6 / 4
Walking speed = 1.5 miles per hour

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, in 6 hours, she will spend 2 hours running and 4 hours walking.

Distance traveled while running = Speed * Time
Distance traveled while running = 6 * 2
Distance traveled while running = 12 miles

Distance traveled while walking = Speed * Time
Distance traveled while walking = 1.5 * 4
Distance traveled while walking = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance traveled while running + Distance traveled while walking
Total distance traveled = 12 + 6
Total distance traveled = 18 miles

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

"To find the distance Polly can stand outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon, we need to calculate the total distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone and then subtract the dragon's reach.

When Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find the distance outside the dragon's reach, we subtract the dragon's reach from the total distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially available.

Total number of pieces initially available = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces

Number of pieces remaining = 14

Number of pieces taken by the guests = Total number of pieces initially available - Number of pieces remaining
= 40 - 14
= 26

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many calories you can still consume, subtract the calories you've already consumed from your daily target. 

2000 (daily target) - 1800 (already consumed) = 200 calories left

Since each serving of the chips has 250 calories, divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find out how many servings you can have.

200 (remaining calories) / 250 (calories per serving) = 0.8 servings

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, multiply the number of servings you can have by the total weight of the bag to find out how many grams you can eat.

0.8 (servings) * 300 (grams per bag) = 240 grams

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Since Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for 10 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks for 20 candles (2 sets of 10 candles). The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles, so the total revenue is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Now, let's calculate the net profit. The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find 2/5 of 5, we multiply 5 by 2/5:
5 * (2/5) = 2
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. To find twice the number of articles, we multiply 7 by 2:
7 * 2 = 14
So, she wrote 14 articles on Wednesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since it takes 4 hours to write one article, we multiply the total number of articles by 4:
26 * 4 = 104

The final answer is: 104"
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to first determine how many Post-it notes she used in total. 

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work. To find the total number of Post-it notes she used, we add 80 and 220: 80 + 220 = 300. 

Since she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, we need to subtract 23 from the total number of Post-it notes she used to find out how many she purchased: 300 - 23 = 277.

The final answer is: 277"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many blue ties John bought. Since he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per tie.

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is twice the number of blue ties.

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

Now, we need to find the cost of each red tie. Since the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we can find the cost of each red tie by adding 50% of the cost of a blue tie to the cost of a blue tie.

Cost of a blue tie = $40
50% of the cost of a blue tie = 0.5 * $40 = $20
Cost of a red tie = Cost of a blue tie + 50% of the cost of a blue tie
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie.

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of a red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on ties by adding the total amount spent on blue ties and the total amount spent on red ties.

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches, since the pieces are 6 inches long. 

1 foot is equal to 12 inches. 

So, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we need to divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches) to find the number of pieces.

Number of pieces = Total length / Length of each piece
= 48 / 6
= 8

"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. 

Number of floors: 15
Number of units per floor: 8

Total number of units = Number of floors * Number of units per floor
Total number of units = 15 * 8
Total number of units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

1/4 of the total number of units = (1/4) * 120
1/4 of the total number of units = 30

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs are produced per week: 
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since eggs are sold in dozens, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens: 
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total amount Lloyd makes per week: 
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

"To find the total time Tom spent traveling, we need to calculate the time he spent traveling from 1 to 4 PM and the time he spent traveling back.

First, let's find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he traveled for 3 hours at 10 miles per hour, the distance is:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find the time he spent traveling back. The distance is the same, 30 miles, and his speed is 6 miles per hour. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

So, the total time Tom spent traveling back is 5 hours."
"To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the total weight of the comic books he removed. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removed 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * (1/4) = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books already removed weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we need to find out how many toys weigh 7.5 pounds. To do this, we can divide 7.5 by 0.5 (since 1/2 is the same as 0.5). 

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"To find the revenue earned on Thursday, we need to calculate the total revenue from truck tires and car tires separately and then add them together. 

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday: 6 truck tires * $60 per tire = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday: 4 car tires * $40 per tire = $160
Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Revenue from car tires on Friday: 12 car tires * $40 per tire = $480

Since the revenue from car tires on Friday ($480) is higher than the revenue from both truck and car tires on Thursday ($520), we need to compare the revenue from car tires on Friday with the total revenue on Thursday.

To find the difference in revenue, we subtract the revenue from car tires on Friday from the total revenue on Thursday: $520 - $480 = $40

"To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 30 years and then add 5% of that value.

Marcy works for 30 years, but she only gets the full pension for 10 years (30 - 20 = 10). For the first 10 years, she gets the full $50,000/year. 

For the next 20 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension per year. To find the value of the pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the total amount she would have received in the first 10 years and then add the present value of the annuity for the next 20 years.

The total amount she would have received in the first 10 years is $50,000/year * 10 years = $500,000.

The present value of the annuity for the next 20 years is 5% of the value of the pension per year. To find the present value of the annuity, we can use the formula for the present value of an annuity:

PV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^(-n)) / r]

where PV is the present value, PMT is the annual payment, r is the interest rate, and n is the number of years.

However, we don't know the interest rate. Since we are not given any information about the interest rate, we will assume it is 0% for simplicity. This is a simplification, as in real-world scenarios, the interest rate would be a key factor in calculating the present value of an annuity.

PV = $50,000 * [(1 - (1 + 0)^(-20)) / 0.05]
PV = $50,000 * [(1 - 1) / 0.05]
PV = $50,000 * 0
PV = $0

However, this is not correct, as it doesn't make sense that the present value of the annuity would be $0. This is because we assumed an interest rate of 0%, which means the present value of the annuity would be the same as the future value. 

A more realistic approach would be to calculate the future value of the annuity and then subtract it from the total amount she would have received in the first 10 years. However, we are not given the interest rate, so we will assume the interest rate is 5% for simplicity.

The future value of the annuity is:
FV = PMT * [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r

FV = $50,000 * [(1 + 0.05)^20 - 1] / 0.05
FV = $50,000 * [7.379 - 1] / 0.05
FV = $50,000 * 6.379 / 0.05
FV = $50,000 * 127.98
FV = $6,399,000

However, this is the future value of the annuity, and we want to find the present value. We can use the formula for the present value of a future sum:

PV = FV / (1 + r)^n
PV = $6,399,000 / (1 + 0.05)^20
PV = $6,399,000 / 7.379
PV = $868,000

Now, we can find the total value of the pension after 30 years by adding the total amount she would have received in the first 10 years and the present value of the annuity for the next 20 years:

Total value = $500,000 + $868,000
Total value = $1,368,000

Finally, we can find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years by dividing the total value by 30:

Annual pension = $1,368,000 / 30
Annual pension = $45,600

The final answer is: $45,600"
"To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately and then add them together.

The first half of the year is 6 months, and the second half of the year is also 6 months. 

The initial amount charged per month is $140. 

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the company charged her 10% less than the initial amount. To find 10% of $140, we multiply $140 by 0.1, which is $14. Then, we subtract $14 from $140 to get $126. 

So, the amount charged for the second half of the year is $126 per month. For 6 months, Aleena paid 6 * $126 = $756.

To find the total amount she paid, we add the amount paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year: $840 + $756 = $1596.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to determine the car's miles per gallon (mpg) rating. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled since the last fill-up (100 miles) by the amount of gas used (4 gallons).

mpg = distance / gas used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the car's mpg rating, we can calculate the total distance Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity (12 gallons) by the mpg rating.

total distance = tank capacity * mpg
total distance = 12 gallons * 25 miles/gallon
total distance = 300 miles

"To find the total time spent on TV and reading, we need to calculate the time spent in one week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV. 
He then reads for half as long, which is 2 / 2 = 1 hour.

So, in one day, he spends 2 + 1 = 3 hours on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent in one week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

To find the total time spent in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly time by 4: 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

Let's denote the initial amount of money Bailey had as 'x'. 

Bailey received a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total amount she received from her allowance is 5 * 8 = $40.

At the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. 

So, the equation to represent this situation is: x + 40 = 100.

To find the initial amount of money Bailey had, we need to isolate 'x' in the equation. We can do this by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:

x + 40 - 40 = 100 - 40
x = 60

Therefore, Bailey started with $60. 

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much Judy makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week and then multiply it by the number of students per class and the charge per student.

Judy teaches 5 classes per day on weekdays, which is 5 classes * 5 days = 25 classes. 
She also teaches 8 classes on Saturday. 
So, the total number of classes she teaches in a week is 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students per week is 33 classes * 15 students = 495 students.

Judy charges $15 per student, so the total amount she makes in a week is 495 students * $15/student = $7,425.

The final answer is: $7425"
"To find the total number of instructions, we need to add the number of instructions in the first recipe to the number of instructions in the second recipe.

The first recipe has 20 instructions. 
The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so it has 2 * 20 = 40 instructions.

"To find the total amount Shiela will pay each month, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then divide it by the number of months.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 * $150 = $750.

Since a 2% interest will be charged for each unit, the interest for each cell phone is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3.

The total interest for all 5 cell phones is 5 * $3 = $15.

The total amount Shiela will pay for the cell phones is the cost of the cell phones plus the interest, which is $750 + $15 = $765.

Since Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months, we need to divide the total amount by 3 to find the monthly payment.

The monthly payment is $765 / 3 = $255.

The final answer is: $255"

"To find the average square footage of a level, we need to find the total square footage of the sandcastle and then divide it by the number of levels.

The top level has a square footage of 16. Since each level below it has half the square footage, the second level will have 16 / 2 = 8 square footage, the third level will have 8 / 2 = 4 square footage, and the fourth level will have 4 / 2 = 2 square footage.

The total square footage of the sandcastle is 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

There are 4 levels in the sandcastle. 

The average square footage of a level is 30 / 4 = 7.5.

"To find the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year and then divide it by the number of cups in a bag.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days. So, the total number of cups of dog food eaten in the first 180 days is 1 * 180 = 180 cups.

The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the total number of cups of dog food eaten in the remaining days is 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

The total number of cups of dog food eaten in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year is 550 / 110 = 5.

"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package option.

For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers for $1, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better option.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages. The total cost is 9 packages * $1 per package = $9.

To find the cost of buying 18 flowers at the more expensive option, we calculate 18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages. The total cost is 6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.

The amount of money saved is $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"

1/6 of 24 liters = (1/6) * 24 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, they each got 4 liters of water. So, together they got 2 * 4 = 8 liters.

Now, we subtract the water the girls got and the water the boy got from the total amount of water.

Total water initially = 24 liters
Water the girls got = 8 liters
Water the boy got = 6 liters

Water left = Total water initially - (Water the girls got + Water the boy got)
= 24 - (8 + 6)
= 24 - 14
= 10 liters

The total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's denote the number of games the team lost as L and the number of games they won as W. We are given that W = L + 8. We also know that the total number of games played is 22, so W + L = 22.

We can substitute W from the first equation into the second equation: (L + 8) + L = 22. This simplifies to 2L + 8 = 22.

Now, we can solve for L by subtracting 8 from both sides: 2L = 22 - 8, which gives 2L = 14. 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get L = 7. 

Now that we know L, we can find W by substituting L into the first equation: W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after the 5th year and then calculate the increase for the next three years.

Initial salary: $600
Increase after 5 years: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 5 years: $600 + $60 = $660

Now, we need to calculate the increase for the next three years. Since the increase is 10% of the current salary, we will apply this increase for three consecutive years.

Salary after 6 years: 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 6 years: $660 + $66 = $726
Salary after 7 years: 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 7 years: $726 + $72.60 = $798.60
Salary after 8 years: 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 8 years: $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46
Salary after 9 years: 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.85

"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

Number of invited guests = 16
Number of guests who don't show up = 1/4 * 16 = 4
Number of guests who will attend = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we can multiply the number of guests who will attend by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

Number of gift bags needed = 12 * 0.75 = 9

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag.

Cost per gift bag = $2
Total cost = 9 * $2 = $18

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
2. There are two cats for every dog.
3. The number of dogs is 60.

Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, the number of cats can be calculated as follows:
Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know the number of dogs (60) and the number of cats (120). The combined number of dogs and cats is:
Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

According to the first point, the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats:
Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats:
Total number of pets = Number of rabbits + Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 168 + 60 + 120

"Let's break down the information given:

- Total cars originally on the motorway = 30
- 5 cars took an exit, so the remaining cars that drove through the traffic jam = 30 - 5 = 25
- Total cars that drove through the traffic jam = cars in the first 15 minutes + cars in the remaining 15 minutes
- Cars in the remaining 15 minutes = 20

Let's represent the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. Then, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20.

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, we can set up the equation:

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year. 
2. He baked 15 more cookies than he meant to.
3. He dropped 5 cookies, and now has a total of 110 cookies.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as 'x'. Since he wants to make twice as many this year, he intended to make 2x cookies.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the total number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. This can be represented as (2x + 15) - 5 = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110.

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 2x = 100.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 50.

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

There are 4 teachers, each with 2 lessons per day. So, the total number of lessons per day is 4 * 2 = 8.

The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson. Therefore, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 * 3 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of flowers Ryan has, we need to calculate the total number of flowers he planted and subtract the ones that did not grow.

Ryan plants 2 flowers a day. After 15 days, he would have planted 2 * 15 = 30 flowers.

However, 5 of these flowers did not grow. So, we need to subtract 5 from the total number of flowers planted.

Total flowers = 30 - 5 = 25

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

From point 1, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

From point 2, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Since Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs, we can set up the equation:

300 = 50x, where x is the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 50:

x = 300 / 50
x = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total cost of the lumber, we need to calculate the cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards and the 4 x 4 x 10 boards separately and then add them together.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 per board = $100.

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. 

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 per board.
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 per board.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.
The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 per board = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to first find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 13 = 20. 

We know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120, and this is equal to 20 parts of the ratio. To find the value of one part, we divide 120 by 20, which is 6.

Since the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is 7 parts. To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar, we multiply 7 by 6, which is 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"To find the total amount John paid, we need to calculate the cost of the shoes for all 3 children. 

First, we find the cost of shoes for one child: 2 pairs * $60 per pair = $120.

Then, we multiply the cost for one child by the number of children: $120 * 3 = $360.

So, John paid $360."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Initially, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is:
2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

The next day, the total number of vehicles became 30. To find the number of vehicles added on the second day, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total:
30 (total vehicles) - 10 (initial vehicles) = 20 vehicles added on the second day

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers added on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by 5:
20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. This means that if Adrien's salary is A, then Lylah's salary is A / 1.3 (since 100% + 30% = 130%, or 1.3 times).

2. Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%. This means that his new salary is 1.4 times his old salary. Since Adrien's old salary was $40000, his new salary is 1.4 * 40000 = $56000.

3. Since Adrien's salary increased by 40%, Lylah's salary also increased by 40% (since their salaries increased simultaneously). Let's call Lylah's old salary L. Then her new salary is 1.4L.

4. We know that Adrien's old salary was $40000, which is 1.3 times Lylah's old salary. So we can set up the equation: 40000 = 1.3L.

5. Solving for L, we get L = 40000 / 1.3 = 30769.23 (approximately).

6. Now we know Lylah's old salary, so we can find her new salary: 1.4L = 1.4 * 30769.23 = 43059.12 (approximately).

7. To find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later, we add their new salaries: 56000 + 43059.12 = 99059.12.

The final answer is: $99059"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to first calculate how many sheets he uses in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets of paper. 

2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of sheets Miguel uses in a week by 4 to find out how many sheets he uses in a month.

60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then add them together.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples. 
Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each person brought:
Morisette: 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits
Kael: 10 apples + 4 oranges = 14 fruits

The total number of fruits they have is 13 + 14 = 27."
"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to break down her sleep pattern.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

The rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept for each period:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday and Wednesday: 2 days * 6 hours = 12 hours
- Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday: 4 days * 7 hours = 28 hours

Now, let's add up the total hours: 8 + 12 + 28 = 48

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours:
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Next, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distances from both parts to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:
Total distance = Distance at 10 mph + Distance at 5 mph
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

- Jennie starts with a pile of 60 letters needing stamps.
- She puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps.
- After stamping, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

Since Jennie stamps one-third of the letters, she stamps 60 / 3 = 20 letters.

This means that the number of letters already stamped before Jennie started is 30 - 20 = 10 letters.

So, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons while making the stew.
4. After using the spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as 'x'. 

From point 2, we know that Julia had 'x' spoons initially. 
From point 3, we know that after using 3 spoons, Julia had 'x - 3' spoons left.
From point 4, we know that after her husband gave her 5 more spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. 

So, we can set up the equation: x - 3 + 5 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

Therefore, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages. 

First, we know that Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 
Then, we know that he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. So, the number of fish sausages is 38 + 6 = 44.

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages: 38 + 44 = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we first need to determine the number of friends Amy has. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily has 50 friends, Amy has 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

Now, to find the total number of friends they have together, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have. total_friends = 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120.

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to determine the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity.

First, let's find the cost of a watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we find the cost of an orange. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of the costs of all items: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total amount charged to patients, then subtract the cost of the doctors from the revenue.

First, let's find the total time spent by doctors. Since there are 500 patients and each patient is seen for 24 minutes, the total time spent is:

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:

12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The doctors charge $150 an hour, so the total cost of the doctors is:

200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

The hospital charges $200 an hour to patients, so the total revenue is:

200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

The profit is the total revenue minus the cost of the doctors:

Profit = Total Revenue - Cost of Doctors
= $40,000 - $30,000
= $10,000

The final answer is: $10,000"
"To find the number of elves left, we need to follow the steps:

1. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. Since there are 60 elves initially, a third of them is 60 / 3 = 20. So, 20 elves quit.

2. Now, there are 60 - 20 = 40 elves left.

3. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, we subtract 10 from the remaining elves: 40 - 10 = 30.

Therefore, the number of elves left is 30.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first determine how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked 4 * 6 = 24 miles on Tuesday.

The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. We already know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday, so we can subtract these from the total to find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday: 
41 - 4 - 24 = 13 miles.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

First, let's find out how many questions Mark completed in 8 hours:
8 hours * 5 questions/hour = 40 questions

Since Mark completed 40 questions in 8 hours, he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete in the first test.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.

Now, let's find out how many questions Mark completed in 6 hours:
6 hours * 5 questions/hour = 30 questions

Since Mark completed 30 questions in 6 hours, he left 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete in the second test.

"Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q. 

We are given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B. 

We are also given that there are twice as many babies as queens, so B = 2Q.

We know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700, so W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 2B and B = 2Q into the equation W + B + Q = 700, we get 2B + 2Q + Q = 700.

Combining like terms, we get 2B + 3Q = 700.

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation 2B + 3Q = 700 to get 2(2Q) + 3Q = 700.

Simplifying the equation, we get 4Q + 3Q = 700.

Combining like terms, we get 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute Q = 100 into this equation to get B = 2(100) = 200.

Since W = 2B, we can substitute B = 200 into this equation to get W = 2(200) = 400.

The number of worker bees is 400."

Non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
Total cost of non-food items: 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
Tax = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of non-food items:
Total cost of non-food items with tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax:
Total cost = 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

"To calculate the total profit, we first need to determine the total income and total expenses. 

Kim has 3 current clients and 5 potential clients, making a total of 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed per week: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week: $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.
3. The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is 30 (initially left) + 15 (returned) = 45 bees. However, 15 bees returned, so the number of bees that have not returned yet is 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees leave the hive. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave the hive.
5. The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is 30 (initially left) + 60 (left in the next 6 hours) = 90 bees. However, 15 bees returned in the previous 6 hours, and 15 bees returned in the last 6 hours, so the number of bees that have not returned yet is 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees, and 60 - 15 = 45 bees left in the last 6 hours. 
6. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. So, 15 bees return.

"To find out who will win the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet for both Steve and Tim. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, we can convert their distances as follows:

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school:

Steve's time: distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes to get home and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will win the race. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time:

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To find the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires. 

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and 5 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is 5 * 2 = 10. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * 25 cents = $2.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and 3 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is 3 * 3 = 9. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * 25 cents = $2.25.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and 1 person came by to get their tire inflated. So, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is 1 * 1 = 1.

The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * 25 cents = $0.25.

Now, let's add up the total cost of inflating all the tires: $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

The final answer is: $5.00"
"To find the total cost of the cookies, we need to multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack and then multiply that by the cost per cookie.

Number of packs: 10
Cookies per pack: 6
Cost per cookie: $0.10

Total number of cookies: 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies
Total cost: 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Since Carl pays with a $10 bill, the change he receives is the difference between the $10 bill and the total cost of the cookies.

Change = $10 - $6 = $4

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the total number of french fries in the pack is x.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries, so the remaining amount is x - 14.
2. The seagull ate half of the amount Dave ate, which is 14/2 = 7 french fries. So, the remaining amount is (x - 14) - 7 = x - 21.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 french fries. The remaining amount is (x - 21) - 9 = x - 30.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, which is (2/3)(x - 30). The remaining amount is (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30) = (1/3)(x - 30).
5. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, the remaining amount is (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.
6. Now, we can solve for x: (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5
   (1/3)(x - 30) = 6
   x - 30 = 18
   x = 48

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes per day, each lasting 1 hour. So, the total hours per day for these days is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. Since there are 3 days, the total hours per week for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes per day, each lasting 2 hours. So, the total hours per day for these days is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. Since there are 2 days, the total hours per week for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week is the sum of the hours for the two sets of days, which is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

The final answer is: 272"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches, since the lengths of the rolls and croissants are given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the lengths together: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot): 3360 / 12 = 280 feet

The final answer is: 280"
"To find the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to calculate the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape per month and then multiply it by 2.

Monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.
Gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
Baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, we add up the total number of bananas needed for all the apes for 2 months: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total amount Raphael spent, we need to calculate the cost of the pens, the cost of the notebooks, and the cost of the bond paper, then add them together.

The cost of the pens is 4 * $1.5 = $6.

"To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that hid under the rock from the total number of tadpoles that came out from under the lily pad.

Initially, Finn saw 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 more tadpoles came out from under the lily pad, making it 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles. However, 2 of them hid under a rock, so we need to subtract 2 from 17.

17 - 2 = 15

So, Finn can see 15 tadpoles in the pond now.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the depth of the water on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.
On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = (24 * 2) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we need to add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish he caught. 

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin.
Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
Total fish caught = 19 + 13
Total fish caught = 32

The final answer is: 32"

"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself:

Income lost = Number of hours worked * Hourly wage
Income lost = 3 hours * $35/hour
Income lost = $105

Now, let's compare this to the cost of hiring the accountant:

Cost of hiring the accountant = $90

Since the income lost is greater than the cost of hiring the accountant, Jackie will have more money if she hires the accountant. To find out how much more, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the income lost:

Difference = Income lost - Cost of hiring the accountant
Difference = $105 - $90
Difference = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We are given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation:

S = 2B

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This means that in 2 years, Seth's age will be S + 2 and Brooke's age will be B + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation:

S + 2 + B + 2 = 28

Combine like terms:

S + B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

S + B = 24

Now we can substitute the first equation (S = 2B) into this equation:

2B + B = 24

Combine like terms:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B into the first equation (S = 2B):

S = 2(8)
S = 16

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much they made in total from selling lemonade and then subtract the cost of sugar to find the cost of lemons.

Let's denote the number of gallons as 'g'. Since they get 20 glasses per gallon and each glass is sold for $0.50, the total revenue from selling lemonade is 20 * 0.5 * g = 10g dollars.

The cost of making lemonade is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar per gallon. So, the total cost is 3g + 2g = 5g dollars.

Since they made a profit of $25, we can set up the equation: 10g - 5g = 25.

Simplifying the equation, we get 5g = 25.

Dividing both sides by 5, we get g = 5.

Now that we know they made 5 gallons, we can find the cost of lemons by multiplying the cost per gallon by the number of gallons: 3 * 5 = 15.

Winner's votes = 3/4 * 80
Winner's votes = 0.75 * 80
Winner's votes = 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got is the difference between the total number of votes and the winner's votes.

Loser's votes = Total votes - Winner's votes
Loser's votes = 80 - 60
Loser's votes = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. According to the problem, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is 4x.

It's also given that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, so the number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

We are not given any information about the total number of flowers ordered, but we do know that Sandra is unhappy with the incomplete order delivery. Since we are trying to find the number of red roses that Fred must deliver, we can assume that the missing red roses are the ones that were not delivered.

Since we don't have any information about the total number of flowers, we can use the information about the pink calla lilies to find the value of 'x'. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is 5x and it is equal to 200. 

So, we can set up the equation 5x = 200 and solve for 'x'.

5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the value of 'x', we can find the number of red roses. The number of red roses is 4x, so the number of red roses is 4 * 40 = 160.

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 2, we can write an equation to represent the situation two years ago:

Mark's age two years ago = (1/2) * Jan's age two years ago + 5

Since Jan is 30 now, two years ago Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Mark's age two years ago = (1/2) * 28 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 14 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 19

Now, we know Mark's age two years ago was 19. To find Mark's current age, we add 2 to this:

Mark's current age = 19 + 2
Mark's current age = 21

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's age:

Jean's age = Mark's age + 2
Jean's age = 21 + 2
Jean's age = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the total time for the well-rounded team and the less well-rounded team.

The well-rounded team's total time is the sum of each member's time, which is 55 seconds for each member. Since there are 4 members, the total time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

To find the difference in time between the two teams, we subtract the less well-rounded team's time from the well-rounded team's time: 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then find the difference between these two probabilities.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is the number of favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (6). 

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = (3/6) = 0.5 or 50%.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the product of the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll. 

Probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die = (3/6) = 0.5

Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.25 or 25%

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities and express it as a percentage.

Difference in probability = 50% - 25% = 25%

So, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find out how many apples Jenna picked, we need to determine half of the number of apples her mom picked. Since her mom picked 20 apples, half of that would be 20 / 2 = 10 apples. 

Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, Jenna picked 10 apples. 

To find the total number of apples they both picked, we need to add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mom picked. 

20 (mom's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30 apples.

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of straw pieces distributed among the hamsters and rabbits. 

There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of straw pieces distributed among the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

There is a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

The total number of straw pieces distributed among the hamsters and rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 70 pieces are distributed among the hamsters and rabbits, the remaining straw pieces are distributed among the rats. So, the number of straw pieces distributed among the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's assume the number of rats in each cage is 'r'. Then, the total number of rats is 3r.

The total number of straw pieces distributed among the rats is 90, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. So, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15.

Since there are 3 cages of rats, the number of rats in each cage is 15 / 3 = 5.

"To find the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The initial amount owed is $100.
The monthly interest rate is 2% or 0.02.

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

The total interest is $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

The total amount Mandy should pay is the initial amount plus the total interest: $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

Rounded to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to first calculate the total cost and total revenue.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is the sum of the cost of buying and transporting the bags: $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $30x - $22x = $8x.

We are given that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation: $8x = $400.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8: x = $400 / $8 = 50.

"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total minutes he collects peaches and then multiply it by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes per hour to get the total minutes:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the total minutes by the number of peaches per minute:

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

"To find the total number of trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees over 10 years, considering the trees he plants, chops down, and the ones that die.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees.

Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, resulting in a net gain of 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Over 10 years, the net gain would be 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

So, the total number of trees after 10 years would be 50 (initial trees) + 80 (net gain) = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we calculate 30% of 130, which is 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees.

The number of trees left after 30% die would be 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find the number of pink and white flamingos, we need to break down the events step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard. So, the number of white flamingos is 6.

The number of pink flamingos left after taking 6 away is 18 - 6 = 12.

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is now 12 + 18 = 30.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots used = Number of restaurants * Pounds per restaurant
Total pounds of carrots used = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots used = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total pounds of carrots used from the total pounds of carrots available to find out how many pounds will not be used.

Pounds not used = Total pounds available - Total pounds used
Pounds not used = 200 - 80
Pounds not used = 120

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Mark edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers.
2. Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays.
3. Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week.
4. Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.

Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, let's denote the number of sentences edited for each publisher as x. Since he edits a total of 1000 sentences, we can set up the equation:

x + x = 1000
Combine like terms:
2x = 1000
Divide both sides by 2:
x = 500

So, Mark edits 500 sentences for each publisher.

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, and Mark edits 500 sentences for Publisher A, the total amount he earns from Publisher A is:

500 * 5 = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, the rate per sentence for Publisher B is:
2 * 5 = 10 cents

Mark edits 500 sentences for Publisher B, so the total amount he earns from Publisher B is:
500 * 10 = 5000 cents

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, add the earnings from both publishers:
2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents

"To find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs to earn and subtract the amount she already has.

The total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is $30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn. 

Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn as 'x'. Then, the total amount she earns from babysitting is 4 * $5 = $20. The total amount she earns from mowing the lawn is $4x.

The total amount she needs to earn is $70 - $10 (initial savings) = $60.

The equation to represent the situation is: $20 (babysitting) + $4x (mowing) = $60.

"To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(l + w)
P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of water loss for both pools is 8 gallons/minute (4 gallons/minute each).

In 4 minutes, the total amount of water lost from both pools is 8 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 32 gallons.

The big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y' gallons. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y gallons.

Since the initial amount of water in the big pool was 2x gallons and the small pool was x gallons, and 32 gallons were lost in total, we can set up the following equation:

2x - 32 + y = 4y

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 32 = 3y

Since the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, we can also set up the following equation:

4y = y + (x - 32)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3y = x - 32

Now we have two equations:

2x - 32 = 3y
3y = x - 32

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

2x - 32 = 3(x - 32)/3

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 32 = x - 32/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

6x - 96 = 3x - 32

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:

3x - 96 = -32

Adding 96 to both sides, we get:

3x = 64

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 64/3

Now that we know the initial amount of water in the small pool (x), we can find the current amount of water in the small pool (y). We can use the equation 3y = x - 32:

3y = 64/3 - 32

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

9y = 64 - 96

Simplifying the equation, we get:

9y = -32

Dividing both sides by 9, we get:

y = -32/9

However, since the amount of water in the pool cannot be negative, this solution is incorrect. Let's re-examine the problem.

We can use the equation 3y = x - 32 to find the relationship between x and y. Since x = 64/3, we can substitute this value into the equation:

3y = 64/3 - 32

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

9y = 64 - 96

Simplifying the equation, we get:

9y = -32

However, this solution is still incorrect. Let's re-examine the problem.

We can use the equation 2x - 32 = 3y to find the relationship between x and y. Since x = 64/3, we can substitute this value into the equation:

2(64/3) - 32 = 3y

Simplifying the equation, we get:

128/3 - 32 = 3y

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

128 - 96 = 9y

Simplifying the equation, we get:

32 = 9y

Dividing both sides by 9, we get:

y = 32/9

However, this solution is still incorrect. Let's re-examine the problem.

We can use the equation 2x - 32 = 3y to find the relationship between x and y. Since the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, we can set up the following equation:

4y = y + (x - 32)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3y = x - 32

We can also use the equation 2x - 32 = 3y to find the relationship between x and y. Since the initial amount of water in the big pool was 2x gallons and the small pool was x gallons, and 32 gallons were lost in total, we can set up the following equation:

2x - 32 + y = 4y

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 32 = 3y

We can equate the two expressions for 3y:

x - 32 = 3y

x - 32 = (2x - 32)/3 * 3

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 32 = 2x - 32

Subtracting x from both sides, we get:

-32 = -x

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

32 = x

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn, which is the sum of the cost of the shoes and the belt. 

Total cost = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Since Lori earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours to work = 44 hours

"To find the total amount Janeth will pay, we need to calculate the total interest she will pay over 12 months. 

First, let's find the interest she will pay each month. 10% of $2000 is 0.1 * 2000 = $200. 

Since she will pay $165 a month, the interest she will pay each month is $200 - $165 = $35.

Now, let's find the total interest she will pay over 12 months. $35 * 12 = $420.

The total amount she will pay is the initial amount plus the interest. $2000 + $420 = $2420.

Since she will pay $165 a month for 12 months, the total amount she will pay is $165 * 12 = $1980.

The remaining balance will be the total amount she will pay minus the initial amount. $2420 - $1980 = $440.

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to determine the number of dahlias and add it to the number of roses. 

We know there are 4 roses in the vase. We also know there are 7 more dahlias than roses. 

Let's calculate the number of dahlias: 
Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, let's add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers in the vase:
Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to find their current ages and then add 3 to each age. 

Given that Harriet is 21 years old now, and Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). 

In three years, their ages will be: 
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3:

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored. 

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Naomi scored 68 points. Half of 68 is 34. 10 more than 34 is 44. So, Yuri scored 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. Naomi scored 68 points. 17 more than 68 is 85. So, Brianna scored 85 points.

The total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points. 

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points scored by all four students.

Since Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left, we multiply the amount of water left by 2.

Rainwater collected = 2 * 30 = 60 liters

Now, we add the water left in the tank and the rainwater collected to find the total amount of water in the tank.

Total water in the tank = Water left in the tank + Rainwater collected

After losing 8 water type cards:
Water type cards = 40 - 8 = 32
Total cards = 30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 32 (water) = 82

After buying 14 grass type cards:
Total cards = 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

Now, we can calculate the percentage chance of picking a water type card:
Percentage chance = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards) * 100

6 tomatoes/day / 2 = 3 tomatoes/day (girlfriend's consumption)

Now, we multiply the girlfriend's consumption by 7 days in a week.

3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week (girlfriend's consumption)

Total tomatoes consumed per week = Steve's consumption + girlfriend's consumption
= 42 tomatoes/week + 21 tomatoes/week
= 63 tomatoes/week

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines Steve needs, we divide the total tomatoes consumed per week by the tomatoes produced per vine.

63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how many pizzas John needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of slices required and then divide it by the number of slices per pizza.

Total number of friends: 20
Number of slices per friend: 4
Total number of slices required: 20 * 4 = 80

Number of slices per pizza: 8
Number of pizzas required: 80 / 8 = 10

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many new pens Ram can make from the ink of the 25 pens he buys.

"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to determine the ages of Mary and Joan first.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is five years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age by adding 5 to Jessa's age: 
Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5
Joan's age = 20 + 5
Joan's age = 25

Now, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan. To find Mary's age, we subtract 2 from Joan's age:
Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Mary's age = 25 - 2
Mary's age = 23

Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages:
Sum of ages = Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age
Sum of ages = 20 + 25 + 23
Sum of ages = 68

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then convert that to hours.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike receives from his remaining 3 pen pals. Since each of them sends 2 letters a week, and there are 3 of them, the total number of letters he receives is 2 * 3 = 6 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries.

Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin. So, Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin some fries, and then Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, Colby took 2 fries from Griffin.

After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin was left with 9 - 2 = 7 fries.

Since Griffin ended up with 27 fries, Ginger must have given him 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as x. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2 again:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for each day, then multiply it by the number of days, and finally multiply it by the number of weeks. 

The makeup artist charges $250 an hour and works 6 hours a day. So, the cost for each day is $250 * 6 = $1500.

Since she needs it done 4 times a week, the cost for each week is $1500 * 4 = $6000.

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total cost before the discount is $6000 * 5 = $30,000.

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.10: $30,000 * 0.10 = $3000.

The final cost after the discount is $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000."

"Let's break down the information given:

- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. 
- Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. 
- Her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.
- Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
- Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies
- Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
- Her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories
- The difference in calories consumed = 9200 - 3600 = 5600

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls, the total number of girls in these two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls in the school is 50% of the total number of students. Let's denote the total number of students as 'T'. Then, 50% of T is 27. We can write this as 0.5T = 27.

To find T, we divide both sides by 0.5: T = 27 / 0.5 = 54.

Now that we know the total number of students in the school is 54, and there are 3 classes, we can find the total number of students in each class by dividing 54 by 3: 54 / 3 = 18.

Since each class has 20 students, we can verify that 3 classes would have 3 * 20 = 60 students, which is not equal to 54. However, we know that the total number of students in the school is 54, and we also know that the first two classes have 15 + 12 = 27 students. Therefore, the third class must have 54 - 27 = 27 students.

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the third class is 50% of 27. We can find this by multiplying 27 by 0.5: 27 * 0.5 = 13.5.

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a student, we can round this number to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can also consider that the total number of students in the school is 54, and the first two classes have 27 students. This means the third class has 27 students, and since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the third class is 50% of 27, which is 13.5. However, since we know that the total number of students in the third class is 27, and the number of girls in the first two classes is 27, the number of girls in the third class must be 0. Since the total number of students in the third class is 27, and the number of girls is 0, the number of boys in the third class is 27.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's represent the number of cougars Rick killed today as 'x'. Then, the number of wolves he killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars he killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars Rick killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12 to find the number of wolves he killed today. Solving for x, we get x = 4.

Now that we know the number of wolves Rick killed today is 3x, we can find the total number of wolves he killed today by substituting x = 4 into 3x, which gives us 3 * 4 = 12.

To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we add the number of wolves and cougars he killed last night to the number of wolves and cougars he killed today. 

Total number of wolves = 10 (last night) + 12 (today) = 22
Total number of cougars = 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27

Total number of animals = 22 (wolves) + 27 (cougars) = 49

The final answer is: 49"
"To find the floor Bill is on, we need to calculate 4 times his starting floor (3) plus 6. 

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 6 = 18

So, Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"To find out how many times Anne went down the water slide, we need to calculate 30% less than Mitchel's 30 times. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, 30% less than 30 is 30 - 9 = 21. 

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Since Anne went 21 times, Robert went 4 * 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

To find out how many cows each stall got, we divide the total number of new cows (40) by the number of stalls (10). 

40 / 10 = 4

So, each stall got 4 new cows. 

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. We know that each stall has 20 original cows and 4 new cows. 

20 (original cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows per stall

Since we want to know the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8.

24 * 8 = 192

The final answer is: 192"
"To find the total amount of money Brady has, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill, and then add them together.

100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1.00
40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2.00
20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2.00
40 dollar bills = 40 x $1.00 = $40.00

Now, let's add the values together:
$1.00 + $2.00 = $3.00
$3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00
$5.00 + $40.00 = $45.00

The total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank is $45.00."
"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections and then multiply it by the weight of each section. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of 8000 from the total weight. To find 30% of 8000, we multiply 8000 by 0.3: 8000 * 0.3 = 2400.

Now, we subtract 2400 from the total weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books and add the flat fee.

The cost of the overdue books is 8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00.

Adding the flat fee of $2.00, the total amount Nancy has to pay is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
2. Andrea has 52 apples, so Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
3. Jamal has half as many bananas as apples, so Jamal has 44 / 2 = 22 bananas.
4. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, but this is not possible since he has fewer bananas than apples. This statement seems to be incorrect or misleading. However, we can proceed with the information we have.
5. Since Jamal has 22 bananas and 44 apples, the total number of fruits Jamal has is 22 + 44 = 66.
6. Andrea has 52 apples, and we don't have any information about her bananas. However, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the fruits Jamal has to the fruits Andrea has. Since we don't know how many bananas Andrea has, we can't find the total number of fruits directly.

However, we can find the number of bananas Andrea has using the information that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, which is incorrect. But we can use the fact that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. Since Jamal has 22 bananas, Andrea has 22 / 2 = 11 bananas.
7. Now we can find the total number of fruits by adding the fruits Andrea has to the fruits Jamal has: 52 (Andrea's apples) + 44 (Jamal's apples) + 11 (Andrea's bananas) + 22 (Jamal's bananas) = 129.

The final answer is: 129"
"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making and then divide that by the number of cups of flour needed per dozen cookies.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Since there are 12 cookies in a dozen, we can divide the total number of cookies by 12 to find out how many dozens of cookies Carla is making: 66 / 12 = 5.5.

Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies, we can multiply the number of dozens of cookies by 2 to find out how many cups of flour Carla needs: 5.5 * 2 = 11.

However, since Carla can't buy a fraction of a cup of flour, we can round up to the nearest whole number to ensure she has enough flour. But in this case, we are looking for the exact amount of flour needed, so we will keep the decimal.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total dollar amount of two-thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to find two-thirds of 9,300. 

Two-thirds of a number is calculated by multiplying the number by 2/3. 

So, we multiply 9,300 by 2/3. 

9,300 * (2/3) = 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62

The final answer is: $62"
"To find the total number of marbles Maddison has now, we need to first calculate the total number of marbles she initially had in the 5 boxes. 

5 boxes * 50 marbles per box = 250 marbles

Then, we add the 20 marbles she received from her friend to the initial total.

250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles

So, Maddison now has 270 marbles."
"To find the number of trees in each yard, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Chris has 6 trees.
2. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has. 
   So, Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.
3. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has.
   First, we find twice the number of trees Ferdinand has: 2 * 3 = 6
   Then, we add 5 to that number: 6 + 5 = 11
   So, Harry has 11 trees.

Now, to find the difference in the number of trees between Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard:
11 (Harry's trees) - 3 (Ferdinand's trees) = 8

"To find the total amount of money the three girls have combined, we need to first determine how much money each girl has. 

Carmen has $100. 
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125. 
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, we add up the amount of money each girl has: $100 + $125 + $175 = $300.

"To find the total price of the house, we need to add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee. 

The selling price is $350,000. 
The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.
The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find out how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract it from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

The total fees paid by Mr. Tan is the sum of the transfer fees and the brokerage fee: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

Now, let's subtract the total fees from the selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

Finally, let's subtract the remaining loan amount from the result: $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

"To find the time it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees, we need to calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 
So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees.

It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil, so the cooking time is 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is the sum of the time it takes to warm up the oil and the time it takes to cook, which is 28 + 23 = 51 minutes.

"To find the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

Each house has 3 bedrooms with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is 3 * 2 = 6. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12.

Each house has 4 additional windows not connected to bedrooms. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is 4 * 2 = 8.

The total number of windows in one house is 12 (bedrooms) + 8 (additional) = 20. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows is 20 * 2 = 40.

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to determine the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches used for the body, which is 900. So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800, and the body takes 900 stitches, the total number of stitches for the sleeves is 1800 - 900 - 270 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, and then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 4/5 * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to first find the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C, and then subtract that from the total number of cards.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A:
2/5 of 80 cards had the letter A: (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B:
1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B. The remaining cards are 80 - 32 = 48. 
So, (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards had the letter B.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C:
5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C. The remaining cards are 48 - 24 = 24. 
So, (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards had the letter C.

Now, we add the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C:
32 + 24 + 15 = 71 cards

Finally, we subtract the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C from the total number of cards to find the number of cards with the letter D:

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let Mico's current age be x and Marco's current age be y. We know that the sum of their ages is 20, so we can write an equation:

x + y = 20

To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to add 10 to both x and y. 

In 10 years, Mico's age will be x + 10 and Marco's age will be y + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + (y + 10).

We can simplify this expression by combining like terms:

(x + 10) + (y + 10) = x + y + 20

Since we know that x + y = 20, we can substitute this into the expression:

x + y + 20 = 20 + 20
= 40

So, the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 40.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: R = 6S
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: (R + 9) = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:
S = 6

Number of cobras: 40
Number of spots per cobra: 70
Total spots on cobras: 40 * 70 = 2800

Since the cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, the number of spots per mamba is half the number of spots per cobra.

Number of spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35

To find the total number of spots on the mambas, we multiply the number of mambas by the number of spots per mamba.

Number of mambas: 60
Number of spots per mamba: 35
Total spots on mambas: 60 * 35 = 2100

Now, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas to find the combined total.

Total spots on cobras: 2800
Total spots on mambas: 2100
Combined total spots: 2800 + 2100 = 4900

To find half the number of spots, we divide the combined total by 2.

Combined total spots: 4900
Half the combined total: 4900 / 2 = 2450

Given that the car in the fast lane traveled 480 miles at 60 miles/hour, we can calculate its time as follows:
Time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours.

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, its speed is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
4. Together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, which means they have 1/10 of the total medals given out.

Let's represent the total medals given out as 'x'. Then, 1/10 of x is equal to 39. We can write this as an equation:

1/10 * x = 39

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 10:

x = 39 * 10
x = 390

"To find out how many chocolate bars are available in total, we multiply the number of packets by the number of chocolate bars in each packet: 8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars.

Since each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars.

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children: 40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars.

Since there are 8 children, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children to find out how many each child will get: 16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars/child.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find out how many hours she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert her working hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works in 150 minutes:

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed, we need to first calculate their points after the fourth round.

Initially, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's calculate the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed:
Mike has 22 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83."
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to determine how many oranges the sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, so the youngest son is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. In total, they wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges, and 12 were washed. To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges: 15 - 12 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total count of activities, we need to calculate the number of activities for each day and then add them together.

Day 1: 
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Day 2: 
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Total activities for Day 1: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170
Total activities for Day 2: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

Total count of activities in two days: 170 + 200 = 370

The final answer is: 370"
"To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then divide the total amount of rice available by that amount.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we can divide the total amount of rice available (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he sold bread for 5 days. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. 

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates

Since he was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 working days. His target for the week was 120 crates, but he had 2 less working days. 

To find the target for 5 working days, we need to calculate the target for 7 days and then multiply it by 5/7.

Target for 7 days = 120 crates
Target for 5 days = (120 * 5) / 7 = 85.71 (approximately)

However, since we can't sell a fraction of a crate, we will round down to 85 crates for 5 working days.

Now, we can find out how many crates Sam was off from his target by subtracting the total crates sold from the target for 5 working days.

Crates off from target = Target for 5 days - Total crates sold
= 85 - 65
= 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to determine the number of bids made by Carmen and the total amount she paid. 

Since there are 3 other people who bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them, she makes 3 bids. The initial bid is $200, and each subsequent bid increases by $50. 

The bids made by Carmen are as follows:
- 1st bid: $200
- 2nd bid: $250
- 3rd bid: $300

The total amount Carmen paid is the sum of these bids: $200 + $250 + $300 = $750.

The final numerical answer is: $750"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total miles driven, the total cost of driving, and the total bonus paid.

1. Total miles driven: Since John goes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 = 60 miles. He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven per year is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

2. Total cost of driving: John is charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of driving per year is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

3. Total bonus paid: John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

4. Total cost: The total cost is the sum of the total cost of driving and the total bonus paid, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final answer is: $31,800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of pages and how they are arranged in the tabloid. 

In a standard tabloid, the pages are arranged in a way that the first page is on the left back, the second page is on the left front, the 32nd page is on the right back, and the 31st page is on the right front. 

Since the pages are folded, we can think of it as a single sheet of paper being folded in half, with the first page on the left back and the 32nd page on the right back. 

When we unfold the paper, we get two pages on the left side (page 1 and page 2) and two pages on the right side (page 31 and page 32). 

Continuing this pattern, we can see that we need 16 pieces of paper to make a 32-page tabloid, as each piece of paper will have 2 pages on it. 

However, this is not the case, as the question asks for the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid. 

To make a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider that each piece of paper will have 2 pages on it, but we also need to account for the fact that the first and last pages are on the outside of the fold. 

So, we can think of it as having 16 pieces of paper, but with the first and last pages being on the outside of the fold, which means we need an additional piece of paper for the first and last pages. 

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is 16 + 1 = 17."
"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to first calculate how much she spent on food and snacks. Since she spent half of her $50 on food and snacks, we can calculate this as:

$50 / 2 = $25

She also spent an additional $10 on rides. So, the total amount she spent is:

$25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35

Now, to find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she brought:

$50 (initial amount) - $35 (total spent) = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Total books = 250
2. Unsold books = 50
3. Books sold this year = 45
4. Books sold in the first year = 2 * Books sold this year = 2 * 45 = 90
5. Books sold in the second year = Total books - (Unsold books + Books sold this year + Books sold in the first year) 
   = 250 - (50 + 45 + 90)
   = 250 - 185
   = 65

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
Total money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book
= 65 * 20
= 1300

The final answer is: $1300"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Since Watson gets a $300 bonus each week, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the month of April, which has 4 weeks:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April."
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to calculate 20% of 20, since he beat 80% of the people he arm wrestled.

20% of 20 is calculated as 0.20 * 20 = 4.

So, John lost to 4 people."
"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we first need to determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The total number of loaves produced is 60, and 40 are sold in the morning. So, the number of loaves left is 60 - 40 = 20.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. 

Half of 20 is calculated as (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves sold in the afternoon.

The final numerical answer is: 10"
"To find out how much weight Sandy needs to lose, we first need to determine how much weight Joey loses in a week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks to find the weekly weight loss.

Weight lost by Joey in a week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we can multiply the weekly weight loss of Joey by 4 to find the total weight Sandy needs to lose.

Weight lost by Sandy = 2 pounds/week * 4 weeks = 8 pounds

Now, we know that Sandy needs to lose 8 pounds. Since Sandy loses the same amount of weight as Joey in a week, it will take Sandy the same amount of time to lose 8 pounds as it takes Joey to lose 2 pounds.

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of a tub of ice cream is $13, and it is now sold at $11. The discount on each tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2.

If you buy 2 tubs of ice cream, the total discount will be 2 * $2 = $4.

The original price of a packet of milk is not given, but it is sold at a discount of $0.5. Let's assume the original price of a packet of milk is x. The selling price of a packet of milk will be x - $0.5.

If you buy 4 packets of milk, the total discount will be 4 * ($x - $0.5). However, we don't know the value of x. We can express the total discount on the packets of milk as 4x - $2.

The total savings will be the sum of the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk: $4 + (4x - $2).

However, we are not given the value of x. To find the total savings, we need more information about the original price of a packet of milk."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs grown after 15 days.

The person will grow an extra arm every 3 days. To find out how many arms they will grow in 15 days, we divide 15 by 3. 

15 / 3 = 5

So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

The person will grow an extra leg every 5 days. To find out how many legs they will grow in 15 days, we divide 15 by 5.

15 / 5 = 3

So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

In total, the person will grow 5 extra arms and 3 extra legs, which is a total of 8 new limbs.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we need to calculate how much he has spent so far and subtract that from the total amount he has.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits:
6 suits * $100 = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
Cost of a business suit = $100
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent so far:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so he has a total of $6000 - $2000 = $4000 to spend on the trip.

Now, let's subtract the amount spent so far from the total amount available for spending:
$4000 - $1950 = $2050

Therefore, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

The final answer is: $2050"
"To find the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to first find the total number of eggs consumed in a day and then multiply it by 7.

There are 5 people in the family. Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs consumed by these 3 people is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs. The rest of the people (5 - 3 = 2) eat 2 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs consumed by these 2 people is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

1. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
2. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
3. The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60000.
4. The population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, so the current population is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

The final answer is: 120000"
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

The total number of players on the team is 105, which is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. 

So, we can write the equation: D + 2D + D/2 = 105.

To solve for D, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2D + 4D + D = 210.

Combine like terms: 7D = 210.

Divide both sides by 7: D = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

For the 2 families with 6 people: 2 * 6 = 12 people
For the 3 families with 4 people: 3 * 4 = 12 people
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24 people

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, we subtract those from the total: 24 - 8 = 16 people

Then, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 2 people. So, we subtract those from the number of people who couldn't come due to illness: 8 - 2 = 6 people

Now, we subtract the people who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments from the total number of people invited: 24 - 6 = 18 people

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 (initial marbles) + 20 (bought from Johanna) + 8 (given by his father) = 98 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 98 * 2 = 196 kgs.

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Cost = Volume * cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * 0.1

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls, nongendered children, and then add them to the number of boys.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:
Number of girls = 3 * Number of boys
Number of girls = 3 * 30
Number of girls = 90

Given that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, we can calculate the number of nongendered children as follows:
Number of nongendered children = (1/10) * Number of boys
Number of nongendered children = (1/10) * 30
Number of nongendered children = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children
Total number of children = 30 + 90 + 3
Total number of children = 123

"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Let's assume the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x (since the ratio is 1:3).

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women at the party. The total number of people at the party is 25 + 15 = 40.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. To find the number of people who left, we multiply the total number of people by 1/4:

1/4 * 40 = 10

So, 10 people left the party. Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Since 10 people left in total and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

Initially, there were 15 women at the party. After 7 women left, the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

"Let's break down the information given:

Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, totaling 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this:

3x + 2 = 26

where x is the number of pencils in each box. To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Then, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 * 8 = 24 pencils. She also has 2 loose pencils, so she has a total of 24 + 2 = 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. Together, they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all their pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

72 / 8 = 9

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the effect of the ice cubes and the effect of adding cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so the number of ice cubes needed is 65 / 13 = 5.

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, 5 ice cubes will make it 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Since any added liquid weakens the coffee, the total weakening effect of the cream is 15 milliliters.

Now, we add the weakening effects of the ice cubes and the cream to find the total weakening effect: 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio. For every 2 old records, 1 new record is given. Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of new records as 7. 

Since 5 people are trading, we can set up an equation to find the total number of old records. Let's denote the number of old records as 'x'. The ratio of old records to new records is 2:1. So, the total number of old records is 2 times the number of new records. 

Since 5 people are trading, we can set up the equation: 2x = 7 * 5 (because each person gets 7/5 new records, but since there are 5 people, we multiply by 5). 

Solving for x, we get: 
2x = 35 
x = 35 / 2 
x = 17.5 

Since you can't have half a record, we need to find the least common multiple of 2 and 5, which is 10. We can multiply both sides of the equation by 5 to get a whole number. 
2(5x) = 7(5) * 5 
10x = 175 
x = 175 / 10 
x = 17.5 * 5 / 5 
x = 17.5 * 1 
x = 17.5 * 2 / 2 
x = 35 / 2 * 2 / 2 
x = 35 / 2 
x = 17.5 

However, we can also solve this problem by using the ratio of old to new records. Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can set up the ratio 2:1. We can multiply the number of new records by 2 to find the number of old records. 
7 * 2 = 14 

However, this is the number of old records for 1 person. Since there are 5 people, we can multiply 14 by 5 to find the total number of old records. 
14 * 5 = 70 

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of junior programmers. The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. 

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, the monthly salary of a senior programmer is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers, which is 100 - 40 = 60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately.

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Monthly salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Monthly salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

Now, let's add the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers to find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.

Total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $184000

Initially, there were x people on the bus. 
At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total became x + 5. 
At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2. 
Then, 8 more people got in, so the total became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6. 
We are given that the total number of people at the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 20.

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: 
x = 20 - 6
x = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many lollipops Oscar has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
2. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
3. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
4. He eats 3 more lollipops that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
5. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first find the total number of percentage points it needs to charge. Since the phone is currently at 60% charged, it needs to charge from 60% to 100%. 

The difference between 100% and 60% is 40 percentage points. 

Since the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can find the total time it takes to charge 40 percentage points by multiplying 40 by 3. 

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone. 

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to follow the sequence of events:

1. Erin starts with 7 lollipops.
2. Her mother gives her 10 more lollipops, so now she has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.
3. Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so she is left with 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip, apply the rewards and the coupon to the current shopping trip, and then subtract the total from the amount spent on the current shopping trip.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip, so they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. Since they had 4 rewards, they used $4 off the price. 

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8. 

So, the total discount applied is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

To find out how much the customer paid, we subtract the total discount from the amount spent on the current shopping trip: $43 - $12 = $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"To determine which job pays more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

Job A: 
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per year: 2000
- Annual income: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B: 
- Annual income: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income before tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- State tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs, we subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the shares after the first year and then after the second year.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1 + 0.5 = 1.5).

New price after the first year = $8 * 1.5 = $12.

The stock price decreases by 25% in the second year. To find the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%, or 1 - 0.25 = 0.75).

New price after the second year = $12 * 0.75 = $9.

Now, we multiply the new price after the second year by the number of shares to find the final value of Maria's shares.

Final value = 8 * $9 = $72.

"Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Since the smallest group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from x:

x - 10 = 70 - 10
= 60

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as H. We are given that H = 2C, and the total number of animals is 60, so C + H = 60. 

Substituting H = 2C into the second equation, we get C + 2C = 60, which simplifies to 3C = 60. 

Dividing both sides by 3, we get C = 20. 

Since H = 2C, H = 2 * 20 = 40. 

Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. The total number of legs is 4C + 2H = 4 * 20 + 2 * 40 = 80 + 80 = 160.

Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. So, the total number of balls he was juggling before the incident is 3 + 4 = 7.

However, he drops 3 balls, but 2 of them are caught by the crowd. So, only 1 ball is lost.

Therefore, Josh starts juggling with 7 - 1 = 6 balls."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the weights of the other animals and then add them to the weight of the container.

Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can set up the following equations based on the given information:

1. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog: 
   Blue beetle = 50 pounds

2. The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog: 
   Green toad = 50 pounds

3. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog: 
   Yellow snake = 50 + 10 = 60 pounds

4. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog: 
   Red bird = 50 - 20 = 30 pounds

Now, we can find the total weight of the animals by adding their weights:
Total weight of animals = Pink frog + Blue beetle + Green toad + Yellow snake + Red bird
Total weight of animals = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds

Finally, we add the weight of the container to the total weight of the animals:
Total weight = Total weight of animals + Container weight
Total weight = 240 + 20 = 260 pounds

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 cookies per week.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies per week.

The total number of cookies used by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies per week.

Since each bag has 36 cookies, and 27 cookies are used by her son and husband, Jenny eats the remaining cookies. 

Jenny eats 36 - 27 = 9 cookies per week.

"To find the percentage increase, we need to first find the difference in the amount of money they make per day now and the amount they used to make per day. 

The factory used to make $100 per tractor and sold 10 tractors a day, so they made $100 * 10 = $1000 per day.

Now, they make $220 per silo and sell 5 silos a day, so they make $220 * 5 = $1100 per day.

The difference in the amount of money they make per day now and the amount they used to make per day is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

Time spent swimming: 6 / 2 = 3 hours
Time spent watching shows: 3 * 2 = 6 hours
Total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours

Since watching shows was 30% of the total time, we can set up the equation: 30% * Total time = 6 hours
To find the total time, we can divide both sides by 30% (or 0.3): Total time = 6 / 0.3 = 20 hours

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time: Time spent sightseeing = 40% * 20 hours = 0.4 * 20 = 8 hours

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is $5 per person. Since we don't know the number of friends yet, let's call it 'x'. The total cost for mini-golf will be 1 (Morgan) + x (friends) * $5.

The cost of arcade tokens is $5.

The cost of go-karts is $10 per ride, and Morgan and her friends will ride it twice. So, the total cost for go-karts will be 2 * ($10 + $10) = $40.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all activities: $5 (mini-golf) + $5 (arcade tokens) + $40 (go-karts) = $50.

Since Morgan has a budget of $90, we can set up the equation: 1 (Morgan) + x (friends) * $5 + $50 = $90.

Now, let's solve for x:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, let's find out how much change Billy had after buying the candy. Since he spent $1.5 per pound and he had $10, we can set up an equation to find the number of pounds of candy he bought. Let's call the number of pounds 'x'. The equation would be 1.5x = 10.

2. To find 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 1.5. x = 10 / 1.5 = 6.67 pounds. Since we can't buy a fraction of a pound, we'll round down to 6 pounds for now.

3. Now, let's find out how much change Billy had after buying the candy. The cost of the candy is 6 * 1.5 = $9. So, he had $10 - $9 = $1 left.

4. Billy then spent half of his change on gumballs. Half of $1 is $0.5. 

5. Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can find the number of gumballs he bought by dividing the amount he spent on gumballs by the cost of one gumball. 0.5 / 0.05 = 10 gumballs. However, we are given that he bought 40 gumballs, so our initial assumption of 6 pounds of candy was incorrect.

6. Let's go back to step 1 and recalculate the number of pounds of candy he bought. If he bought 40 gumballs and spent $0.5 on them, then he spent $0.05 * 40 = $2 on gumballs. 

7. Since he had $10 initially and spent $2 on gumballs, he had $10 - $2 = $8 left after buying the gumballs. 

8. The cost of the candy is $8, so we can set up an equation to find the number of pounds of candy he bought. 1.5x = 8.

9. To find 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 1.5. x = 8 / 1.5 = 5.33 pounds. Since we can't buy a fraction of a pound, we'll round down to 5 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. We are given that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45.

We are also given that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. This can be written as an equation: C = 2S - 5.

Substituting C = 45 into the equation, we get 45 = 2S - 5.

To solve for S, we need to isolate S on one side of the equation. First, we add 5 to both sides: 45 + 5 = 2S - 5 + 5, which simplifies to 50 = 2S.

Next, we divide both sides by 2: 50 / 2 = 2S / 2, which simplifies to 25 = S.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the three cities. 

Distance from the first city to the second city = 75 miles
Distance from the second city to the third city = 100 miles
Distance from the third city to the first city = 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs)
Total distance in one trip = 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is:
Total daily distance = 225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles/day

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total daily distance:
Days between services = Total distance before service / Total daily distance
= 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day
= 26.67 days

Since the train can't travel a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of days it goes between services, so we will round down to 26.67 days."

The number of boys present = Total number of boys - Number of boys absent = 53 - 4 = 49

Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49.

The final answer is: 49"
"To find the total number of kids in the park, we need to find the number of boys and add it to the number of girls. 

Since there are twice the number of boys as girls, and there are 6 girls, we can find the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2. 

Number of boys = 2 * 6 = 12

Now, we can find the total number of kids by adding the number of boys and girls.

Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls
= 12 + 6
= 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test, we need to subtract the points she has already scored from the total required points. 

Total required points = 42
Points scored on the first test = 15
Points scored on the second test = 18

Points scored so far = 15 + 18 = 33
Points needed on the third test = Total required points - Points scored so far

"Let's break down the information given:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S. 
   We can write the equation: S = 4 * 3 - 5
   S = 12 - 5
   S = 7
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V. 
   We can write the equation: V = 3 * S
   V = 3 * 7
   V = 21
4. If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, we can write the equation: 
   Total = 3 (refusing to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) + X (other reasons)
   50 = 3 + 7 + 21 + X
   50 = 31 + X
   X = 50 - 31
   X = 19

The final answer is: 19"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Erin now has 14 points. Sara scored 8 points. Erin has three times more points than Sara. 

Let's represent Sara's points as S and Erin's points as E. We know that E = 3S. We also know that E = 14. 

Since E = 3S and E = 14, we can set up the equation 3S = 14. 

To find S, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3. 

S = 14 / 3
S = 4.67

Now that we know Sara's points, we can find Erin's points before. We know that Erin now has 14 points. To find Erin's points before, we need to subtract the points Sara scored from Erin's current points. 

Erin's points before = Erin's current points - Sara's points
Erin's points before = 14 - 8
Erin's points before = 6

However, the question asks for Erin's points before, which implies the points before Erin scored 14. Since Erin now has 14 points and Sara scored 8, Erin's points before must be 14 - 8 = 6 points more than Sara's points before. 

Let's represent Erin's points before as E_before and Sara's points before as S_before. We know that E_before = S_before + 6. We also know that E_before + 8 = 14. 

We can set up the equation E_before + 8 = 14. 

To find E_before, we need to subtract 8 from both sides of the equation. 

E_before = 14 - 8
E_before = 6

However, we know that E_before = S_before + 6. We also know that E_before = 6. 

We can set up the equation S_before + 6 = 6. 

To find S_before, we need to subtract 6 from both sides of the equation. 

S_before = 6 - 6
S_before = 0

Now that we know Sara's points before, we can find Erin's points before. We know that Erin's points before = Sara's points before + 6. 

Erin's points before = S_before + 6
Erin's points before = 0 + 6
Erin's points before = 6

However, this is the same as the previous answer. This is because the points before Erin scored 14 is the same as the points before Sara scored 8, which is 0. 

The final answer is: 0"
"To find the total cost of the picture frames, we first need to calculate the cost of etching the logo. The cost of etching is 20% of the cost of the picture frame, which is $20. 

20% of $20 is 0.2 * $20 = $4. 

So, the total cost of each picture frame, including etching, is $20 + $4 = $24.

Since 44 seniors need to receive picture frames, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2 seniors will receive pins, so the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 1/4 * 44 = 11 officers.

Each officer will receive a cord, so the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

The total cost of the senior gifts is the sum of the cost of the picture frames, the pins, and the cords: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final numerical answer is: $1198"
"To find the total cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the materials cost first. 

The original price of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

Since making it DIY saves 20%, we can calculate the materials cost as follows:

Materials cost = Original price - (Original price * 20%)
Materials cost = $400 - (400 * 0.20)
Materials cost = $400 - $80
Materials cost = $320

So, the total cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold on each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday, which is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is 50 * 2 = 100.

The final answer is: 100"

"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to find the value of the faulty pieces of equipment. 

The total value of the equipment is $400,000. 40% of this is faulty. 

40% of $400,000 = 0.4 * $400,000 = $160,000

This means the faulty pieces of equipment are worth $160,000. 

To find the value of the functioning pieces of equipment, we subtract the value of the faulty pieces from the total value.

Value of functioning pieces = Total value - Value of faulty pieces
= $400,000 - $160,000
= $240,000

The total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

The final answer is: $240,000"
"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from the half of the sheep that gives 1 kg of milk and the half that gives 2 kg of milk.

Half of the 30 sheep is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep. 
These 15 sheep give 1 kg of milk each, so the total milk from this half is 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

The other half of the 30 sheep is also 15 sheep. 
These 15 sheep give 2 kg of milk each, so the total milk from this half is 15 * 2 = 30 kg.

The total milk Mary collects every day is 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her children. 

Mrs. Sherman started with a dozen rolls, which is 12 rolls. She fed 6 children, so she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left.

Since she broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces, we need to multiply the number of remaining rolls by 8. 

6 rolls * 8 pieces/roll = 48 pieces

So, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we need to first find the number of pupils who like blue, then the number of pupils who like green, and finally subtract the sum of these two from the total number of pupils.

The remaining pupils who do not like blue are 40 - 20 = 20.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. So, the number of pupils who like green is 20 / 4 = 5.

The remaining pupils who do not like blue or green like yellow. So, the number of pupils who like yellow is 20 - 5 = 15.

"To find out how many socks Lindsay has washed, we need to calculate the total number of socks from the pairs and the loose socks. 

Since each pair of socks contains 2 socks, washing 10 pairs of socks means Lindsay has washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks from the pairs. 

Adding the 15 loose socks, Lindsay has washed a total of 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks that need washing, to find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks that need washing: 50 - 35 = 15.

"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest paid over the five months and then divide it by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest paid over the five months. 

The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time
Here, Principal = $3,650, Rate = 10% or 0.10, Time = 5 months.

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we need to add the interest to the principal to find the total amount Karan needs to pay back.
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we divide the total amount by the number of months.
Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
Monthly Payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly Payment = $1,095

The final answer is: $1,095"

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos they have separately and then add them together.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos they have together:
Total silver pesos = 50 (Axel's) + 100 (Anna's) = 150
Total gold pesos = 80 (Axel's) + 120 (Anna's) = 200

The total number of pesos they have together is the sum of the total silver pesos and total gold pesos:
Total pesos = Total silver pesos + Total gold pesos = 150 + 200 = 350

"To find the total profit per hour, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she bought enough supplies for 3 pitchers, she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue will be 36 * $1 = $36.

Now, we need to find the profit. The profit is the total revenue minus the initial cost. The initial cost is $18. So, the profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

However, we need to find the profit per hour. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we need to find out how many hours it takes her to sell all the lemonade. Since she has 36 cups of lemonade, and she sells 4 cups per hour, it will take her 36 / 4 = 9 hours to sell all the lemonade.

Now, we can find the profit per hour by dividing the total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 = $2.

"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of land as x hectares.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his initial land. We are given that he had 12.8 hectares left.

We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2 to isolate x:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of female members in the choir, we first need to calculate 50% of 52, which is the total number of members. 

50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

Since there are 26 female members, and half of them can't make it to the show, we need to find half of 26.

Half of 26 = 26 / 2 = 13

Now, we have 13 female members who can make it to the show. The choir's 3 teachers will also be singing, so we need to add them to the number of female members.

Total number of people who sang in the performance = 13 + 3 = 16

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu.

First, let's find the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and the number of messages to Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

Since Monica wants to make a bow for each gift, she will need to use the total amount of ribbon for 12 gifts. 

Total ribbon = 144 inches

Now, we can divide the total ribbon by the total number of gifts to find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow.

Ribbon per gift = Total ribbon / Total gifts
Ribbon per gift = 144 / 12
Ribbon per gift = 12

"To find out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, he needs 4 times the amount of each ingredient. 

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs to buy:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs to buy:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the energy used by the air conditioner in a day. 

The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Since there are 8 hours of usage, the total energy used in a day is:
900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, the new usage time is:
8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours per day.

The new energy used in a day is:
900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours or 2.7 kWh per day.

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original and new usage:
7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh per day.

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy saved by 30:
4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh.

The total number of stripes is 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.
The total number of zebras is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

The average number of stripes is the total number of stripes divided by the total number of zebras, which is 88 / 4 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find out how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to determine how many sandwiches he needs to make and then calculate the total cost of the ingredients.

Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people in total, we need to divide 20 by 4 to find out how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, Tyson will need 5 pounds of each ingredient:

Meat needed: 5 pounds
Cheese needed: 5 pounds

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:

5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:

5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

To find the total cost of the ingredients, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:

$35.00 (meat) + $15.00 (cheese) = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis initially. Since he has 40 cannolis, he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns initially.

2. Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store. So, the total number of cannolis now is 40 + 60 = 100.

3. He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he bought 60 cannolis, he bought 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

4. Now, Allan has 80 (initial corns) + 20 (new corns) = 100 corns.

5. To find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis, we add the total number of corns (100) and the total number of cannolis (100).

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first determine how many steps he had completed before his jog. 

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps he completed before his jog would be 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. 

Total steps wanted: 10,000
Steps completed before jog: 6,000
Steps left after jog: 2,000

Steps taken during jog = Total steps wanted - Steps completed before jog - Steps left after jog
Steps taken during jog = 10,000 - 6,000 - 2,000
Steps taken during jog = 2,000

The final answer is: 2000"
"To find out how many minutes it will take Toby to read the book, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book and then divide it by his reading rate.

Total number of words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Time taken to read the book = Total number of words / Reading rate = 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Since it takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, Toby will be at the airport in 30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes.

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, so to find out how many minutes early he will be, we subtract the time he will arrive from the time he has to be there:

Time early = 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked for 40 hours a week and was paid $15 per hour. So, the total amount paid to each employee in May is:

40 hours/week * $15/hour = $600/week

Since there are 4 weeks in May, the total amount paid to each employee in May is:

$600/week * 4 weeks = $2400

The total amount paid to all employees in May is:

40 employees * $2400/employee = $96,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of 40 employees left, or 10 employees. So, the number of employees remaining in June is:

40 employees - 10 employees = 30 employees

Each employee still worked for 40 hours a week and was paid $15 per hour. So, the total amount paid to each employee in June is:

40 hours/week * $15/hour = $600/week

Since there are 4 weeks in June, the total amount paid to each employee in June is:

$600/week * 4 weeks = $2400

The total amount paid to all employees in June is:

30 employees * $2400/employee = $72,000

The total amount paid to the employees in the two months is:

$96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000

The final answer is: $168,000"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and subtract that from the initial $10.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that the second pound is half off, so the cost of the second pound is $3 * 0.5 = $1.5. The total cost of 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.5 = $4.5.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. Sally bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.5 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total amount spent by Tim, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework separately and then add them together.

The first package of fireworks costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is 2 * $400 = $800. 

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks, we need to calculate the discount amount first. The discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.2 * $1200 = $240.

The discounted cost of the fireworks is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the fireworks. The total amount spent by Tim is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate how many cookies she will eat in 30 days and then divide that number by the number of cookies her recipe makes.

Shannon eats 2 cookies a night, so in 30 days, she will eat 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she will eat by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make.

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5 dozens

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two events. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50000 candles smell like wet dog, so the number of candles that smell like wet dog is 0.05 * 50000 = 2500.

Next, we need to find the number of candles that are more dangerous and have a 1% chance of exploding. However, the problem states that 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog, and the remaining 95% do not. Since 5% of the candles smell like wet dog, 95% of the more dangerous candles do not smell like wet dog. 

Let's assume the number of more dangerous candles is x. Then, 0.05x = 2500 (since 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog). Solving for x, we get x = 2500 / 0.05 = 50000.

However, this is the total number of candles, not the number of more dangerous candles. Since 95% of the more dangerous candles do not smell like wet dog, 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog. So, the number of more dangerous candles that smell like wet dog is 0.05 * 50000 = 2500.

Now, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. The problem states that 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, so 1% of the candles are more dangerous and can explode. Since 2500 candles are more dangerous and smell like wet dog, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 0.01 * 2500 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to find the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount amount is 30% of the regular price, which is 0.3 * $20 = $6. 

So, the discounted price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The average trees are not specified, so let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as 'x'.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 45 + x.
The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can set up the equation: (45 + x) + 105 = 500.

Simplifying the equation, we get 150 + x = 500.

Subtracting 150 from both sides, we get x = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The total number of heads is 180, which means C + D = 180.
2. The total number of bumps (humps) is 304, which means 2C + D = 304 (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump).

We can solve this system of linear equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the information given.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 
30% of 800 km = 0.3 * 800 = 240 km
So, the total distance covered in the next two days is 240 km.

The total distance covered in the first 6 days is:
800 km + 240 km = 1040 km

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance covered is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

The total distance covered during the two-week-long trip is:
1040 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from Peter's locker size. 

Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can find Zack's locker size by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4. 

Zack's locker size = 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches.

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can find Timothy's locker size by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 20 * 2 = 40 cubic inches.

"To find the elevation where Stanley's comb fell, we need to subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation. 

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation where the comb fell: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation where the comb fell and Oliver's elevation to determine how much Oliver needs to climb.

Elevation where the comb fell: 6,000 feet
Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital.
2. The first bank gave him $4000.
3. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.
4. To find the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from the banks, we add the amounts from both banks: $4000 + $8000 = $12000.
5. Now, we add the initial capital to the total amount received from the banks: $5000 + $12000 = $16000.

"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20.
3. Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30.
4. 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5: (3/5) * 30 = (3 * 30) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.
5. Now, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different periods and calculate the cost for each period.

1. The first 6 months were $8 a month, so the cost for this period is:
6 months * $8/month = $48

2. The next 8 months were $12 a month, so the cost for this period is:
8 months * $12/month = $96

3. The remaining months after the first 14 months (6 + 8) are 12 months (24 months - 12 months = 12 months). The price for these months is $14 a month, so the cost for this period is:
12 months * $14/month = $168

Now, let's add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years:
$48 + $96 + $168 = $312

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $312."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. 
   Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J. 
   We can write the equation: J = T - 6.

2. The total savings is $6. 
   Since Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 2/3 from the tattered jeans. 
   We can write the equation: (1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6.

3. Substitute J from the first equation into the second equation: 
   (1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6.

4. Multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 
   T - 6 + 2T = 18.

5. Combine like terms: 
   3T - 6 = 18.

6. Add 6 to both sides of the equation: 
   3T = 24.

7. Divide both sides of the equation by 3: 
   T = 8.

8. Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans (T = 8), we can find the cost of the jogger jeans (J) using the equation J = T - 6: 
   J = 8 - 6 = 2.

9. The jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many birds each type of feeder attracts and then add them up.

Let's denote the number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders as x. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders is x + 10.

Lillian has 3 store-bought feeders and 3 homemade feeders. So, the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is 3x, and the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10).

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden is the sum of the birds attracted by the store-bought and homemade feeders. We are given that each bird feeder attracts 20 birds, so we can set up the equation:

3x + 3(x + 10) = 20 * 6

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x + 3x + 30 = 120

Combine like terms:

6x + 30 = 120

Subtract 30 from both sides:

6x = 90

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 15

Now that we know x, we can find the number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders:

Number of birds attracted by homemade feeders = 3(x + 10) = 3(15 + 10) = 3 * 25 = 75

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden is the sum of the birds attracted by the store-bought and homemade feeders:

Total number of birds = 3x + 3(x + 10) = 3 * 15 + 3 * 25 = 45 + 75 = 120

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how many cards he sold. Since he has $50 in spending cash and the ticket costs $100, he needs to make $50 from selling the cards. 

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as 'x'. Since he keeps 1/3 of the cards, he sells 2/3 of the cards. The selling price of each card is $1.5. 

The total amount of money he makes from selling the cards is 2/3 * x * $1.5. This amount should be equal to $50 (the amount he needs to make to buy the ticket).

We can set up the equation: 
(2/3) * x * $1.5 = $50

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2 to get:
x * $1.5 = $50 * (3/2)
x * $1.5 = $75

Now, we can divide both sides by $1.5 to find x:
x = $75 / $1.5
x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards. 

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many hotdogs the caterer prepared. Since he prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, he prepared for 36 / 2 = 18 guests to have two hotdogs. This means he prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that 40 guests in total wanted hotdogs, and since 36 hotdogs were already prepared, 40 - 36 = 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine how much gas was in each container. 

15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, so each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons of gas.

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, we need to find 1/4 of 3 gallons. 

1/4 of 3 gallons is (1/4) * 3 = 0.75 gallons.

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we need to convert 0.75 gallons to pints. 

0.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George had left after buying the chips. Since he had 1% of his money left, that means he spent 99% of his money. 

Let's assume George had x dollars initially. Then, 99% of x is the amount he spent on chips and candy bars. We know that he spent $5, so we can set up the equation:

0.99x = 5

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.99:

x = 5 / 0.99
x = 5.05

So, George had $5.05 initially. Now, let's find out how much he spent on chips. We know that he bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so the total cost of chips is:

3 * 0.40 = 1.20

Now, we subtract the cost of chips from the total amount he spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

5 - 1.20 = 3.80

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the total amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find out how many candy bars he bought:

3.80 / 0.75 = 5.07

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 5 candy bars with $3.75 and have $0.05 left, which is not enough to buy another candy bar. Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine how many lollipops he shared with his friends. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself, so he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his friends.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among 4 friends, we need to divide the number of lollipops shared by the number of friends: 20 / 4 = 5.

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to first find out how much cake was eaten by Rory and her mom. 

Since they each had a piece, and there are 8 pieces in total, they each had 1/8 of the cake. 

So, together they had 2/8 of the cake. 

To find the weight of the cake they ate, we need to multiply the fraction of the cake they ate by the total weight of the cake. 

2/8 * 20 ounces = (2/8) * (20/1) = 40/8 = 5 ounces.

Now, to find the weight of the remaining cake, we subtract the weight of the cake they ate from the total weight of the cake.

Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which costs 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then add 5 minutes to that time to determine how early she should leave.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

So, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. 

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so 3 yards is equal to 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length * width = area. We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width: width = area / length. 

Plugging in the values we know, we get width = 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

Now that we have the width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula perimeter = 2 * (length + width). Plugging in the values we know, we get perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 feet.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads they bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Difference in beads = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
= 140 - 60
= 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven is on for 3 hours, and it raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase is 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window. The window is open for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes, so for 30 minutes, it cools down 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the final temperature. The initial temperature is 40 degrees. The temperature increase due to the oven is 15 degrees, and the temperature decrease due to the open window is 6 degrees. So, the final temperature is 40 + 15 - 6 = 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took James to complete the swim and bike ride. 

The time it took Jon to complete the swim is 40 minutes. James finishes the swim 10% faster, so we need to find 10% of 40 minutes and subtract it from 40 minutes. 

10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. So, James finishes the swim in 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

The time it took Jon to complete the bike ride is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. James takes 5 minutes longer, so James takes 80 + 5 = 85 minutes to complete the bike ride.

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. This means that the total time it took James to complete the triathlon is 10 minutes more than the total time it took Jon. 

The total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes. 

Since James took 10 minutes longer than Jon, the total time it took James to complete the triathlon is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

We know that James took 36 minutes to complete the swim and 85 minutes to complete the bike ride. To find the time it took James to complete the run, we need to subtract the time it took him to complete the swim and bike ride from the total time it took him to complete the triathlon.

Time taken by James to complete the run = Total time taken by James - (Time taken by James to complete the swim + Time taken by James to complete the bike ride)
= 180 - (36 + 85)
= 180 - 121
= 59 minutes

The final answer is: 59"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then divide it by 4.

Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so it is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so it is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we first need to find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes. Since the horse runs at 32MPH, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed * Time

However, the time needs to be in hours. We convert 30 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

30 minutes / 60 = 0.5 hours

Now we can calculate the distance:

Distance = 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, we multiply the distance by 1/2:

Hay eaten = 16 miles * 1/2 = 8 bails

Each bail costs $3, so we multiply the number of bails by the cost:

Total cost = 8 bails * $3/bail = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, so we multiply the number of bills by the value of each bill:

Total money = 6 * $5 = $30

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the total money:

Change = Total money - Total cost
= $30 - $24
= $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to calculate the number of eggs in the cases and add the loose eggs. 

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so to find out how many glasses Rozanne can make, we divide the total number of eggs by 5. 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

"To find out how many points Joey has after his turn, we need to add the points he scored to his initial points. 

Joey's initial points: 214
Points scored by Joey: 26
Joey's total points after his turn: 214 + 26 = 240

To find out how many points Marcy has after her turn, we need to add the points she scored to her initial points.

Marcy's initial points: 225
Points scored by Marcy: 10
Marcy's total points after her turn: 225 + 10 = 235

Now, we need to find the difference between Joey's total points and Marcy's total points to determine by how many points Joey is winning.

Joey's total points: 240
Marcy's total points: 235
Difference: 240 - 235 = 5

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday:
17 sneakers were sold for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 x $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sale to the department store:
The salesman had 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.
These were sold for $25 each, so the revenue from the department store sale is:
31 x $25 = $775

The total revenue from both sales is:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The initial cost of the case of sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The salesman's profit is $539."
"To find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets with eight pieces each and the four packets with sixteen pieces each.

First, let's calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets with eight pieces each:
6 packets * 8 crayons/packet = 48 crayons

Next, let's calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets with sixteen pieces each:
4 packets * 16 crayons/packet = 64 crayons

Now, let's add the total number of crayons from both types of packets:
48 crayons + 64 crayons = 112 crayons

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra.
2. The regular price of a soda is $3.
3. If you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2, it means the total cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda without the super ticket is $20 - $2 = $18.

Since the super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra, the cost of the movie ticket alone is $20 - $1 = $19. 

Now, let's consider the cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a soda and popcorn at regular price. The total cost in this case is $12 (movie ticket) + $3 (soda) + x (popcorn price) = $18 (total cost without the super ticket).

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

12 + 3 + x = 18

Combine like terms:

15 + x = 18

Subtract 15 from both sides:

x = 3

The regular price of popcorn is $3."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is:

New cost = Original cost + Increase
New cost = 45 + 20
New cost = 65

Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new cost. 

Total cost = New cost * Number of balloons
Total cost = 65 * 170
Total cost = 11050

The final answer is: 11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 mph x 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 mph x 1 hour
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles
Total Distance = 150 miles

The total time taken is the sum of the time taken at 60 mph and 30 mph:
Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour
Total Time = 3 hours

Now, we can calculate the average speed:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies separately and then add them together.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires is:
8 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $6400

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she now has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left. The value of the sapphires remains the same, $6400.

The value of the 2 rubies she received in the trade is:
2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400

Now, we add the value of the sapphires and rubies together:
$6400 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $8800

The total value of Jenna's jewels is $8800.

The final answer is: $8800"
"To find the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. So together, they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, we multiply the total number of apples they eat per day by 30 to find the total number of apples they eat in 30 days: 8 * 30 = 240.

"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so the total number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we first need to determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of red cards = 15
60% of red cards = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the number of fairies remaining, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

After 20 minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means that 50 / 2 = 25 fairies joined the group from the east.

So, the total number of fairies now is 50 (initial fairies) + 25 (new fairies) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. 

The number of fairies remaining is 75 - 30 = 45.

"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has and the number of puppies Brandon's dog has. 

Total puppies = 8 (Jennifer's dog) + 12 (Brandon's dog) = 20 puppies

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. 

Puppies with spots = 3 (Jennifer's dog) + 4 (Brandon's dog) = 7 puppies

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and add them together.

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Total weight of feed = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips needed.

Number of trips = Total weight of feed / Truck's capacity
= 3400 / 2250
= 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week. Since an aluminum can is worth 2 cents, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week. Since a plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

In a four-week month, Grayson's total earnings from aluminum cans are 6 * 4 = 24 cents.

In a four-week month, Grayson's total earnings from plastic bottles are 15 * 4 = 60 cents.

Now, we add the total earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles to find the total earnings in a four-week month: 24 + 60 = 84 cents.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as (x/2) + 2.

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation: (x/2) + 2 = 5.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: (x/2) = 5 - 2, which simplifies to (x/2) = 3.

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: x = 3 * 2, which simplifies to x = 6.

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit. Since the length of the shark is given in feet, we'll convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. 

1 foot = 12 inches
6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet

There are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents. 

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / length of shark) * 100

"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first find out how many books Sarah bought in total. We know that she spent $300 on the books and each book costs $15. 

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we need to divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child got.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / Number of children
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids who are allergic to at least one thing. 

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find this. The formula is: Total = A + B - Both, where A is the number of kids allergic to dairy, B is the number of kids allergic to peanuts, and Both is the number of kids allergic to both.

A = 9 (kids allergic to dairy)
B = 6 (kids allergic to peanuts)
Both = 3 (kids allergic to both)

Total allergic = A + B - Both
Total allergic = 9 + 6 - 3
Total allergic = 12

Now, we know that there are 32 kids in the class. To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the total number of kids allergic from the total number of kids in the class.

Kids not allergic = Total kids - Total allergic
Kids not allergic = 32 - 12
Kids not allergic = 20

Next, let's find the total number of tour guides: 
3 groups * 7 tour guides per group = 3 * 7 = 21 tour guides

Now, let's add the total number of employees and tour guides: 
600 employees + 21 tour guides = 621 people

The final answer is: 621"
"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal, so the new price is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

The final answer is: $16,400"
"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to determine the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint he has.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

In total, Jasper has 2 + 9 = 11 tubes of paint.

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to find the weight of the 2010 penny. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can set up the following equation:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny

Given that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48
Weight of 2010 penny = 36

Now that we know the weight of the 2010 penny, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their weights:

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 + 36
Combined weight = 84

The final answer is: 84"

Now, let's subtract the total amount they have earned from their goal: 
$200 (goal) - $174 (total earned) = $26

They need to earn $26 more to reach their goal."
"To find out how many songs Luri has, we need to multiply the number of songs Gabriel has by 3. 

Gabriel has 20 songs, and Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. 
Luri has 20 * 3 = 60 songs.

Now, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their player. 
The maximum capacity of the player is 100 songs. 
Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs to his player.
Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs to his player.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add than Gabriel, we need to subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add.
80 - 40 = 40

"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to first find out how many oranges he ate. 

They picked 60 oranges and Stetson ate 2/5 of them. 

2/5 of 60 can be calculated as (2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24.

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. 

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange he ate, the total amount of money he gave up is 24 * 10 = $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

Cost of shoes = $80
3 times the cost of shoes = 3 * $80 = $240

Since the handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes, we subtract $20 from $240.

Cost of handbag = 3 times the cost of shoes - $20
= $240 - $20
= $220

"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to first calculate the total miles he runs in a week. 

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so the total miles he runs in a week is 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week.

Since James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed. 

Total hours = Total miles / Speed
Total hours = 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
Total hours = 6 hours/week

"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day. 

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day. So, each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

For five days, the total amount of oats consumed is 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. To find out how many bags Uncle Ben needs, we divide the total amount of oats consumed by the amount in each bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

"To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we first need to find the total number of Pomeranians. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate this as follows:

Total puppies = 27
Pomeranians = (2/3) * Total puppies
Pomeranians = (2/3) * 27
Pomeranians = 18

Now, we need to find the number of girl Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can calculate this as follows:

Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * Pomeranians
Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * 18
Girl Pomeranians = 6

The final answer is: 6"

Highest temperature in Southlandia = -48Â°F
Highest temperature in Northlandia = 21Â°F
Highest temperature in Midlandia = -3Â°F

Total highest temperature = -48 + 21 - 3 = -30
Average highest temperature = Total highest temperature / 3

"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to save. 

The toy car costs $12, and he already has $4. So, the remaining amount he needs to save is $12 - $4 = $8.

He promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take to save $8, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings:

$8 / $2 = 4

Therefore, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money.

"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to calculate the total number of eggs that can fit on the 2 trays and subtract that from the total number of eggs he has.

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays, so the total number of eggs that can fit on the trays is 24 * 2 = 48.

Jaime has 64 eggs, and 48 can fit on the trays, so the number of eggs that won't fit is 64 - 48 = 16.

"To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and coupon.

Since the razors are buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost of 2 packs of razors will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors. 

To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to divide the total cost by the number of razors: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25 per razor.

To convert dollars to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them up.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each, so their total height is 4 * 64 = 256 inches.

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 3 * 64 = 192 inches.

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128 inches.

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 636 / 12 = 53 feet.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Angela's current age be x.

In four years, Angela's age will be x + 4.

According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is 14 years old now, in four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

So, we can set up the equation: x + 4 = 3 * 14

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 4 = 42

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get: x = 38

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old.

The cost of the afternoon rides is the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides: 
$2 (cost per ride) * 14 (number of days) = $28

Now, we add the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides to find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car:
$84 + $28 = $112

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

One greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, so they can make 120 / 3 = 40 pies.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

For the first venue, the total cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 per guest, so the total cost is 200 + 5x.

For the second venue, the total cost is $25 per guest, so the total cost is 25x.

Since we want the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable. Subtract 5x from both sides of the equation:

200 = 20x

Now, divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by Bodhi as B, David as D, and Lily as L. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write an equation: L = D + 7.

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write another equation: D = B/2.

We are also given that together they collected 43 insects, so the sum of the insects found by each of them is 43: L + D + B = 43.

Now we can substitute the first equation into the third equation: (D + 7) + D + B = 43.

Combine like terms: 2D + B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2D + B = 36.

Now substitute the second equation into this one: 2(B/2) + B = 36.

Simplify the equation: B + B/2 = 36.

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2B + B = 72.

Combine like terms: 3B = 72.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 24.

Now that we know Bodhi found 24 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: D = B/2 = 24/2 = 12.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: L = D + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we multiply 364 by 1/4 to find the yards used by Mariah:
364 * 1/4 = 364 * 0.25 = 91 yards

Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn. We multiply 364 by 1/2 to find the yards used by her grandma:
364 * 1/2 = 364 * 0.5 = 182 yards

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total yards used:
91 yards (Mariah) + 182 yards (grandma) = 273 yards

The final answer is: 273"
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the number of gifts for her friends and add the 10 random gifts.

First, let's calculate the number of gifts for her friends:
- 2 friends want 5 gifts each, so 2 x 5 = 10 gifts
- 3 friends want 2 gifts each, so 3 x 2 = 6 gifts
- Total gifts for friends = 10 + 6 = 16 gifts

Now, let's add the 10 random gifts:
- Total gifts = 16 (for friends) + 10 (random gifts) = 26 gifts

"Let's break down the information given:

- Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.
- 2 packs are strawberry gum.
- 1 pack is grape gum, which costs $2.
- 1 pack is green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum, so it costs $2 / 2 = $1.
- The total cost of all the gum is $7.

We know that the total cost of the 4 packs of gum is $7. We also know that 3 of the packs (2 strawberry and 1 green apple) cost $2 + $1 = $3. 

So, the cost of the remaining pack (grape gum) is $7 - $3 = $4. 

Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, we can find the cost of each pack by dividing the total cost of the strawberry gum by 2. The total cost of the strawberry gum is $7 - $2 - $1 = $4. 

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $4 / 2 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar spent. 

Let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

For a 2 x 4, Frederick gets 200 sticks for $4. 
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

For a 2 x 8, Frederick gets 400 sticks for $6.
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since a 2 x 8 gives him the most sticks per dollar, we will use this type of wood. 

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24:
Number of 2 x 8 pieces = $24 / $6 = 4

Now, let's calculate the total number of sticks he can get from 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood:
Total sticks = 4 * 400 = 1600

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we need to first determine the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24. Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes required is 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair. The cost per pair is $12.00, so the total cost is 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips for a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

The weekly bus pass costs $20. To find out how much Janet would save, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips: $22 - $20 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. This means the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Total number of animals in the farm and the zoo combined: 40 + 80 = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to first determine the total number of items Rose bought. Since Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, the total number of items she bought is 12 + 4 = 16.

We are told that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. Let's represent the number of items Sophia bought as 'x'. Then, the number of items Rose bought is 4x. Since we know Rose bought 16 items, we can set up the equation 4x = 16.

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 16 / 4 = 4.

Since 'x' represents the number of items Sophia bought, and we know that Sophia bought a combination of onions and potatoes, we can assume that the ratio of onions to potatoes is the same as Rose's, which is 12:4 or 3:1. Therefore, Sophia bought 3/4 of the total items as onions and 1/4 as potatoes.

The total number of items Sophia bought is 4. To find the number of onions, we multiply 4 by 3/4: 4 * 3/4 = 3. To find the number of potatoes, we multiply 4 by 1/4: 4 * 1/4 = 1.

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 3 + 1 = 4."
"To find the total number of days Andy has to lose the weight, we need to subtract his birthday from the current date. 

December 31st to July 19th is approximately 6 months and 19 days. 

There are 30 days in a month, so 6 months is 6 * 30 = 180 days. 

Adding the remaining 19 days, we get 180 + 19 = 199 days.

Since Andy wants to lose 30 lbs, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 lb, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 105,000 / 199 â‰ˆ 527 calories.

The final answer is: 527"
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate his total earnings for the week and then subtract the amount he spent.

Since Gerald works 7 days a week, his total earnings for the week would be 7 days * $30/day = $210.

Gerald spent a total of $100, so to find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings: $210 - $100 = $110.

Therefore, Gerald has $110 left."
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total distance she will run. 

Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, we multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap: 
8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Now, we know Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. To find out how many milliliters she needs to drink for 2 km, we multiply the distance by the amount of water per kilometer:
2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

First, Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes. 
20% of $500 = 0.2 * $500 = $100

Now, we subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, we subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount:
$400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie had $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can set up the equation: x + 3x = 120,000.

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000.

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we can find the cost of the house by multiplying x by 3: 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

The final answer is: $90,000."
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the canvas bags, which is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack * $4 per bag = 8 * 5 * 4 = $160.

The total revenue is the selling price of the bags, which is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $64 - $160 = -$96. However, since profit cannot be negative, it seems there is an error in the problem. 

However, if we assume that the problem is asking for the profit per bag, then the profit per bag is ($8 - $4) = $4 per bag. The total profit would be 8 bags * $4 per bag = $32.

If we assume that the problem is asking for the profit, then the answer is $32."
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he threw punches in and multiply it by the average number of punches per minute.

A fight lasts 5 rounds of 3 minutes each, so the total number of minutes is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, the total number of punches he threw is 15 * 25 = 375 punches.

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, we can find out how many cookies Kelsie made. Since Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Ali has: 
   Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. 
   Total money from $10 bills = 4 * $10 = $40
   Total money from $20 bills = 6 * $20 = $120
   Total money = $40 + $120 = $160

2. Ali gives his sister half of the total money:
   Half of the total money = $160 / 2 = $80
   Money left after giving his sister half = $160 - $80 = $80

3. Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner:

1 hour = 60 minutes
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. Let's first find double the time it takes Rob:

Double the time it takes Rob = 2 * 120 = 240 minutes

Now, we add 40 minutes to this to find the time it takes Royce:

"To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to calculate the total number of problems he completed on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, and then subtract that from the total number of problems.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems.

On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed on Monday and Tuesday is 12 + 36 = 48.

On Wednesday, he completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems. The remaining problems are 100 - 48 = 52. One-quarter of 52 is 52 / 4 = 13.

So, the total number of problems completed on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday is 48 + 13 = 61.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.

To find the number of rows of blue tulips, we need to divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

Number of blue tulips = 24
Number of tulips per row = 8
Number of rows of blue tulips = 24 / 8 = 3

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips. However, we need to find the total number of rows.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to first determine how many cups of raisins she has available for the oatmeal cookies. 

Since she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each of these will get 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

However, the question asks how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make, and each batch takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches she can make, we need to divide the total raisins available for oatmeal cookies by the amount needed per batch.

Since she has 9 cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies, we need to find out how many 3/4 cups are in 9 cups. To do this, we can convert 3/4 to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 3/4 = 0.75. 

Now, we can divide 9 by 0.75 to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make: 9 / 0.75 = 12.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device, then find the difference in the total cost.

Ada's daily consumption before adding the new device is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption is 12 * 24 = 288 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. Her daily consumption will be 14 * 24 = 336 kWh per day.

Ada's weekly consumption before adding the new device is 288 * 7 = 2016 kWh per week.

Ada's weekly consumption after adding the new device is 336 * 7 = 2352 kWh per week.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kWh. So, Ada's weekly bill before adding the new device is 2016 * $1.50 = $3024.

Ada's weekly bill after adding the new device is 2352 * $1.50 = $3540.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $3540 - $3024 = $516.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it would take one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take them twice as long to paint a whole house. 

So, it would take one person 5 days * 2 = 10 days to paint a whole house.

Next, we need to find out how long it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house. If one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, then 5 people can paint a whole house in 10 days / 5 = 2 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we need to convert 2 days into hours. 

2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.
5. To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have: 20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 64 (Jenna's sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 152.

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we first need to determine how many CDs he could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set. 

Let's denote the number of CDs Tom bought as 'x' and the number of headphones as 'y'. We know that the total cost of the items is $48, and the cost of one CD is $4. 

The cost of the headphones can be represented as (48 - 4x), since Tom spent $4 on each CD. 

We also know that the total cost of the items is $48, so we can set up the equation: 4x + (48 - 4x) = 48.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 48 - 4x + 4x = 48, which simplifies to 48 = 48.

However, this equation doesn't give us any useful information. We need to consider the cost of the headphones separately. Let's assume the cost of the headphones is 'h'. Then, we can set up the equation: 4x + h = 48.

We know that Tom spent $48 in total, and we also know that he spent $4 on the CD. So, the cost of the headphones is (48 - 4x). 

Now, we can set up the equation: 4x + (48 - 4x) = 48. However, this equation is still not useful. 

Let's try a different approach. We know that Tom spent $48 in total, and he spent $4 on the CD. So, the amount of money he spent on the headphones is (48 - 4). 

The cost of the headphones is (48 - 4) = $44. 

Now, we can find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphones. 

The number of CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphones is 44 / 4 = 11.

Since Tom bought 1 CD, the number of CDs he could have bought with the money he spent on the headphones is 11 - 1 = 10.

"To find the number of passengers after the second stop, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get in.
Now, the total number of passengers is:
40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 3 times fewer means 3 times the number of people who got off minus the number of people who got off, we need to find 3 times 21 (the number of people who got off) first:
3 * 21 = 63

Now, subtract 21 from this result to find the number of people who got on:
63 - 21 = 42

Now, add the number of passengers who got on to the number of passengers left after the second stop:
59 (left) + 42 (got in) = 101

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.
   Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years.
   So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.
3. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.
4. The difference in their current ages is 47 - 22 = 25 years.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
2. The computer costs $1,100.
3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer.

First, let's find the cost of the printer. Since the printer costs $400 less than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer:
Printer cost = Computer cost - $400
Printer cost = $1,100 - $400
Printer cost = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer, which is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. To find the cost of the two monitors, we subtract this amount from the total cost:
Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - Cost of computer and printer
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,800
Cost of 2 monitors = $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we need to find the cost of one monitor. To do this, we divide the cost of 2 monitors by 2:
Cost of 1 monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
Cost of 1 monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of 1 monitor = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we first need to determine the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Since there are 10 boys (half of 20 kids) and each boy brought 60 shells, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 600 seashells. 

First, we calculate 4 * 600, which is 2400. Then we add 600 to that, which is 3000. 

Since there are 10 girls (half of 20 kids), we need to divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by 10 to find out how many seashells each girl brought. 

3000 / 10 = 300.

The final answer is: 300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Nick had twice as many candies as George. Let's say George had x candies. Then, Nick had 2x candies.
2. George ate 5 candies, so now George has x - 5 candies left.
3. We are given that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 3
4. To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation: x = 3 + 5
5. x = 8, so George had 8 candies initially.
6. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2x = 2(8) = 16 candies.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Anne's age, we need to first find Alyana's age, and then add 2 years to it.

Chenny is 10 years old, and Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny. So, Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6 years.

Now, Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so Anne's age is 6 + 2 = 8 years.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188

The final answer is: 188"
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made and subtract that from the target of 72.

Emma made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

Total vlogs made = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Since Emma's target is 72 vlogs, we subtract the total vlogs made from the target:

72 - 54 = 18

Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her target of 72 vlogs per month.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total amount you paid, first, calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill. 

20% of $50 is calculated as 0.20 * $50 = $10.

Now, add the tip to the original bill: $50 + $10 = $60.

Since your wife wants to split the check evenly, you will pay half of the total amount: $60 / 2 = $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The eldest boy's initial share is $18 / 3 = $6.
2. He added $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11.
3. He added another $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.
4. He spent $8, so he now has $21 - $8 = $13.
5. He tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8, so he now has $13 * 3 = $39.

The final answer is: $39"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's assume the number of days in the first half of April is x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half will also be x.

2. Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. Let's denote the amount he saves in the first half as y. Then, the amount he saves in the second half will be 2y.

3. The total amount Elvis wants to save in April is $1125. Since he saves y in the first half and 2y in the second half, we can set up the equation: xy + 2y(x) = 1125

4. Simplifying the equation, we get: xy + 2xy = 1125
   Combining like terms, we get: 3xy = 1125

5. Since Elvis wants to save $1125 in total, and he has 30 days in April, we can set up the equation: 3xy = 1125
   We know that x + x = 30 (since the first and second half of the month have the same number of days), so x = 15.

6. Substituting x = 15 into the equation 3xy = 1125, we get: 3(15)y = 1125
   Simplifying the equation, we get: 45y = 1125

7. To find the value of y, we divide both sides of the equation by 45: y = 1125 / 45
   y = 25

8. Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, the amount he saves in the second half is 2y = 2(25) = 50

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the total cost of the fruits, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of 3 apples at $1.50 each is 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of 5 oranges at $0.80 each is 5 x $0.80 = $4.
The cost of 6 peaches at $0.75 each is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them will get for completing 20 tasks.

Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, so for 20 tasks, he will get 20 * $0.8 = $16.

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, so for 20 tasks, she will get 20 * $0.5 = $10.

Now, we need to find the difference between what Jairus and Jenny get. The difference is $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as x. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, the amount of money Jeff gets is 4x.

The total amount of money they are dividing is $100. So, the sum of the money Jeff and Brad get is x + 4x = 5x.

Since the total amount is $100, we can set up the equation: 5x = 100.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 5: x = 100 / 5 = 20.

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

The final answer is: $80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the total miles he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 = 6 miles.

Now, we multiply the daily miles by the number of days he works in a week: 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice: 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters
2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once: 26 / 2 = 13 letters
3. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written: 52 + 13 = 65 letters

Now, she re-writes the 65 letters she has already written: 65 + 65 = 130 letters

The total number of letters Elise has written is 130."
"This problem can be solved using the concept of exponential growth. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families being notified. 

In the third round, each of the 9 families (from the second round) calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families being notified. 

In the fourth round, each of the 27 families (from the third round) calls 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families being notified.

The total number of families notified in the fourth round is 81."
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and then add that to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight he lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Since Mark's final weight is 70 pounds, we can find his initial weight by adding the weight he lost to his final weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first determine the total number of toys in the larger play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys and the larger play set is five times larger, we can calculate the total number of toys in the larger play set as follows:

Total toys in larger play set = 5 * 80 = 400

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys to have enough to make a play set five times larger than James's, we can set up an equation to represent this situation:

Let x be the number of toys Jonathan currently has. Then, x + 2 = 400.

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys. 

The final answer is: 398"
"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

Cost of 5 notebooks: 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
Cost of 2 pens: 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
Cost of 1 calculator: $12
Cost of 1 geometry set: $10
Total cost before discount: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

Now, we need to apply the 10% discount to the total cost. 
Discount amount: 10% of $30 = 0.1 * $30 = $3
Total cost after discount: $30 - $3 = $27

The final answer is: $27"
"To find the total cost of the items, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the sales above $1000.

For the first $1000, she earns a 30% commission:
Commission on the first $1000 = 30% of $1000 = 0.3 * $1000 = $300

For the sales above $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, she earns an additional 10% commission:
Commission on the sales above $1000 = 10% of $1500 = 0.1 * $1500 = $150

Total commission earned by Antonella = Commission on the first $1000 + Commission on the sales above $1000
= $300 + $150
= $450

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. Since it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that gives us 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now that we know it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water, we can find out how long it takes him to swim 3 miles in warm water. 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold water. Since it takes him 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

Now that we know it takes Ray 102 minutes to swim 3 miles in warm water and 48 minutes to swim 3 miles in cold water, we can find the difference. 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To find out how many cups Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake, we first need to determine how many cups he currently drinks. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, and Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, we need to know the daily recommended amount of coffee.

Let's assume the daily recommended amount of coffee is x cups. Since Octavia drinks half of this amount, she drinks x/2 cups. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

We are given that the daily recommended amount of coffee is 4 cups. Therefore, x = 4.

Now, we can find out how many cups Juan currently drinks: 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups.

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to 4 cups, we need to find the difference between the amount he currently drinks and the recommended amount: 20 - 4 = 16 cups.

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups."
"To find the total number of rodents, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

The pet shop has 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is 3 * 10 = 30.

The pet shop has 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents: 30 + 15 = 45.

"To find the average weight of the 3 friends, we need to first find their individual weights. 

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. 
Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so Susan's weight = 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, so Bob's weight = 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we need to find the average weight of the 3 friends. 
Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3 
= (150 + 130 + 260) / 3 
= 540 / 3

Initial angle of the pyramid = 32 degrees
Angle the sun moves per hour = 5 degrees
Number of hours the sun moves = 10 hours

Final angle = Initial angle + (Angle the sun moves per hour * Number of hours)
Final angle = 32 + (5 * 10)

"To find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of candles he needs. Since one son is 12 and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Typically, birthday candles are one per year of age, so James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed by the number of candles per pack: 20 / 5 = 4.

Since James needs 4 packs of candles and each pack costs $3, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 4 * 3 = 12.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week and then convert that to pages. 

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Given that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes by first finding out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. 

To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which equals 70. So, she read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes for 70 intervals. 

Now, we multiply the number of intervals (70) by the number of pages she can read in each interval (2), which equals 140 pages. 

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. 

So, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the age of Shiloh's nephew be x.

In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

In 7 years, his nephew will be x + 7 years old.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can set up the equation:

51 = 3(x + 7)

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 3:

51 / 3 = x + 7
17 = x + 7

Next, we'll subtract 7 from both sides of the equation to solve for x:

17 - 7 = x
10 = x

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of action figures he bought each day and then add them up.

From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day on wooden action figures. Since he has 4 days, he spent a total of 4 * $5 = $20 on wooden action figures.

He has $70 initially and spent $20 on wooden action figures, so he has $70 - $20 = $50 left. 

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. Since he has $50 left and 3 days, he can spend a maximum of $50 / $2 = 25 action figures.

However, we need to consider that he has $50 left, so he can only buy 25 action figures with the money he has, not the money he will have after buying the action figures. 

So, he will buy 25 action figures on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.

Now, let's add up the total number of action figures he bought: 
- 4 wooden action figures from Sunday to Wednesday
- 25 plastic action figures from Thursday to Saturday

Total action figures = 4 + 25 = 29

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 - 160 = 100.

"To find out how much money will be remaining in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount of money she will remove from the account in 2 years and subtract it from the initial amount.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 x 12 = 24 months.

Katina removes $100 from the account every month, so in 24 months, she will remove 24 x $100 = $2400.

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her account.

"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. So, the cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30 per sandwich.

The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00. So, the cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00 per sandwich.

The total cost per sandwich is the sum of the cost of bread and cheese/condiments, which is $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30 per sandwich.

The revenue per sandwich is $7.00.

The net profit per sandwich is the revenue per sandwich minus the total cost per sandwich, which is $7.00 - $3.30 = $3.70 per sandwich.

Since they sell 10 sandwiches, the total revenue is 10 * $7.00 = $70.00, and the total cost is 10 * $3.30 = $33.00.

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

The final answer is: $37.00"

The cost of the new carpet is 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is 216 square feet * $4 per square foot = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost is $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11332.

The final answer is: $11332."
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and divide it by the number of days.

Total number of birds = 50 (days 1 and 2) + 0 (day 3) + 120 (days 4 and 5) + 20 (day 6) + 90 (day 7)
Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90
Total number of birds = 280

Number of days = 7

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / Number of days
Average number of birds per day = 280 / 7
Average number of birds per day = 40

"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18.

The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4% for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% higher than 520 degrees.

To do this, we can calculate 4% of 520 and add it to 520.

4% of 520 is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.

The temperature Maggie should set her oven to is 520 + 20.8 = 540.8.

The final answer is: 540.8"
"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time as follows:
1 hour = 60 minutes
Adding the 30 minutes, we get:
60 + 30 = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the time as follows:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
Adding the 5 minutes, we get:
120 + 5 = 125 minutes

Now, we add the time of both movies together:
90 + 125 = 215 minutes

The total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes.

The final answer is: 215"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price. 

Herb's house price = $76,000
30% of Herb's house price = 0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800
Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
= $76,000 - $22,800
= $53,200

Now, we need to find the combined value of the two houses.
Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
= $76,000 + $53,200

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.
2. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.
3. Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by Judy and her friend:

Judy's total: 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36
Friend's total: 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two is 36 + 84 = 120.

"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we need to first find the total number of pairs of contacts Pete will buy and the total cost of the boxes.

Since each box lasts 45 days and Pete buys 2 boxes, the total number of days the contacts will last is 2 * 45 = 90 days.

Since 90 single-use contacts will last 90 days, the number of pairs of contacts Pete will buy is 90 / 2 = 45 pairs.

The discount on each box is 10% of $100, which is 0.1 * $100 = $10. So, the discounted price of each box is $100 - $10 = $90.

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is 2 * $90 = $180.

To find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs: $180 / 45 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings and then find the difference.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many calories Hannah burns in total, we need to calculate the calories burned during aerobics and running. 

Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to find out how many sets of 200 calories are in 1600 calories. 

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8

Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water.

The final answer is: 800"
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. 

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans)
2. G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans)
3. B + R + G = 4500 (total number of jelly beans)

Substituting the first two equations into the third equation, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3.00B = 4500
Divide both sides by 3:
B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

To find the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

"To find the total number of people attending, we need to break down the information given.

Initially, Alex invites 100 people via email. Each of these 100 people will invite 2 friends, so the total number of people invited by them is 100 * 2 = 200.

Then, Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them say they will bring their spouses. This means 8 couples will be attending, which is 8 * 2 = 16 people.

Now, we add the people invited via email (including their friends), the people invited by phone (including their spouses), and Alex herself. 

Total number of people = 100 (initially invited) + 200 (friends of the initially invited) + 16 (spouses of the friends invited by phone) + 10 (Alex's friends invited by phone) + 1 (Alex herself) = 327

However, we need to consider that Alex is also attending, so we should not count her as an additional person. 

Total number of people = 327 - 1 = 326

"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to find the weight of the Papillon first, then multiply it by 44.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

"To find the total cost of the boots on Amazon, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. 

Amazon cost = $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20

On eBay, the shipping cost is twice as much as on Amazon, so the shipping cost is $4 * 2 = $8.

eBay cost = $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping) = $21

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to subtract the Amazon cost from the eBay cost.

Difference = eBay cost - Amazon cost = $21 - $20 = $1

The boots work out to be $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to reach or exceed 20 feet. 

Since the beanstalk doubles in height every day and starts at 4 feet, we can calculate its height for each day as follows:

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

As we can see, on the 4th day, the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet off the ground.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 

Protein percentage = (3 grams / 100 grams) * 100 = 3%

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we can multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage:

Protein per day = 200 grams * 3% = 200 * 0.03 = 6 grams

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the protein per day by 7 to find out how many grams of protein John gets per week:

Protein per week = 6 grams * 7 = 42 grams

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Jerry's current age be x.

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can write an equation based on this information:

x = 2(x - 5)

To solve for x, we can expand the equation:

x = 2x - 10

Now, let's isolate x by moving the 2x term to the left side of the equation:

x - 2x = -10

Combine like terms:

-x = -10

Multiply both sides by -1 to solve for x:

x = 10

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown, and then subtract the deposit he has already paid.

The base price of each implant is $2000. Since George needs 2 implants, the total cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000.

For one of the implants, George wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already paid a deposit of $600. To find out how much he still needs to pay, we subtract the deposit from the total cost: $4500 - $600 = $3900.

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to pay for the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it can be represented as 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, it can be represented as 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. 
One angle is twice the smallest angle: 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees.
One angle is three times the smallest angle: 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the quarters to cents: 8 quarters * 25 cents/quarter = 200 cents
Next, let's convert the dimes to cents: 6 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 60 cents
Then, let's convert the nickels to cents: 14 nickels * 5 cents/nickel = 70 cents
Lastly, let's convert the pennies to cents: 15 pennies * 1 cent/penny = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has: 200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many Colby can buy: 345 cents / 5 cents/gumball = 69 gumballs

"To find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to first find out how many pounds Ruiz makes in an hour. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how many pounds he makes in an hour, we divide 120 by 2. 

120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour for Ruiz.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour. To find out how many pounds Marissa makes in an hour, we multiply 60 by 3/4.

60 * (3/4) = 45 pounds per hour for Marissa.

Now that we know how many pounds each person makes in an hour, we can find out how many pounds they make in 12 hours. 

Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.

Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

To find the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together, we add the pounds made by Ruiz and Marissa. 

720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

In the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
Total cups sold in the first four hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups
Total revenue in the first four hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

In the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
Total cups sold in the next two hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups
Total revenue in the next two hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

"To find out how many times the tires rotate in a month, we need to multiply the number of miles driven per month by the number of rotations per mile. 

Rotations per month = 400 miles/month * 725 rotations/mile = 290,000 rotations/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we need to multiply the rotations per month by 12 to get the total rotations per year.

Rotations per year = 290,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 3,480,000 rotations/year

Now, we need to divide the total number of rotations a tire can undergo by the number of rotations per year to find out how many years the tire will last.

"To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3). The discount amount is $60 * 0.3 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost of the items. $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to calculate it separately. We can subtract the final cost from the initial amount of money Joe has. $50 - $42 = $8.

"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of croissants he wants to make is:
4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, the total number of croissants is:
28 dozen * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we know it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how much butter is needed for 336 croissants, we need to multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen:
336 croissants * (1/4 pound/croissant) = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of his street. 

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Cost to repave Lewis' street = Cost per meter * Length of Lewis' street
Cost to repave Lewis' street = $194 * 490
Cost to repave Lewis' street = $95,060

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we need to first find the cost to repave Monica's street and then subtract it from the cost to repave Lewis' street.

Gary does laundry twice a week, so he does laundry 52 times a year (since there are 52 weeks in a year). Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used in a year is:

52 weeks/year * 2 loads/week * 20 gallons/load = 2080 gallons/year

Now, we multiply the total amount of water used in a year by the cost of a gallon of water:

2080 gallons/year * $0.15/gallon = $312/year

The final answer is: $312"
"To find the total amount Scarlett spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them up.

1. The aquarium cost $10.00.
2. Two bags of rocks cost 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.
3. Three pieces of coral cost 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.
4. Twenty fish cost 20 * $0.50 = $10.00.
5. The fish food cost $2.00.

Now, let's add up the costs: 
$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

"To find the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we need to calculate its height at the end of each week and add the growth from each week.

At the end of the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

At the end of the second week, it doubled in height, so it became 3 * 2 = 6 inches tall.

At the end of the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it became 6 + 4 = 10 inches tall.

Therefore, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks.

"To find the number of students, we first need to find the total number of seats in the auditorium. 

Total number of seats = Number of rows * Number of seats per row
Total number of seats = 4 * 18
Total number of seats = 72

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. 
Number of seats occupied by administrators = Total number of seats * (1/4)
Number of seats occupied by administrators = 72 * (1/4)
Number of seats occupied by administrators = 18

Now, we need to find the number of remaining seats after the administrators occupied their seats. 
Remaining seats = Total number of seats - Number of seats occupied by administrators
Remaining seats = 72 - 18
Remaining seats = 54

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. 
Number of seats occupied by parents = Remaining seats * (1/3)
Number of seats occupied by parents = 54 * (1/3)
Number of seats occupied by parents = 18

Now, we need to find the number of seats occupied by the students. 
Number of seats occupied by students = Remaining seats - Number of seats occupied by parents
Number of seats occupied by students = 54 - 18
Number of seats occupied by students = 36

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we first need to find the total number of street lights at all intersections. 

Each intersection has 6 poles, and each pole has 4 street lights. So, the total number of street lights at each intersection is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

However, 20 street lights are not working. To find the total number of functioning street lights, we subtract the non-working lights from the total number of lights: 96 - 20 = 76.

"To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to add the number of times each DVD has already been played to the number of times each can be played before breaking, and then add those two totals together.

DVD 1 has been played 356 times and can be played 1000 times before breaking, so it can be played 1000 - 356 = 644 more times.

DVD 2 has been played 135 times and can be played 1000 times before breaking, so it can be played 1000 - 135 = 865 more times.

Now, we add the number of times each DVD can be played before breaking to the number of times each has already been played: 356 + 644 + 135 + 865 = 2000.

The final answer is: 2000"

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim chews during school, we need to calculate how many 2-hour intervals are in an 8-hour school day. 

8 hours / 2 hours per interval = 4 intervals

Since Jim chews 1 piece of gum per 2-hour interval, he chews 4 pieces of gum during school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so in total, he chews 4 (during school) + 1 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 6 pieces of gum.

Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

When he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

So, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find Charmaine's age 4 years from now, we need to first find her current age. Since she will be 16 in 12 years, we subtract 12 from 16 to find her current age.

"To find the total number of flowers that have bloomed, we need to first find the total number of flowers in the garden. 

There are 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row. So, the total number of flowers is 10 * 20 = 200.

Since only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we need to multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5.

To do this, we can multiply 200 by 4 and then divide by 5.

200 * 4 = 800
800 / 5 = 160

So, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s. 

1 Mb = 1000 kb, so 1 kb = 1/1000 Mb. 

Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kb/s. To convert it to Mb/s, we multiply 20 by 1/1000. 

20 kb/s * (1/1000) = 0.02 Mb/s

"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately and then add them together.

The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days, so the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
10 * 3 = 30

For the remaining days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than the first three days, so it pulled 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. There are 4 remaining days in the week (7 - 3 = 4), so the total number of cars towed in the remaining days is:
6 * 4 = 24

Now, we add the total number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining days:
30 + 24 = 54

The final answer is: 54"
"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height (4 feet) and Adam's current height (40 inches), and then divide that by his growth rate (2 inches per year).

First, let's convert the required height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the required height and Adam's current height: 48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can divide the difference by his growth rate to find out how many years it will take for him to reach the required height: 8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars, then apply his commission.

First, let's find the total cost of the cars: 
10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000

The company paid 30% of the cost to acquire the cars, so the amount they paid is:
$250,000 * 0.3 = $75,000

The profit from selling the cars is the selling price minus the cost:
$250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

James got a 10% commission on the profit:
$175,000 * 0.1 = $17,500

So, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of men who can stay upright, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Given that 25% of the riders can stay upright, and there are 100 riders, we can calculate the number of riders who can stay upright as follows:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25

Now, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women, we can calculate:

60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15

Since the remaining riders are men, we can find the number of men by subtracting the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to find the price of the gold and silver jewels first.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

Given that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to determine the number of truck and rose stamps he bought, and then add them to the 16 snowflake stamps.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. 
He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.
He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, we add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps to find the total number of stamps Max bought: 
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to first determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch by subtracting 6 from Naomi's catch.

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught. Since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, we can calculate Tommy's catch by adding 3 to Darren's catch.

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as 'x'. Since there are 10 total classes, the number of classes he will attend is 10 - x.

The total cost of the classes is $60. If each class costs $10, then the total cost of the classes he attends is 10(10 - x).

The cost of the classes he misses is x * 0 (since he doesn't pay for the classes he misses).

The total cost of the classes he attends and misses is equal to the total cost of the classes, so we can set up the equation:

10(10 - x) = 60

Expanding the equation, we get:

100 - 10x = 60

Subtracting 100 from both sides, we get:

-10x = -40

Dividing both sides by -10, we get:

x = 4

So, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total weekly production for the two, we first need to determine how many customers each of them can process in a week. 

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jewel's weekly production is 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie's daily production is 2 * 50 = 100 customers. Therefore, Julie's weekly production is 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for the two is the sum of their individual weekly productions: 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Paisley ran 4 miles.
2. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.
3. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so we can set up an equation to represent this relationship: Reggie's distance = Lynn's distance + 3.
4. Since we know Reggie ran 20 miles, we can substitute this value into the equation: 20 = Lynn's distance + 3.
5. To find Lynn's distance, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides: Lynn's distance = 20 - 3.
6. Lynn's distance = 17 miles.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to first find the cost of one apple and one orange. 

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30. 

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges by multiplying the cost of one apple by 5 and the cost of one orange by 5, then adding the two amounts together.

The cost of 5 apples is $1.30 * 5 = $6.50.
The cost of 5 oranges is $1.10 * 5 = $5.50.

The total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

"To find the total amount Tim will make in a year, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his monthly salary:
5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Next, let's calculate the bonus:
Bonus = half a month's salary = $20,000 / 2 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly income:
Total monthly income = new monthly salary + bonus = $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Fishio received 2000 likes initially.
2. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. 
   So, the number of likes after 3 weeks = 70 * 2000 = 140000.
3. The total number of likes after 3 weeks is the sum of the initial likes and the new likes received in 3 weeks.
   However, we are not given the number of likes received in 3 weeks, but we are given that she received 20000 more new likes recently.
   This implies that the 20000 new likes were received after the 3 weeks, not during the 3 weeks.
4. So, the total number of likes after 3 weeks = 140000.
5. Now, we add the 20000 new likes to the total number of likes after 3 weeks.

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then subtract the two costs.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got a $2 discount. So, the total cost is:
20 * $20 = $400
Discount: $2
Total cost = $400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, and a 10% discount was offered on the total cost. So, the total cost is:
20 * $30 = $600
Discount: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Total cost = $600 - $60 = $540

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first month, Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Let's call the total sales from green hats in the first month ""x"". Then, the sales from red hats in the first month is $400, which is half of x, so we can write the equation:

x / 2 = 400

To find x, we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 400 * 2
x = 800

So, the total sales from green hats in the first month is $800.

2. The total sales in the first month is the sum of sales from red and green hats:

Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
= $400 + $800
= $1200

3. In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. Let's find the sales in the second month:

Sales in the second month = 3/4 * Total sales in the first month
= 3/4 * $1200
= $900

4. To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales of the first and second months:

Total sales in two months = Sales in the first month + Sales in the second month
= $1200 + $900
= $2100

Total deviled egg halves needed: 48

Now, we need to divide the total deviled egg halves needed by 2 to find out how many whole eggs she needs. 

Total deviled egg halves needed: 48
Eggs per 2 deviled egg halves: 1
Total eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs.

Total eggs needed: 24
Eggs per dozen: 12
Dozens of eggs needed: 24 / 12 = 2

"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages read per day = 10

Days to finish the book = Total pages / Pages read per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we need to subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the total number of days.

Days before the deadline = Total days - Days to finish the book

"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the cost of renting the hanger, and the cost of fuel.

The cost of the plane itself is $150,000.

The cost of renting the hanger is $5000 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost of renting the hanger for the first year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The cost of fuel is twice as much as the cost of renting the hanger, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total cost of fuel for the first year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

The total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year is the sum of the cost of the plane, the cost of renting the hanger, and the cost of fuel: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so it took her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork.
3. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 40 minutes.

Now, let's add up the cooking times for all the food: 
- Rice: 30 minutes
- Pork: 50 minutes
- Beans: 40 minutes

Total cooking time = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes

"To find the cost of each mixture, we need to calculate the cost of almonds and walnuts separately and then combine them.

For the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- Cost of almonds: 1/2 pound * $10/pound = $5
- Cost of walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
- Total cost of the first mixture: $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- Cost of almonds: 1/5 pound * $10/pound = $2
- Cost of walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
- Total cost of the second mixture: $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
Difference = Cost of the first mixture - Cost of the second mixture
Difference = $10 - $7
Difference = $3

The final answer is: $3"
"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can set up the following equation based on the total number of legs:

4S + 2G = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, which means the sum of the number of sheep and geese is 20:

S + G = 20

We can solve the second equation for G:

G = 20 - S

Now, substitute G in the first equation:

4S + 2(20 - S) = 70

Expand the equation:

4S + 40 - 2S = 70

Combine like terms:

2S + 40 = 70

Subtract 40 from both sides:

2S = 30

Divide both sides by 2:

S = 15

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut. 

First, let's find the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he needs 7 pounds for a week (1 pound * 7 days). 

The cost of the more expensive coffee is $6 * 7 = $42. 
The cost of the donut is $2.

The total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

"To find the number of math teachers, we first need to find the number of history teachers and then subtract that from the total number of teachers. 

60% of 150 teachers are history teachers. To find 60% of 150, we multiply 150 by 0.6. 

150 * 0.6 = 90

So, there are 90 history teachers. To find the number of math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers.

150 - 90 = 60

There are 60 math teachers. 

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours they sleep per day.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Kassidy and Rayna have. 

First, we know that Aurelia has $120. 

Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
Kassidy's money = (3/4) * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = (3/4) * 120
Kassidy's money = 90

Now, we know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. 
Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + 60
Rayna's money = 90 + 60
Rayna's money = 150

Now, we have the money of all three: Aurelia ($120), Kassidy ($90), and Rayna ($150). 

To find out how much they would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them, we need to add their money and divide by 3.
Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = 120 + 90 + 150
Total money = 360

Now, let's divide the total money by 3 to find out how much each would have:
Money per person = Total money / 3
Money per person = 360 / 3
Money per person = 120

Janey's books = 2x + 3

We are given that Janey has 21 books. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 18 / 2

"To find the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we need to find the difference between the target height and the current height:

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. 
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs 8 more toys.
   Total toys needed so far: 4 (initial toys) + 8 (additional toys) = 12 toys
3. When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Since there were 8 dogs initially, there are now 8 * 2 = 16 more dogs.
   Total dogs now: 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (initial additional dogs) + 16 (new dogs) = 28 dogs
   Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 28 toys.
   Total toys needed so far: 12 (previous toys) + 28 (new toys) = 40 toys
4. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys.
   Total toys needed: 40 (previous toys) - 3 (unnecessary toys) = 37 toys

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a ratio of potatoes to hash browns as follows: 

6 potatoes : 36 hash browns

To find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we can set up a proportion:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

6x = 96 * 36

6x = 3456

Now, we can divide both sides by 6 to find x:

x = 3456 / 6

x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to consider the two changes made to the dress: the 50% extension and the 20cm addition.

Let's denote the original length of the dress as 'x'. 

The 50% extension means the dress is now 150% of its original length, which can be expressed as 1.5x.

Adding 20cm to the bottom of the dress means the new length is 1.5x + 20.

We are given that the final design is 140cm long, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 140 - 20
1.5x = 120

Next, divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 120 / 1.5
x = 80

The original length of the dress was 80cm."

"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. 

Since there are two twins and one triplet, the total age is 2T + t = 44. 

We also know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so T = t + 7.

Substituting T = t + 7 into the first equation, we get 2(t + 7) + t = 44.

Expanding the equation, we get 2t + 14 + t = 44.

Combining like terms, we get 3t + 14 = 44.

Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get 3t = 30.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get t = 10.

"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, but we don't know the total bill yet. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total points collected by Adam, Betty, Martha, and Tom, and then subtract that from the minimum threshold of 400 points.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more than Adam. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.3: 50 * 0.3 = 15. Then, we add this to Adam's points: 50 + 15 = 65 points for Betty.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. To find 3 times Tom's points, we multiply 35 by 3: 35 * 3 = 105 points for Martha.

Now, we add up the points collected by Adam, Betty, Martha, and Tom: 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold: 400 - 255 = 145 points.

"Let's break down the information given:

- There are 8 males and 6 females, making a total of 14 people.
- Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female.
- Each female ate 3 dumplings.

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

The total number of dumplings eaten by the females is 6 * 3 = 18.
The total number of dumplings eaten by the males is 8 * 4 = 32.

The total number of dumplings eaten by all the people is 18 + 32 = 50.

"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to first find out how much they need to raise per hour. 

The amount raised after the first 3 hours is $2100. To find the amount raised per hour, we divide the amount raised by the number of hours: $2100 / 3 = $700 per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise the remaining amount. The total goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. The remaining amount is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

To find the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour: $4200 / $700 = 6 hours.

Since they have already raised money for 3 hours, we need to add the additional hours to the initial 3 hours: 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each type of ice cream and then add them together.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find the production rate per hour, we divide 100 quarts by 2 hours:

100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour (chocolate)

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find the production rate per hour, we divide 50 quarts by 4 hours:

50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour (vanilla)

Now, we need to find the total production rate per hour for both types of ice cream:

50 quarts per hour (chocolate) + 12.5 quarts per hour (vanilla) = 62.5 quarts per hour

To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we multiply the total production rate per hour by 48:

62.5 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 3000 quarts

This means Erin can buy 4 scoops of ice cream. However, the deal is buy 2 scoops get 1 free, so Erin can get 3 scoops for the price of 2. 

To take advantage of the deal, Erin should buy 2 scoops and get 1 free, which is a total of 3 scoops."
"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of candies they eat in two weeks and subtract that from their initial amount.

There are 7 days in a week, so two weeks is 14 days. 

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces of candy and eats 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces of candy and eats 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

"To find the total number of tiles needed, we first need to find the area of two-thirds of the bathroom. 

The area of the entire bathroom is 36 sq ft. To find two-thirds of this area, we multiply 36 by 2/3.

36 * (2/3) = 36 * 2 / 3 = 72 / 3 = 24

So, two-thirds of the bathroom is 24 sq ft. 

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, we multiply the area of two-thirds of the bathroom by 24.

24 * 24 = 576

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

576"
"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store and compare it to the cost of picking them.

The cost of picking blueberries is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds (amount picked) = $20 + $45 = $65.

The cost of buying the blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $75.

The difference in cost is $75 (store price) - $65 (picking price) = $10.

"To find the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends, we first need to find the total number of slices they ate. Since there are 5 people in total, and 2 of them ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

2/3 * 5 pizzas * 12 slices per pizza = 2/3 * 60 = 40 slices

However, since Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we need to consider that each of them ate 2/3 of 1 pizza, not 2/3 of 5 pizzas. So, the correct calculation is:

2/3 * 1 pizza * 12 slices per pizza = 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices per person. Since there are 3 people, the total number of slices they ate is:

8 slices per person * 3 people = 24 slices

Now, let's find the total number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends. They ate Â¾ of their pizzas, which is:

3/4 * 2 pizzas * 12 slices per pizza = 3/4 * 24 = 18 slices

Now, let's add the total number of slices eaten by both groups:

24 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (two remaining friends) = 42 slices

Since there were 5 pizzas in total, with 12 slices per pizza, the total number of slices is:

5 pizzas * 12 slices per pizza = 60 slices

Now, let's subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:

60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, we get 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. We can write the equation as:

100 = 9x + 10

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

90 = 9x

Now, we divide both sides by 9 to find the value of 'x':

x = 90 / 9
x = 10

"To find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows smashed from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each. A quarter of the students' cars' windows are smashed, which is 1/4 * 64 = 16 cars. Since each car has 4 windows, the total number of windows smashed from students' cars is 16 * 4 = 64.

Next, let's find the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each. Three-fourths of the teachers' cars' windows are smashed, which is 3/4 * 32 = 24 cars. Since each car has 2 windows, the total number of windows smashed from teachers' cars is 24 * 2 = 48.

Now, let's add the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars to find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah. 
Total windows smashed = 64 (from students' cars) + 48 (from teachers' cars) = 112

"To find out how many boxes of graham crackers are needed, we first need to determine the total number of s'mores required. 

9 kids want 2 s'mores each, so the total number of s'mores for kids is 9 * 2 = 18. 
6 adults will eat 1 s'more each, so the total number of s'mores for adults is 6 * 1 = 6. 
The total number of s'mores needed is 18 + 6 = 24.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 s'mores, we need to divide the total number of s'mores by 8 to find out how many sleeves are needed. 
24 s'mores / 8 s'mores per sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the total number of sleeves needed by 3 to find out how many boxes are required. 
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

Therefore, they will need 1 box of graham crackers.

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first find their individual ages.

Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can start by finding her father's age. It is mentioned that Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 

Let's denote Dora's father's age as F and Dora's age as D. We can write the equation as F = 2D + 8. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can substitute D = 15 into the equation to find F.

F = 2(15) + 8
F = 30 + 8
F = 38

Now that we know Dora's father is 38 years old, we can find her mother's age. It is mentioned that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 

Let's denote Dora's mother's age as M. We can write the equation as M = F - 4. Since F = 38, we can substitute F into the equation to find M.

M = 38 - 4
M = 34

Now that we know Dora's age (15), her father's age (38), and her mother's age (34), we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.

Total combined age = D + F + M
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34

"To find out how many apples Beck has initially, we need to subtract 23 from Boris's total of 100 apples. 

Beck's initial apples = 100 - 23 = 77 apples

After Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck now has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

Boris still has 100 - 10 = 90 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's total from Boris's total.

Difference = 90 - 87 = 3

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the total amount of water available (32 ounces).

For giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces/cube = 12 ounces
For medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces
For small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 4 ounces

Total water used = 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Now, subtract the total water used from the total amount of water available:
32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces

"To find the cost of a half-gallon jar, we need to subtract $2 from the cost of a gallon jar. 

Cost of a gallon jar = $5
Cost of a half-gallon jar = Cost of a gallon jar - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Now, we need to find the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5
Cost of 10-gallon jars = $50

Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $48

Total cost = Cost of 10-gallon jars + Cost of 16 half-gallon jars
Total cost = $50 + $48
Total cost = $98

"Let's break down the information given:

- Total students = 50
- Students who like to bake = 10
- Students who like to play basketball = 5
- Students who like to play music = 2 * (students who like to play basketball) = 2 * 5 = 10

Now, let's find the total number of students who like to either play video games or play music. Since we know the number of students who like to bake, basketball, and music, we can subtract these from the total number of students to find the number of students who like to play video games.

Students who like to play video games or music = Total students - (students who like to bake + students who like to play basketball + students who like to play music)
= 50 - (10 + 5 + 10)
= 50 - 25
= 25

However, this is the total number of students who like to play video games or music. To find the number of students who like to play video games, we need to subtract the number of students who like to play music from this total.

Students who like to play video games = Students who like to play video games or music - students who like to play music

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume the number of students in each class is x. Since there are two classes, the total number of students is 2x. We are given that the total number of students is 80, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 80

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 80 / 2
x = 40

So, there are 40 students in each class.

Now, we are given that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we can multiply the total number of students in each class by 0.4 (which is the decimal equivalent of 40%):

Number of girls in each class = 0.4 * 40
= 16

Since the total number of students in each class is 40, the number of boys in each class can be found by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students:

Number of boys in each class = 40 - 16
= 24

The final answer is: 24"

"To find out how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, we need to first calculate the daily savings and then multiply it by 7.

The vendor used to buy 500 tomatoes a day at $.5 each, so his daily cost was 500 * $.5 = $250.

With the new vendor, he buys the same 500 tomatoes at $.4 each, so his new daily cost is 500 * $.4 = $200.

The daily savings is the difference between the old cost and the new cost: $250 - $200 = $50.

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7: $50 * 7 = $350.

The final answer is: $350"

"To find out how many groups are needed, we first need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups required for the activity. 

However, the question states that the activity requires 12 groups, but the students are to be separated into six groups of equal size. This seems to be a contradiction, as the activity requires 12 groups but the students are to be divided into six groups. 

Assuming the question is asking for the number of groups needed to divide the students into six groups of equal size, we can proceed with the calculation.

Number of students = 54
Number of groups = 6

Number of students per group = 54 / 6 = 9

Since the activity requires 12 groups, we need to find out how many groups are needed to divide the students into six groups of equal size. 

Number of groups needed = 54 / 9 = 6

However, the question asks for the number of more groups needed to form, which implies that we need to find the difference between the required groups and the actual groups. 

Since the actual groups are 6 and the required groups are 12, we need to find the difference.

Number of more groups needed = 12 - 6 = 6"

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

1. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
   90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading small stickers.

2. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
   50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   Since each large sticker is worth one large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.

3. She trades the rest of her large stickers (40 - 20 = 20) for small buttons. 
   Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has:
- Small buttons: 27 (from small stickers) + 60 (from large stickers) = 87 small buttons
- Large buttons: 20

Total buttons = 87 (small buttons) + 20 (large buttons) = 107 buttons

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2x, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2:

2. The first house needs 1/2 of what the second house needs.
3. The third house needs double what the first house needs.

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as x. Then, the first house needs x/2 cases, and the third house needs 2*(x/2) = x cases.

Since the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250, we can set up the equation:

x + (x/2) + x = 250

To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms:

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at 75 mph. To find the time it takes to drive to the museum, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since he drives back, the total time spent driving is 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours.

Adding the time spent at the museum (6 hours), the total time Jack is gone from home is:

600 * (1/3) = 200 movies in series

Since Mike can buy the series for $6, the cost of the series is $6.

Next, let's find the number of remaining movies. We subtract the movies in series from the total number of movies:
600 - 200 = 400 remaining movies

Now, let's find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we multiply 400 by 0.4:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

The cost of the older movies is $5 each, so the total cost of the older movies is:
160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are not in series and are not older movies, so they are normal movies. There are 400 - 160 = 240 normal movies.

The cost of the normal movies is $10 each, so the total cost of the normal movies is:
240 * $10 = $2400

Now, we add the cost of the series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies to find the total cost:
$6 + $800 + $2400 = $3106

The final answer is: $3106"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of peaches is 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
The cost of plums is 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, we add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To find the distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked, then add them together.

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance driven. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance driven is 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance hiked is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Now, we add the distance driven and the distance hiked to find the total distance to the vacation spot. Total distance = 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: 330"
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the scores of Ava and Emma separately and then find the difference.

Let's assume Emma's score is x. 

Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's enemy score is x + 8. 
Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, Ava's berry score is x + 3.
Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, Ava's timer score is (60 - (x + 4)) because the total time for the level is 60 seconds.

Emma's score is x + (number of enemies Emma jumps on) + (number of berries Emma collects) + (time left on Emma's timer).
Emma's score is x + 0 + 0 + (60 - x) = 60.

Ava's score is (x + 8) + (x + 3) + (60 - (x + 4)) = 2x + 7.

The difference in their scores is (2x + 7) - 60 = 2x - 53.

However, we don't know the value of x. We need to find the value of x to calculate the difference in their scores.

Since Emma's score is 60, we can set up the equation: x + 0 + 0 + (60 - x) = 60.
Simplifying the equation, we get 60 = 60.

This equation is true for any value of x. However, we can still find the difference in their scores by finding the difference in their enemy and berry scores.

The difference in their enemy scores is (x + 8) - x = 8.
The difference in their berry scores is (x + 3) - 0 = x + 3.

The difference in their timer scores is (60 - (x + 4)) - (60 - x) = -4.

The total difference in their scores is 8 + (x + 3) - 4 = x + 7.

Since we don't know the value of x, we can't find the exact difference in their scores. However, we can express the difference in terms of x.

But, we can also find the minimum and maximum possible difference in their scores.

The minimum difference in their scores is when Emma has the lowest possible score, which is 0. In this case, the difference in their scores is 7.

The maximum difference in their scores is when Emma has the highest possible score, which is 60. In this case, the difference in their scores is 7 + x.

However, we can also find the difference in their scores by finding the difference in their timer scores. The difference in their timer scores is -4. 

Since the difference in their timer scores is -4, Ava's timer score is 4 less than Emma's timer score. 

The difference in their scores is the difference in their enemy scores plus the difference in their berry scores plus the difference in their timer scores. 

The difference in their scores is 8 + (x + 3) - 4 = x + 7.

However, we can also find the difference in their scores by finding the difference in their timer scores. The difference in their timer scores is -4.

The difference in their scores is 8 + 3 - 4 = 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to find the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. 

The two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each will be 2 x 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of the two known pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. 

64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on usual days and the extra days to get the total number of times they ride in a week: 15 + 12 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's break down the information given:

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 orange and 4 white.

After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. Since he had 3 orange fish initially, and he bought some more orange fish, the total number of orange fish he has now is 3 + (some number of orange fish he bought). Since he has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 + (some number of orange fish he bought) = 2 * (4 + x)

We also know that the total number of fish he bought is 17, and this includes both white and orange fish. Since he initially had 7 fish, the total number of fish he has now is 7 + 17 = 24. The number of white fish he has now is 4 + x, and the number of orange fish he has now is 3 + (some number of orange fish he bought). We can set up another equation:

4 + x + 3 + (some number of orange fish he bought) = 24

Since we know that 3 + (some number of orange fish he bought) = 2 * (4 + x), we can substitute this into the second equation:

4 + x + 2 * (4 + x) = 24

Simplifying the equation:

4 + x + 8 + 2x = 24

Combine like terms:

3x + 12 = 24

Subtract 12 from both sides:

3x = 12

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 4

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in a week and then multiply it by the fuel efficiency and the price of gas.

First, let's calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 5 * 2 = 10 miles per day. 

The total distance traveled in a week is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, let's calculate the amount of fuel consumed in a week. The fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, so the amount of fuel consumed is the total distance traveled divided by the fuel efficiency: 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost of fuel consumed in a week. The price of gas is $3/gallon, so the total cost is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent, and then add them together.

First, let's find the value of the quarters. Carrie was given 140 quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25. 

Value of quarters = Number of quarters * Value of each quarter
Value of quarters = 140 * $0.25
Value of quarters = $35

Next, let's find the value of the twenties she spent. Carrie was given 10 twenties, but she spent 3/5 of them. 

Number of twenties spent = 10 * 3/5
Number of twenties spent = 6

Value of twenties spent = Number of twenties spent * Value of each twenty
Value of twenties spent = 6 * $20
Value of twenties spent = $120

Now, let's add the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties to find the total amount of money she paid for lunch.

Total amount spent = Value of quarters + Value of twenties spent
Total amount spent = $35 + $120
Total amount spent = $155

The final answer is: $155"
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

Total tomatoes = 5 * 22
Total tomatoes = 110

For eggplants:
Number of eggplant plants = 8
Eggplants per plant = 4
Total eggplants = Number of eggplant plants * Eggplants per plant
Total eggplants = 8 * 4
Total eggplants = 32

Total fruits = Total tomatoes + Total eggplants
Total fruits = 110 + 32
Total fruits = 142

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to find the total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 or 0.25. One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 or 0.125. 

The total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 0.25 + 0.125 = 0.375. 

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the total percentage of smart and analog TVs from 1 (which represents 100% of the total TVs). 

1 - 0.375 = 0.625. 

Now, we multiply 0.625 by the total number of TVs sold, which is 40. 

0.625 * 40 = 25.

"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first determine how much the school will cover and then subtract that from the total cost of the trip. 

The school will cover half the cost of the trip, which is $300 / 2 = $150. 

Since John already has $50, we need to subtract the amount the school will cover and the amount John has from the total cost of the trip to find out how much more money he needs. 

$300 (total cost) - $150 (school's contribution) - $50 (John's contribution) = $100.

John is missing $100."
"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature difference between the current temperature and the temperature at which the pipes will freeze. 

The current temperature during the day is 45 degrees. The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than the day, so it's 45 - 33 = 12 degrees. 

The temperature difference between the current temperature and the freezing point is 32 - 12 = 20 degrees. 

Since each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, we need to divide the temperature difference by the amount of heat each log provides. 

20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs.

"To find the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to find the number of groups formed and then the number of groups that brought back seashells.

The total number of people is 90, and they are split into 9-person groups. To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of people by the number of people per group:

90 / 9 = 10 groups

Since 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of the total number of groups:

3/5 * 10 = 6 groups

Each of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells. To find the total number of seashells, we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells each group brought back:

6 * 2 = 12

Initially, there are 172 people on the train.

At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
172 - 47 = 125

Then, 13 people get on the train, so we add 13 to 125:
125 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
138 - 38 = 100

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since Bubbles can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage 30%, so we will round to the nearest whole number that will make the percentage 30% or more. 

To find the total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats, we can set up the equation: 

(14 + x) * 0.3 = 30% of (14 + x), where x is the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy.

However, we can also solve this problem by setting up a proportion: 

(14 / (14 + x)) = 0.7 (since 100% - 30% = 70%)

Now, we can cross-multiply and solve for x: 

14 = 0.7(14 + x)
14 = 9.8 + 0.7x
14 - 9.8 = 0.7x
4.2 = 0.7x
x = 4.2 / 0.7
x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats."

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to determine how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and he has 2 bags of glass chips, we need to find out how many chips he has in total. Each bag holds 72 chips, so 2 bags will hold 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Now, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of chips needed to make one square inch of the mosaic. 144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches.

Since the mosaic is three inches tall, and we know the area of the mosaic (12 square inches), we can find the length of the mosaic by dividing the area by the height. 

Area = length * height
12 square inches = length * 3 inches
length = 12 square inches / 3 inches
length = 4 inches

"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount of tea each group of students drank and add them together.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea they drank is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea they drank is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea consumed from quarts to gallons by dividing by 4: 38 / 4 = 9.5 gallons.

However, the question asks for the amount of tea at the beginning of the party. We know that 38 quarts of tea were consumed, and there are 10 quarts left. To find the initial amount of tea, we need to add the amount of tea consumed to the amount of tea left: 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert the initial amount of tea from quarts to gallons, we divide by 4: 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to first determine how many candies he has in total. 

Dale initially ordered 100 candies and then sold 150. However, he still had 100 candies left after selling 150. So, he ordered 100 more. 

First, let's calculate how many candies he had after selling 150 out of the initial 100. 
100 (initial candies) - 150 (candies sold) = -50 (shortage of candies)

Since he can't have a negative number of candies, this means he didn't have enough candies to sell 150. He only had 100 candies. 

So, he ordered 100 more candies. 
Now, he has 100 (initial candies) + 100 (additional candies) = 200 candies in total.

He sold 150 candies. 
200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50 candies left to sell.

Doubling 320 for the sixth time: 320 * 2 = 640
Doubling 640 for the seventh time: 640 * 2 = 1280
Doubling 1280 for the eighth time: 1280 * 2 = 2560
Doubling 2560 for the ninth time: 2560 * 2 = 5120
Doubling 5120 for the tenth time: 5120 * 2 = 10240
Doubling 10240 for the eleventh time: 10240 * 2 = 20480
Doubling 20480 for the twelfth time: 20480 * 2 = 40960

Now, we need to find the number of additional students who joined by the end of May. To do this, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May.

40960 - 10 = 40950

The final answer is: 40950"
"To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25).

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (5 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used and the ones dropped from the initial number of marshmallows. 

Total marshmallows used = 9 (John) + 9 (DeSean) = 18
Marshmallows dropped = 3
Total marshmallows used and dropped = 18 + 3 = 21

Initial number of marshmallows = 35
Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores each kid can have is equal to the number of marshmallows left divided by 2 (since there are two kids).

Number of S'mores each kid can have = 14 / 2 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the total time played by each person and then multiply it by the cost per minute. 

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. 
Two of his friends can play for half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. 
One of his friends can play for 1.5 times as long, so they can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter.

The total time played is 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Jack's time: 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters
Two friends' time: 240 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters * 2 = 48 quarters
Better friend's time: 240 minutes / 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters

Total quarters used = 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 * 0.25 = $17.

The final answer is: $17"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Tanya makes a 10-ounce jar of the salt scrub.
2. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
3. She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
4. She uses twice as much oil as salt.
5. She uses twice as much salt as zest.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as Z, the amount of salt (and sugar) as S, and the amount of oil as O.

From point 5, we know that S = 2Z.

From point 4, we know that O = 2S.

Substituting S = 2Z into O = 2S, we get O = 2(2Z) = 4Z.

Now, we know that the total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces, which is the sum of the amounts of oil, salt, sugar, fragrance, and citrus zest. Since sugar and salt are the same, and fragrance and citrus zest are the same, we can write the equation as:

O + S + S + Z + Z = 10

Substituting S = 2Z and O = 4Z into the equation, we get:

4Z + 2Z + 2Z + Z + Z = 10

Combine like terms:

10Z = 10

Divide both sides by 10:

Z = 1

Now that we know Z = 1, we can find S and O:

S = 2Z = 2(1) = 2

O = 4Z = 4(1) = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats is 3 * $500 = $1500.
The cost of the cows is 2 * $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Cupcakes already have = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy = Total cupcakes needed - Cupcakes already have
= 63 - 48
= 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars. So, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2. 40 * 0.2 = 8. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

4. Now, we need to find out how many cars Joe has left. He started with 40 cars, sold 8, and gave away 16. So, he has 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine the total amount raised by the students. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the amount raised by the students is:

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Now, we know that 20 students raised this amount together. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the number of students:

$125,000 / 20 = $6,250

So each student raised $6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

Now, we add the time from both days:
480 minutes + 240 minutes = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first find the total number of cars in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break.

Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 of the cars had left. This means that 1/2 of 70 cars had left, which is (1/2) * 70 = 35 cars.

So, the number of cars that remained in the parking lot during the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35 cars.

However, the question asks for the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break, which is the number of cars that were present in the parking lot during the lunch break, not the number of cars that left. Therefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how much John makes in a day, we need to calculate the total amount he earns from one cycle and then multiply it by the number of cycles he does in a day.

Each cycle has 5 tasks and each task pays $1.20. So, the total amount he earns from one cycle is:
5 tasks * $1.20/task = $6.00 per cycle

Since John does 30 cycles a day, his daily earnings are:
$6.00/cycle * 30 cycles = $180.00 per day

To find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7:
$180.00/day * 7 days = $1260.00

The final answer is: $1260.00"
"To find the total points Sasha scored, we need to calculate her points in both games. 

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 
In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. 
So, in the second game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.

To find the total points Sasha scored, we add her points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages of dog food by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food: 88 - 36 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341.

Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47.

Since Becca has 3x + 12 cards, we can substitute x = 47 into the equation: Becca has 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs.

She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had (1/3) * 9 = 3 yellow eggs.

To find the total number of eggs, we add the number of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost:

Shipping cost per pound: $0.35
Total weight of the book: 4 pounds
Shipping cost = 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40

Shipping cost per mile: $0.08
Distance to the distribution center: 20 miles
Additional shipping cost = 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60

Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.00

Now, let's calculate the refund amount:

Purchase price of the book: $32
Refund percentage: 75%
Refund amount = $32 * 0.75 = $24

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:

Total shipping cost: $2.00
Refund amount: $24
Loss = Total shipping cost - Refund amount
Loss = $2.00 - $24 = -$22.00

However, since we can't lose a negative amount of money, we need to consider the actual loss as the absolute value of the loss.

"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to follow the order of operations:

1. First, we add the money Mulan initially had to the money her father gave her: $40 + $100 = $140.
2. Then, we subtract the cost of the two pairs of jeans: $140 - $30 (first pair) = $110, then $110 - $30 (second pair) = $80.
3. Finally, we subtract the cost of the bag: $80 - $20 = $60.

Mulan has $60 left."
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week:

1. Time spent recording videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes
2. Time spent writing songs: 2 hours = 120 minutes
3. Time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes

Total time spent on TikTok in a week = 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4:

Total time spent on TikTok in a month = 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1128 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

1128 minutes / 60 = 18.8 hours

The final answer is: 1128"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. However, Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, we only need to consider the additional items. 

Angela has 6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors, 2 - 1 = 1 additional chandelier, and 20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures.

The cost of the additional items is 2 mirrors * $15.00 = $30.00, 1 chandelier * $15.00 = $15.00, and 10 pictures * $15.00 = $150.00.

The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

The initial installation cost is $129.00. 

The total cost is $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to determine the lifting capacity of each person relative to Pompei. 

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches. 
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches. 
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 
480 / 12 = 40 feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, one kangaroo would take 18 hours multiplied by 3, which equals 54 hours.

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. Since speed is inversely proportional to time, if the turtles are traveling at half the speed, they will take twice as long to travel the same distance. 

So, if one kangaroo takes 54 hours to travel across the highway, four turtles traveling at half the speed will take 54 hours multiplied by 2, which equals 108 hours.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution.

First, let's calculate the price of the new laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 (original price) - $200 (discount) = $400

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so she must have $400 - $50 = $350.

She received $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom, so the total amount of money she received from these sources is $150 + $80 = $230.

Now, let's subtract the amount she received from the total amount she needs to buy the laptop:
$350 (total needed) - $230 (received) = $120

This means Erika already had $120 in her purse before receiving her payment and her mom's contribution.

"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to find out how many liters of milk one cow produces per day. 

Since the farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow, and he has 3 cows, the total amount of milk he gets from 3 cows is 5 * 3 = 15 liters per day.

Now, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk per day. We can do this by dividing the total amount of milk needed (25 liters) by the amount of milk one cow produces (5 liters). 

25 / 5 = 5 cows.

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to find out how many more cows he needs to have to reach 5 cows. 

5 (total cows needed) - 3 (cows the farmer already has) = 2.

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which is 1/6 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 1/6:
12 * (1/6) = 12/6 = 2 millimeters

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which is 2/3 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 2/3:
12 * (2/3) = 24/3 = 8 millimeters

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which is 1/2 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 1/2:
12 * (1/2) = 12/2 = 6 millimeters

Now, we add the unused portions of the glue sticks together:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90 socks
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90 dishes

Total number of socks and dishes together = 90 + 90 = 180

"To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider the total number of students and the number of students good at both subjects. 

Let's denote the number of students good at both math and English as x. We know that the total number of students is 20, and the number of students good at math only is 5, and the number of students good at English only is 8.

We can set up the equation: 5 (math only) + 8 (English only) + x (both) = 20 (total)

Simplifying the equation, we get: 13 + x = 20

Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get: x = 7

However, we are asked to find the number of students good at math. Since x represents the number of students good at both subjects, we need to add the number of students good at math only (5) to x to get the total number of students good at math.

So, the number of students good at math is 5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12.

"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we need to determine how many trays he can fill with 900 eggs. 

Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray to find the number of trays:

900 eggs / 30 eggs per tray = 30 trays

Now, we can multiply the number of trays by the price per tray to find the total earnings:

30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the number of goats left in Farm X, we need to subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in Farm X. 

Number of goats in Farm X = 55
Number of goats sold from Farm X = 10
Number of goats left in Farm X = 55 - 10 = 45

To find the number of goats sold from Farm Y, we are told that it is twice as many as the number of goats sold from Farm X. 

Number of goats sold from Farm X = 10
Number of goats sold from Farm Y = 2 * 10 = 20

To find the number of goats left in Farm Y, we need to subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in Farm Y.

Number of goats in Farm Y = 45
Number of goats sold from Farm Y = 20
Number of goats left in Farm Y = 45 - 20 = 25

Now, we need to find the total number of goats left in both farms. 

Total number of goats left = Number of goats left in Farm X + Number of goats left in Farm Y
Total number of goats left = 45 + 25
Total number of goats left = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs bought per year.

First, let's find the number of pairs of shoes James buys per year. Since he buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, and there are 12 months in a year, he buys 2 * 12 = 24 pairs of shoes per year.

Now, we can divide the total amount spent on shoes per year ($2640) by the number of pairs bought per year (24) to find the average cost per pair:

$2640 / 24 = $110

The final answer is: $110"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, then subtract the discount for the red food.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.
The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54.
The total cost before discount is $75 + $54 = $129.
Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6.
The total cost after discount is $129 - $6 = $123.

The final answer is: $123"
"To find the number of rooms to be cleaned, we need to calculate one-half of the total rooms. 

One-half of 90 rooms is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we need to multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes per room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years, which is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Then, they will double this amount, so 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, we add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

The final answer is: 144"
"Let's denote my age as 'x'. Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age is x + 3. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, which can be expressed as 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of all our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs, we need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required and then divide that by the number of glue sticks in each pack.

Total number of students: 27
Number of glue sticks per student: 2
Total number of glue sticks required: 27 * 2 = 54

Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by 8 to find out how many packs are needed.

54 Ã· 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are asked to assume he will have some extra glue sticks left over, so we will round up to the nearest whole number.

6.75 â†’ 7

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

Day 1: 10 people are infected initially.
Day 2: 10 * 6 = 60 new infections, plus the 10 people from the previous day, so 60 + 10 = 70 people are infected.
Day 3: 70 * 6 = 420 new infections, plus the 70 people from the previous day, so 420 + 70 = 490 people are infected.

"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total tips. 

Rafaela received $20 from each of the 40 customers, so her total tips are 40 * $20 = $800.

10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80. 

Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, so she received $800 - $80 = $720.

The total amount of money they received as tips is $800 (Rafaela's tips) + $720 (Julieta's tips) = $1520.

She gave her son 3 oranges. 
So, the total number of oranges given to her children is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges initially. 
To find out how many oranges she remained with, we subtract the total number of oranges given to her children from the initial number of oranges.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each person would be:

- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:

36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold, and then multiply that by the price per slice.

First, let's find out how many hours she baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours.

Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, and each loaf is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices she baked per hour is 2 * 8 = 16 slices.

In 5 hours, she baked 16 * 5 = 80 slices.

Since each slice is sold for 50 cents, we need to convert the total number of slices to dollars. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so we can divide the total number of slices by 100 to get the total amount in dollars.

80 slices / 100 = 0.8 dollars per slice.

Now, we multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice to get the total amount raised:

80 slices * 0.8 dollars/slice = 64 dollars.

"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to determine the number of silver coins she has. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and she has 70 gold coins, we can set up an equation to represent the relationship between the number of gold and silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. 

The equation would be: x + (x + 30) = 70 (since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins)

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 70

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20

So, Gretchen has 20 silver coins. 

Now, to find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins: 70 (gold coins) + 20 (silver coins) = 90

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we first need to calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. 

There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George ate 20 burritos. 

The total number of burritos ordered was 600. 

To find the total number of leftover burritos, we subtract the number of burritos given to the students and the number eaten by Mr. George from the total number of burritos ordered. 

So, the total number of leftover burritos is 600 - (500 + 20) = 600 - 520 = 80.

"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We are given the following information:

1. S + A + F = 85 (Together, they have 85 books)
2. S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can use substitution to solve for F. 

From equation 2, we can express S in terms of A: S = A + 25.

Substituting this into equation 1, we get: (A + 25) + A + F = 85

Combine like terms: 2A + F + 25 = 85

Subtract 25 from both sides: 2A + F = 60

Now, we can express A in terms of F using equation 3: A = F - 12

Substitute this into the equation above: 2(F - 12) + F = 60

Distribute the 2: 2F - 24 + F = 60

Combine like terms: 3F - 24 = 60

Add 24 to both sides: 3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3: F = 28

The seller gives the electronics seller $4000 in dollar bills. To find the change, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given:
$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to find out how much Keenan spends per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

First, let's find 40% of $400. 
40% of $400 = 0.4 * $400 = $160

Since Keenan pays $160 per month, we need to divide this by 4 to find out how much he spends per week. 
$160 / 4 = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them up.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5:
(2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find the remaining pieces after the first two days, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26:
(7/13) * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

Now, we add up the pieces eaten on each day:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Therefore, Tobias has eaten 48 pizza pieces so far.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we first need to find the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of one bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of one bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water by multiplying the cost of one bottle of soda by 3 and the cost of one bottle of water by 2, then adding the results together.

The cost of 3 bottles of soda is 3 x $3.00 = $9.00.
The cost of 2 bottles of water is 2 x $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost is $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

The final answer is: $13.00"
"To find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts and subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

The cost of each bolt is $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts. 

Total cost of bolts = Number of bolts * Cost per bolt
Total cost of bolts = 16 * $0.03
Total cost of bolts = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:

Initial amount of money = $12.48
Total cost of bolts = $0.48
Money left = Initial amount of money - Total cost of bolts
Money left = $12.48 - $0.48
Money left = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to determine her hourly rate. We can do this by dividing the amount she earned by the number of hours she worked.

Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of work. 

Hourly rate = Total earnings / Number of hours worked
Hourly rate = $33 / 3
Hourly rate = $11

Now that we know her hourly rate, we can calculate her earnings for 12 hours.

Earnings for 12 hours = Hourly rate * Number of hours worked
Earnings for 12 hours = $11 * 12
Earnings for 12 hours = $132

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she gets from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
Amy correctly answers 80% of 10 questions, so she answers 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correctly.
Each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, so she gets 8 * 1 = 8 points from multiple-choice questions.

For true/false questions: 
Amy correctly answers 90% of 20 questions, so she answers 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correctly.
Each true/false question is worth 1 point, so she gets 18 * 1 = 18 points from true/false questions.

For long-answer questions: 
Amy correctly answers 60% of 5 questions, so she answers 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correctly.
Each long-answer question is worth 5 points, so she gets 3 * 5 = 15 points from long-answer questions.

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

Number of chickens to sell = 300 * (3/5)
= 300 * 0.6
= 180 chickens

Since he plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 per chicken, the total revenue from selling these chickens will be:

Total revenue = Number of chickens to sell * Price per chicken
= 180 * $50
= $9000

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, the total cost of the chickens he bought must be the total revenue minus the profit:

Total cost = Total revenue - Profit
= $9000 - $2000
= $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000."
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 2, since they sold an equal number of glasses. 

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people selling glasses = 2 (Micah and Mitchell)
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / Number of people selling glasses
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = 32 / 2
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = 16

Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah. To do this, we subtract the number of glasses sold by Micah from the number of glasses sold by Julie.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 16
Difference in glasses sold = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah
Difference in glasses sold = 14 - 16
Difference in glasses sold = -2

"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we need to calculate the total amount of money she gets from selling the rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Sarah gets from selling the rope:
Length of the rope = 20 meters
Price per meter = $2
Total amount of money = Length of the rope * Price per meter
Total amount of money = 20 * $2
Total amount of money = $40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope:
Length of the new rope = 20 meters (assuming it's the same length as the original rope)
Price per meter of the new rope = $1.5
Cost of the new rope = Length of the new rope * Price per meter of the new rope
Cost of the new rope = 20 * $1.5
Cost of the new rope = $30

Now, let's subtract the cost of the new rope from the total amount of money Sarah gets from selling the rope:
Amount of money left over = Total amount of money - Cost of the new rope

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Melanie's present age be x.

In 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. This means that her current age plus 10 years is equal to 18. We can write this as an equation:

x + 10 = 18

To find Melanie's current age, we need to solve for x. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

x = 18 - 10
x = 8

So, Melanie's current age is 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's call this number y. We can write this as an equation:

Melanie's age in y years = 3 * Melanie's current age
8 + y = 3 * 8

To find y, we can simplify the equation:

8 + y = 24

Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

y = 24 - 8
y = 16

So, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age in 16 years.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken. Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and a pack of bacon costs $10 in total for 5 packs, the cost of one pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2. Therefore, the cost of one packet of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4. Since Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is $4 * 6 = $24.

Next, let's find the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is $4 * 3 = $12.

Now, let's find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Since Kelly has 7 packs of apples, the total cost of the apples is $2 * 7 = $14.

The total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart is $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $60 = $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"Let's denote the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts as 'x' minutes. 

Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, its runtime is 2x minutes. 

The encore is 15 minutes long. 

The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, which is the sum of the runtime of the concert and the encore. 

We can write the equation as: 2x + 15 = 65

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. 

Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 50 / 2
x = 25

The runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

"To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs. 

Let's assume the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is x. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the total number of microphones arranged in pairs is 2x.

However, we know that 20% of the total 50 microphones won't find any space to fit in. This means that 80% of the microphones will be arranged in pairs. 

We can set up the equation: 80% of 50 = 2x

To find 80% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.8: 
50 * 0.8 = 40

Now we have the equation: 40 = 2x

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
x = 40 / 2
x = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.

Then, 2/3rd of 6 birds are flying overhead. To find 2/3rd of 6, we multiply 6 by 2 and divide by 3:
(6 * 2) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4

So, 4 birds are flying overhead.

Next, Jerry sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we multiply the number of groups by the number of birds in each group:
3 * 8 = 24

Now, we add the number of birds in each group together:
6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids."
"To find the percentage of flowering plants, we first need to determine the number of flowering plants. 

There are 100 plants in total. One-fourth of them are indoor plants, which is 100 * (1/4) = 25 plants. 

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75 plants. Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, which is 75 * (2/3) = 50 plants. 

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants, which is 75 - 50 = 25 plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25/100) * 100 = 25%.

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up an equation to find the speed of the thingamabob.

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x. Then, the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11x. We know that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, so we can set up the equation:

11x = 121

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 11:

x = 121 / 11
x = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob is 11 meters per second, we can find the speed of the whirligig. The whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob, so we can multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55

"Let's break down the information given:

- Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day.
- The salad costs $6.
- The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.
- In total, Ellen pays $11 for her goods.

We know that the total cost of the goods is $11, and the cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. This means the cost of two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

Since Ellen eats two carrots every day, the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we can multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week to find his weekly earnings: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is 3x. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is 5x.

The total amount of money Tasha made from mowing lawns is the sum of the money she made from mowing each lawn. Since she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, the total amount of money she made from mowing lawns is 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x.

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Since she made 54x from mowing lawns, the amount of money she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 54x.

We are also given that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, so we can set up the equation 6x = 6 to find the value of x.

6x = 6
x = 1

Now that we know x = 1, we can find the amount of money Tasha made from lemonade sales by substituting x into the equation 80 - 54x.

80 - 54(1) = 80 - 54 = 26

"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we first need to find the distance rowed by Anis. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find 1/5 of Dijana's distance, we multiply 50 by 1/5. 

50 * (1/5) = 10

So, Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana. To find the total distance rowed by Anis, we add 10 to Dijana's distance.

Anis' distance = 50 + 10 = 60 miles

Now, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance.

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110 miles

Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies, so we subtract 4 from 100 to get the remaining cookies: 100 - 4 = 96.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. To do this, we divide 96 by 6: 96 Ã· 6 = 16.

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies."
"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today.

So, Denise's total pages read is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel's total pages read is 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total: 28 - 13 = 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bowls of soup Calvin's family will use for dinner and then divide the total capacity of the pot by that number to find out how many times the children can have a bowl of soup for lunch.

Calvin, his wife, and their two children make a total of 4 adults and 2 children, which is 6 people. Since everyone eats one bowl at a meal, they will use 6 bowls for dinner.

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child's bowls. Since the children's bowls are smaller, we can assume that 4 adult bowls are equivalent to 6 child's bowls (since 4 adult bowls = 8 child's bowls). 

So, the pot can fill 8 child's bowls. 

To find out how many times the children can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we divide the total capacity of the pot (8 child's bowls) by the number of bowls used for dinner (6 bowls). 

8 / 6 = 1.33 

Since we can't have a fraction of a bowl, we round down to 1.33, but in this context, it means the children can have a bowl of soup for lunch once and there will be some leftover soup."

We know that Duncan's current age is 60, so we can find his age eight years ago by subtracting 8 from 60:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 60 - 8
Duncan's age eight years ago = 52

Now we can equate this to 2x:

52 = 2x

To find x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 52 / 2
x = 26

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to x:

Adam's current age = x + 4
Adam's current age = 26 + 4
Adam's current age = 30

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = Adam's current age + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres in Farmer Smith's farm, we need to calculate twice the number of acres in Farmer Brown's farm and then add 100 to it.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres. Adding 100 to that gives us 400 + 100 = 500 acres for Farmer Smith's farm.

Now, we need to add the number of acres in both farms to find the total. Farmer Brown's farm has 200 acres, and Farmer Smith's farm has 500 acres. So, 200 + 500 = 700 acres.

The final answer is: 700"
"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes in that time and then multiply it by the amount he gets paid per package.

Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

In an 8-hour workday, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, his total earnings for the day would be 320 * $0.20 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve a normal sudoku and an extreme sudoku, and then add those times together. 

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, which is 4 * 45 = 180 minutes. 

The total time it takes to solve both puzzles is 45 + 180 = 225 minutes. 

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 225 minutes is 225 / 60 = 3.75 hours.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, he drinks 1 bottle every 0.5 hours. To find out how many bottles he drinks in 3.75 hours, we can divide 3.75 by 0.5, which is 7.5. 

However, since you can't drink half a bottle of water, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we round up to 8 bottles.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
- Total bologna thrown = 58
- Number of red balloons = 20

Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, the total bologna thrown at red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, let's find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at yellow balloons. Since the total bologna thrown is 58 and 40 were thrown at red balloons, the bologna thrown at yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons is 18 / 3 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in a 30-day month. 

Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, the total miles driven in 30 days is:
100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we need to divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs:
3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total hours Bruce works, we need to calculate the hours he works each day and add them up.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. 1 dozen balloons is equal to 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, 12 balloons will cost 12 * $0.5 = $6.

The total cost of the cake and the balloons is $11 + $6 = $17.

They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total cost of the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount of money they spent is $17 + $14 = $31.

Since they spent $31 in total, and they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount by 2 to find out how much each of them received. 

$31 / 2 = $15.50

The final answer is: $15.50"
"To find out how many pieces of fruit Kira bought in total, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges. 

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit, we need to subtract 2 from the total number of fruits Kira bought.

14 - 2 = 12

So, there are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer, and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of students playing tennis. There are 6 students playing tennis, and twice that number are playing volleyball. So, the number of students playing volleyball is 6 * 2 = 12.

Next, we add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball: 6 + 12 = 18.

Now, we add the number of students playing soccer: 18 + 16 + 22 = 56.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total profit made by the class, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since each student sold 10 lollipops on average and there are 30 students, the total number of lollipops sold is:

Total lollipops sold = 10 lollipops/student * 30 students = 300 lollipops

The total revenue is the total number of lollipops sold multiplied by the selling price of each lollipop:

Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240

The total cost is the total number of lollipops bought multiplied by the cost of each lollipop:

Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $240 - $150 = $90

Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

$90"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them up.

Larry has 3 cats.

He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add up the number of each type of pet: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The final answer is: 47"
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to determine the total number of slices both Abby and Josh can eat per day. 

Abby can eat 2 slices a day. 
Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, so Josh can eat 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day.

Together, they can eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days it will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat per day: 24 / 6 = 4.

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To find out how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and we want to know the total by her 10th birthday, we need to count the months from her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday.

From 5 to 10 years old is 5 years. There are 12 months in a year, so 5 years is 5 * 12 = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell every month, we multiply the total number of months by 1 shell per month.

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday."
"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea in each row. 

Since Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, we can find the number of cups in each row by dividing 27 by 3. 

27 / 3 = 9 cups in each row.

Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is half of the total cups in each row.

9 / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea in each row.

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a cup, we can assume that the 4.5 cups of mint tea in each row are made up of 4 full cups and 0.5 cups. The 0.5 cups can be distributed between the chamomile tea and the mint tea in each row, but since the question asks for the number of cups of mint tea, we can ignore the 0.5 cups for now.

The remaining cups are used to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea. To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we need to find out how many cups of mint tea are in total and subtract that from the total number of cups in each row.

Since there are 3 rows, the total number of cups of mint tea is 3 * 4.5 = 13.5 cups.

However, we know that the remaining cups are used to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea. To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we need to find out how many cups of mint tea are in total and subtract that from the total number of cups in each row.

Since there are 27 - 15 = 12 cups of chamomile and mint tea left, and we know that there are 3 rows, the total number of cups of mint tea is 12 - 9 = 3 cups of chamomile tea in each row, but we are looking for the number of cups of mint tea. Since the number of cups of chamomile and mint tea in each row is equal, we can assume that the 3 cups of chamomile tea in each row are made up of 3 - 0.5 = 2.5 cups of chamomile tea and 0.5 cups of mint tea. The 0.5 cups of mint tea in each row can be distributed between the chamomile tea and the mint tea in each row, but since the question asks for the number of cups of mint tea, we can ignore the 0.5 cups for now.

However, we can find the number of cups of mint tea in each row by subtracting the number of cups of chamomile tea from the total number of cups in each row.

9 - 3 = 6 cups of mint tea in each row.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick per trip. 

Let's break down the problem: 

- The sloth has 8 hours to collect 24 berries.
- Each trip down, up, and back takes 4 hours, so the sloth can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips in 8 hours.
- Since the sloth picks the same number of berries on each trip, let's call the number of berries picked per trip 'x'.
- The total number of berries picked in 2 trips is 2x.
- We want to find the minimum value of 'x' such that 2x = 24.

To find the minimum value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

2x = 24
x = 24 / 2
x = 12

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the amount of water in the tank after 6 days, we first need to determine how much water is initially transferred from the pool to the tank. Since they fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, we can calculate this as follows:

Initial water in the pool = 10000 gallons
Water transferred to the tank = 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons

Next, we need to find out how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so we can calculate the total water used as follows:

Water used per day = 500 gallons
Total days = 6
Total water used = 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons

Now, we can find the remaining water in the tank by subtracting the total water used from the initial amount transferred to the tank:

Remaining water in the tank = Initial water in the tank - Total water used
= 5000 - 3000
= 2000 gallons

The final answer is: 2000"
"To find out how many movies Colby can see, we need to first calculate how much money he has left. 

Colby's monthly budget is $150. He has already spent money on the following:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Money left: $150 - $130 = $20

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 and he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can see 1 more movie on a Friday or Saturday. 

Now, let's calculate how much money is left for other days: $20 - $10 = $10

Tickets for other days cost $7, so he can see $10 / $7 = 1.4286 (round down to 1) more movie on other days.

Total movies Colby can see: 1 (on Friday) + 1 (on other days) = 2

"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to first find the calories of a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we can find the total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls: 200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories.

Next, we can find the total calories of the mini blueberry muffins: 300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories.

Finally, we can find the total calories of all the pastries: 40,000 calories + 45,000 calories = 85,000 calories.

On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and John's age as J. 

We are given the following information:
1. P + Pp + J = 100
2. Pp = J + 10
3. P = Pp + J

From equation 2, we can substitute Pp with J + 10 in equation 1:
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
P + 2J + 10 = 100

From equation 3, we can substitute P with Pp + J:
Pp + J = Pp + J
This equation is true for all values of Pp and J, so we can't get any new information from it.

Now, we can substitute Pp with J + 10 in the equation P + 2J + 10 = 100:
(J + 10) + 2J + 10 = 100
Combine like terms:
3J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
3J = 80
Divide both sides by 3:
J = 80/3
J = 26.67

Now that we have J, we can find Pp:
Pp = J + 10
Pp = 26.67 + 10
Pp = 36.67

Now that we have Pp, we can find P:
P = Pp + J
P = 36.67 + 26.67
P = 63.34

"To find out how much hay Nate needs, we first need to determine the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. 
3 pounds less than 10 pounds is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now that we know each sheep needs 7 pounds, and there are 12 sheep, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep:

12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

We also know that there are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay:

15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds

To find the total amount of hay Nate needs, we add the amount needed for the goats and the amount needed for the sheep:

Total hay needed = 75 pounds (for goats) + 84 pounds (for sheep) = 159 pounds

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we need to calculate the original price and then subtract the discount. 

The original price of 10 CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James gets a 40% discount, we need to find 40% of $150. 
40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes James to swim 60% of the distance.
First, we need to find 60% of the total distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.
Then, we calculate the time it takes to swim 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour: time = distance / speed = 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

Step 2: Calculate the time James rests on the island.
Since he rests for half as long as the swimming time, the rest time is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Step 3: Calculate the remaining distance after swimming 12 miles.
The remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.

Step 4: Calculate the time it takes James to swim the remaining distance at half the speed.
The new speed is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.
The time it takes to swim the remaining distance is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

Step 5: Calculate the total time it takes James to get across the lake.
The total time is the sum of the swimming time, rest time, and the time it takes to swim the remaining distance: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday and then subtract 40 from that result.

Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had, so we subtract 40 from 490: 490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final answer is: 450"
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to follow the order of events and calculate the changes in her sticker count.

Initially, Jasmine was given 15 stickers for participating in class.

Then, she lost 7 stickers during playtime. So, we subtract 7 from 15:
15 - 7 = 8

After that, her teacher gave her another 5 stickers for helping her classmates. We add 5 to 8:
8 + 5 = 13

So, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

"To find the total commission earned by Cayley, we need to calculate the commission from the sales of the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal separately and then add them together.

Commission from New York Times:
- Number of copies sold: 6
- Price per copy: $5
- Commission rate: 10%
- Commission per copy: 10% of $5 = 0.1 * $5 = $0.5
- Total commission from New York Times: 6 * $0.5 = $3

Commission from Wall Street Journal:
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Price per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%
- Commission per copy: 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.2
- Total commission from Wall Street Journal: 10 * $1.2 = $12

Total commission earned by Cayley: $3 + $12 = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Deanna is 26 years old.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.
3. Marcus is half of Leo's age, so Leo's age is twice Marcus's age. 

To find Leo's age, we multiply Marcus's age by 2: 21 * 2 = 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D. 

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. 

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can set these two equations equal to each other: A + 20 = D + 10. 

Rearranging the equation, we get A - D = -10.

We also know that B + A + D = 45. 

Substituting B = A + 20 into the equation, we get (A + 20) + A + D = 45. 

Combine like terms: 2A + D + 20 = 45.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 2A + D = 25.

Now we have two equations: A - D = -10 and 2A + D = 25.

We can solve for A by adding the two equations: (A - D) + (2A + D) = -10 + 25.

This simplifies to 3A = 15.

Divide both sides by 3: A = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is 100 pages to the inch and each paper is printed on both sides, we have 200 pages per inch (100 pages per side).

Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:

200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked. He worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. 

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the total number of minutes he worked is:
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know that Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the total number of reports he stapled, we need to divide the total number of minutes he worked by 15 and then multiply by 30.

First, divide the total number of minutes by 15:
900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60

Now, multiply the result by 30:
60 * 30 = 1800

Therefore, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether."
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. This is a total of 8 hours, which is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. This means she slept for 480 - 5 = 475 minutes.

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find out how many minutes she slept on her bed, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from the total sleep time: 475 - 23 = 452 minutes.

The final answer is: 452"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. 

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen cups, we need to convert the number of cups to spoons. 

Two dozen cups is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 cups.

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we multiply the number of cups by 2/3 to find the number of spoons: 
24 cups * (2/3) = 16 spoons.

Now, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so we need to subtract 6 from the initial number of spoons to find the remaining number of spoons:
16 spoons - 6 spoons = 10 spoons.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the remaining spoons and the number of cups:
10 spoons + 24 cups = 34 utensils.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to first find the number of occupied beds and then subtract it from the total capacity.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. 

1/5 of 1000 = 100 beds occupied.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to find the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is equal to 14 days.

Total patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

Now, we add the initial occupied beds to the total patients admitted in 2 weeks to find the total occupied beds.

Total occupied beds = 100 beds + 700 beds = 800 beds

Now, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity to find the unoccupied beds.

Total unoccupied beds = 1000 beds - 800 beds = 200 beds

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to first find out how many emails are not work-related. 

Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. This means 6 emails are to family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after subtracting the work and family emails. 9 (non-work emails) - 6 (family emails) = 3.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.
2. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya.
3. Aliya is 3 years old.

From point 3, we know Aliya's age is 3 years. 

From point 2, we can calculate Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3:
Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years

From point 1, we can calculate Shawna's father's age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5:
Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years

"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number reported by Courtney and subtract it from the number reported by Courtney.

Let's assume the number reported by Courtney is 100%. 

20% of 48 = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48 to find the actual number of people who attended the concert.

Actual number of people = 48 - 9.6 = 38.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

Actual number of people = 38

The final answer is: 38"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Since Jason carried 2 balls, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey must have carried half of what Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan must have carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

However, this is the number of balls carried by the boys, not the total number of balls the coach brought to practice. Since the boys picked up and carried all of the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is equal to the number of balls the boys carried.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to first determine the total number of holes at the end of the third day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes the first day, 13 holes the second day, and 8 holes the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since there were 29 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got as 'x'. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so we can set up the equation: x = 70.

Since Collins got x + 15 corn chips, and we know x = 70, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we can find the total number of corn chips by adding the number of corn chips each person got: x + x + (x + 15) = 2x + (x + 15) = 3x + 15.

Substituting x = 70 into the equation, we get: 3(70) + 15 = 210 + 15 = 225.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of travel, we need to first determine the cost of the supplies, which is given as $400. 

Since the tickets for travel cost 50% more than the supplies, we need to calculate 50% of $400 and add it to the cost of the supplies.

50% of $400 is calculated as 0.5 * $400 = $200.

Now, we add this to the cost of the supplies: $400 + $200 = $600.

Therefore, the cost of travel is $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's denote the number of PokÃ©mon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L. 

We are given the following information:
1. A + S + L = 339
2. L = S + 5
3. S = 4A - 13

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to get:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, we can substitute the third equation into the above equation to get:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand the equation:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Now, add 21 to both sides of the equation:
9A = 360

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Then, let's calculate the distance traveled in the northerly direction:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled in the final southerly direction:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

Since the bird traveled 300 miles in the initial southerly direction, then 36 miles in the northerly direction, and finally 110 miles in the final southerly direction, we need to add the initial and final southerly distances and subtract the northerly distance:

Total southerly distance = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles
Total distance = 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles

She received 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office, which is 6 brownies. 
She received 4 dozen brownies from her friends, which is 48 brownies.

Total brownies received = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Total brownies eaten = 18

To find the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received:
66 - 18 = 48

"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we need to multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form).

Nani's sister's age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of all three family members: Nani (8 years), his brother (16 years), and his sister (6 years).

The total age of all three family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet.

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since there are 2 slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first determine how many oranges she had initially and then subtract the ones she kept and gave away.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. So, the total number of oranges she bought is 12 * 20 = 240.

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, which is a total of 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

She kept 1/4 of the oranges. To find out how many oranges that is, we need to calculate 1/4 of the total number of oranges she bought, which is 1/4 * 240 = 60 oranges.

Now, we subtract the oranges she kept and the ones she gave away from the total number of oranges she bought. So, the number of oranges she sold is 240 - 60 - 80 = 100.

"To find the total number of states in both countries together, we first need to find the number of states in the USA and India.

The USA has 50 states.

Let's assume the number of states in India is x. According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, we can write the equation as:

x = (50 / 2) + 4

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 25 + 4
x = 29

So, India has 29 states.

Now, to find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in the USA and India:

Total number of states = 50 (USA) + 29 (India)
Total number of states = 79

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is the sum of the cost of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook. 

Total cost = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn.

Amount needed to earn = Total cost - Amount saved = $39 - $14 = $25

Now, we can find out how many hours Tyler needs to work by dividing the amount he needs to earn by his hourly wage.

Hours to work = Amount needed to earn / Hourly wage = $25 / $5 = 5

"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we first need to determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can set up an equation to find out how many cherries Richard has:

Let R = Robert's cherries
Let R = R + 10 (since Robert has 10 more than Richard)
30 = R + 10
R = 20

So, Richard has 20 cherries. 

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 and 20 cherries respectively. To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we can subtract the total number of cherries that Robert and Richard have from the total number of cherries:

Total cherries = 60
Robert's cherries = 30
Richard's cherries = 20
Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - (Robert's cherries + Richard's cherries)
Jerry's cherries = 60 - (30 + 20)
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 50
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

Robert's cherries = 30
Jerry's cherries = 10
Difference = Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries
Difference = 30 - 10
Difference = 20

"Let's break down the information given:

- Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.
- On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so G = 10.
- On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so A = Sunday's apple pie - 4.
- On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so Sunday's gingerbread = G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.
- On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, we can find the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday. 
Sunday's apple pie = A + 4 = 15
A = 15 - 4 = 11

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for Saturday and Sunday.

- Total earnings on Saturday = (G * 6) + (A * 15) = (10 * 6) + (11 * 15) = 60 + 165 = 225
- Total earnings on Sunday = (Sunday's gingerbread * 6) + (Sunday's apple pie * 15) = (15 * 6) + (15 * 15) = 90 + 225 = 315

"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad and twice as old as his brother.

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's current age as D, and his brother's current age as B.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = 0.5D.

We can solve for D by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

D = 24 * 2
D = 48

Now, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B.

We can solve for B by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

B = 24 / 2
B = 12

Now that we know the ages of Emil's dad and brother when Emil turns 24, we need to find their current ages. Since Emil is 19 now, we need to subtract 5 years from their ages to find their current ages.

Dad's current age = 48 - 5 = 43
Brother's current age = 12 - 5 = 7

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is:

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie's boots are size 5, Charlie's boots are 5 * 5 = 25.

The average size of the shoes is the sum of their sizes divided by 2. So, the average size is (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to first convert the width of the flower bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant, we need to convert 1.5 feet to inches. 1.5 feet is equal to 1.5 * 12 = 18 inches.

The total space taken up by each plant and the space between them is the width of the plant plus the space between them, which is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed by the space taken up by each plant to find out how many plants can fit. 1332 / 30 = 44.4. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so Pat will spend 27 * 6 = $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate 1/2 of the number of pretzels Edgar eats in a day. 

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. 
1/2 of 18 is 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day by 7.

9 pretzels/day * 7 days = 63 pretzels

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00
The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Total cost = cost of petunias + cost of sweet potato vines = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations. 

4 sunflowers need 4 * 3 = 12 pounds of soil.
10 carnations need 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil.

The total amount of soil used for sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have a 30-pound bag of soil, the remaining soil for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so they can plant 3 / 1 = 3 roses.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income. 

25% of $2,000.00 is calculated as 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, we need to find out how much she saves in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply $500.00 by 12.

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so we divide $6,000.00 by $1,000.00.

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: peeling and cooking. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we need to find out how many batches of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp. 90 / 30 = 3. This means she needs to cook 3 batches of 30 shrimp each. Since each batch takes 10 minutes, the total cooking time is 3 * 10 = 30 minutes.

Now, we need to add the peeling and cooking times together. 15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature. 

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

However, the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is not running. Since the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how old Bill's dad was when Bill saw the comet for the second time. 

Since Bill saw the comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, let's call the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet ""x"". Then, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is 3x.

We know that the time between the two sightings is 75 years, so we can set up the equation:

x + 75 = 3x

Subtracting x from both sides of the equation gives us:

75 = 2x

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us:

x = 37.5

This is the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet. Since Bill was 30 years old when his dad saw the comet, we can find Bill's age when his dad was 37.5 years old by subtracting 37.5 from 30.

However, we are looking for Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, and Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, we can find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 from 30.

Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time = 30 - 75 = -45

However, this is not possible since age cannot be negative. This means that Bill's dad did not see the comet when Bill was 30 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as x. 

Since the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, the number of flights to Greece is (3/4)x. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/4)x.

The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, the number of flights made by the first plane is 2 * 44 = 88.

Now, we can equate the total number of flights made by the first plane to 88: x = 88.

We can now find the number of flights to France by substituting x into the equation for the number of flights to France: (1/4)x = (1/4) * 88 = 22.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings:

$30 (cost of trousers) - $18 (amount received from parents) = $12

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. We know that the total age of the children is 20, and Akbar and Alessandro are 3 and 4 years old, respectively. 

The total age of Akbar and Alessandro is 3 + 4 = 7. 

Since the total age of the children is 20, and we know the ages of two of them, we can set up an equation to find the combined age of Helene and Wilfred: 20 - 7 = 13. 

Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's denote the average age of the group as A. Then, Helene's age is 2A. 

The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 20/4 = 5. 

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, Helene's age is 2 * 5 = 10. 

Now, we know the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 13, and Helene is 10 years old. So, Wilfred's age is 13 - 10 = 3.

"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund.

Walter's friend gives him $200, but this is not included in the amount that the lawyer will donate. The lawyer will donate based on the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund.

So, the amount that the lawyer will donate is 3 times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, which is 3 * $2000 = $6000.

"To find the total number of cookies, we need to multiply the number of guests at the wedding by the number of cookies each guest brought. 

Total cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

Since the bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door, we need to find 1/2 of the total cookies.

Cookies given to the church = 1500 cookies * 1/2 = 750 cookies

Now, we know that each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church, we need to divide the number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got.

Number of people in the church = 750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

"To solve this problem, let's assume the total number of slices of the watermelon is 6 (since there are 6 people in the family). 

Let's denote the number of slices each kid gets as 'x'. Since each adult gets twice as big a slice as each kid, the number of slices each adult gets is 2x.

The total number of slices given to the kids is 4x (since there are 4 kids), and the total number of slices given to the adults is 2x + 2x = 4x (since there are 2 adults).

The total number of slices given to the family is 4x + 4x = 8x, which is equal to the total number of slices of the watermelon (6). 

So, 8x = 6. 

Dividing both sides by 8, we get x = 6/8 = 0.75.

Since each adult gets 2x slices, each adult gets 2 * 0.75 = 1.5 slices.

The total number of slices is 6, and each adult gets 1.5 slices, so the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (1.5/6) * 100 = 25%.

- Each inpatient takes 20 minutes, and there are 9 inpatients.
- Total time spent on rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes
- Convert minutes to hours: 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Time spent on appointments: 
- Each appointment takes 30 minutes, and there are 10 appointments.
- Total time spent on appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes
- Convert minutes to hours: 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

Total time spent on rounds and appointments = 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours

Total hours worked by Doctor Jones = 9 hours
Time left to update records = Total hours worked - Total time spent on rounds and appointments
= 9 hours - 8 hours
= 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

First, let's add the time it takes to make the cake batter (20 minutes) and bake the cake (30 minutes): 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.

Next, we add the time it takes for the cake to cool (2 hours, which is 120 minutes) and the time it takes to frost the cake (10 minutes): 120 + 10 = 130 minutes. 

Now, we add the time it takes to make the cake batter and bake the cake (50 minutes) to the time it takes for the cake to cool and frost (130 minutes): 50 + 130 = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

Now, we need to find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm. We subtract the total time required (3 hours) from the serving time (5:00 pm). 

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm.

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

The final answer is 2."
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We are given that they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation 8x = 64. 

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8: x = 64 / 8 = 8.

The number of chocolate bars in a box is 8."
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. So, the total number of sessions in a month is 3 sessions/day * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

The total cost per session is $40, and there are 12 sessions in a month. So, the total cost for the month is $40/session * 12 sessions = $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars they have by the number of boxes they have.

For Peter: 64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 56 chocolate bars / 7 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha. 
Difference = 16 - 8 = 8

"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

3/5 * 50 = 30

So, there are 30 female porcupines in the park.

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

30 * 4 * 12 = 1440

However, these babies are not yet part of the population at the beginning of the year. They are added to the population at the end of the year. 

The initial population is 50, and 1440 babies are added to it. 

50 + 1440 = 1490

Therefore, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year is 1490."
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed them to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need, we need to do that next.

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. To find the total cost, we need to multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon.

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

The final answer is: $826"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to find the number of blue and yellow sticks first. 

We know there are 9 red sticks. We also know that there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. So, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

We know the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks. So, the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many miles each person traveled, we need to multiply their speed by the time they traveled.

Matteo's distance = speed * time = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles
Shandy's distance = speed * time = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we need to find the difference between the two distances to see how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo.
Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we need to first find the number of students over 16 and under 16, and then find the number of female students in each group.

1. Total students = 3000
2. Students over 16 = 3000 / 2 = 1500
3. Male students over 16 = 1500 / 4 = 375
4. Female students over 16 = 1500 - 375 = 1125
5. Students under 16 = 3000 / 2 = 1500
6. Male students under 16 = 1500 / 2 = 750
7. Female students under 16 = 1500 - 750 = 750

"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. The total amount of water in the tank after the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons. The total amount of water in the tank after the second day is 7875 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so the amount of water remaining is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x%.

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is x - 5 * 9 = x - 45%.

In the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining is (x - 45) - 3 * 7 = x - 45 - 21 = x - 66%.

We are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. We can set up the equation:

x - 66 = 0.28

To solve for x, we need to isolate x:

x = 0.28 + 66
x = 66.28

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 66.28%."
"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work, we first need to calculate her total weekly income. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and she works 40 hours a week, so her weekly wage is 10 * 40 = $400.

She also makes $15 an hour from tips, so her total weekly income from tips is 15 * 40 = $600.

Her total weekly income is the sum of her wage and tips, which is 400 + 600 = $1000.

Now, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of the car, which is 0.2 * 10000 = $2000.

To find out how many weeks she needs to work, we divide the amount she needs to save by her total weekly income: 2000 / 1000 = 2.

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate how much money he has left after purchasing the fruits he already bought. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he has already purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Now, let's calculate how many plums he can buy with the remaining money:
Plums cost $0.25 each, so the number of plums he can buy is $0.75 / $0.25 = 3.

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. Since she kept 2 packs for herself, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Next, we need to find out how many pieces of sweets each pack contains. We already know that each pack has 60 pieces.

Now, we can find out the total number of pieces of sweets she gave away by multiplying the number of packs she gave away by the number of pieces in each pack: 13 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 780 pieces.

Finally, we can find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received by dividing the total number of pieces given away by the number of friends: 780 pieces / 10 friends = 78 pieces per friend.

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8.

Total pictures = 72
Pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
Pictures per album = 72 / 8
Pictures per album = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits, the remaining 3 albums must be a mix of both selfies and portraits. However, we are not given any information about the mix of selfies and portraits in these 3 albums. 

But we can still find the total number of selfies and portraits. Since 3 albums were selfies only, the total number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27. Similarly, since 2 albums were portraits only, the total number of portraits is 2 * 9 = 18.

The final answer is:

"To find out how many points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of questions in each category and then find out how many Aries is sure to get from each category.

First, let's find out how many questions are in each category:
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions
- Average and difficult questions: 60 - 24 = 36 questions
- Since the rest are equally divided as average and difficult questions, we have 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Now, let's find out how many questions Aries is sure to get from each category:
- Easy questions: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 's' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'l'. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation: s = 2l.

2. We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

3. The total amount earned from the sales is $120. We can write an equation based on the total earnings: 4s + 12l = 120.

4. Since s = 2l (from step 1), we can substitute this into the equation from step 3: 4(2l) + 12l = 120.

5. Simplifying the equation: 8l + 12l = 120, which gives us 20l = 120.

6. Solving for l: l = 120 / 20 = 6.

7. Since s = 2l (from step 1), we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold: s = 2 * 6 = 12.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 2 * 12 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Next, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. Since he can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 24 + (0.5 * 24) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. Since one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days with steel pickaxes. Since they can mine 1440 pounds of ore per day, they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore in 30 days.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The ratio for the first package is 3/2, and for the second package is 6/4. We can simplify these ratios to 3/2 and 3/2, respectively. This indicates that the price per sandwich is constant across the first two packages.

Now, we can use the ratio to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches. The ratio of the number of sandwiches in the third package to the first package is 8/2 = 4. Since the price per sandwich is constant, we can multiply the price of the first package by 4 to find the price of the third package.

The price of the first package is $3, so the price of the third package is 3 * 4 = $12.

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we need to calculate 10% of $2000.

10% of $2000 = 0.1 x $2000 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 * 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6. So, 6 yellow balloons were released, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's calculate the total number of balloons Sally had before adding the blue balloons: 15 red balloons + 7 green balloons + 6 yellow balloons = 28 balloons.

Adding the 6 blue balloons, Sally had 28 + 6 = 34 balloons.

"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability of the complement of the event that he won't have to turn it in. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). 

However, the last scenario is dependent on the first two not happening. So, we need to find the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not convincing her, which is 60% (100% - 40%) * 80% (100% - 20%). 

Now, we can find the total probability of the first two scenarios happening: 50% + 40% = 90%. 

The probability of the last scenario is 60% * 20% = 12%. 

Now, we add the probabilities of the first two scenarios and the last scenario: 90% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since probabilities cannot exceed 100%. This is because we've counted the scenario where the normal teacher gives everyone an extension and Marcus convinces her as part of the first two scenarios. 

So, we need to subtract the probability of this scenario from the total probability of the first two scenarios: 90% - 40% = 50%. 

Now, we add the probability of the last scenario to this: 50% + 12% = 62%. 

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 100% - 62% = 38%.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the number of small beans and the number of large beans. 

First, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. This means that the number of small beans is 3 times the number of medium beans.

Since Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, the number of medium beans is 2 times the number of large beans. 

Let's denote the number of large beans as L. Then the number of medium beans is 2L, and the number of small beans is 3(2L) = 6L.

We are given that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up. So, L = 75.

Now, we can find the number of small beans by substituting L = 75 into the equation for the number of small beans: 6L = 6(75) = 450.

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to go to 7 more bottles (8 total bottles - 1 = 7).

Now, let's find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains. It will take him 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next.

Total time = Number of bottles - 1 (since he starts at the first bottle) * Time to go from one bottle to the next
Total time = 7 * 5
Total time = 35

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how many packs Uncle Franky can make, we need to first find out how many apples he has in total. Since he ordered two boxes and each box has 40 apples, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box.

Total apples = 2 boxes * 40 apples/box = 80 apples

Next, we need to find out how many packs he can make with 80 apples. Since each pack has 8 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack.

Number of packs = Total apples / apples per pack = 80 / 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract it from the initial amount of money she had.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor starts with $50, so after buying the cheese, she will have $50 - $40 = $10 left.

The final answer is: $10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and not working while in college. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of loans he took out: 
4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money he lost by not working while in college. 
He made $25,000/year before college, so for 4 years, he would have made:
4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he lost:
$200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000

After graduating, his income triples, so he now makes $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

To find out how long it will take him to earn the money he lost, we can divide the total amount of money he lost by his new income:
$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. 

The fabric pieces need to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. So, the length of the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet and the width will be 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

Now, we can calculate the area of one fabric piece by multiplying the length and width: 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two fabric pieces, we multiply the area of one piece by 2: 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
17 more than one-fifth of 425 is 85 + 17 = 102. 
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 
5 more than twice as many as Tuesday is 204 + 5 = 209. 
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add up the number of letters delivered each day: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The final answer is: 736"
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.
The cost of the pasta salad is 6 people * $6 per person = $36.

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad together: $65 + $36 = $101.

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101."
"To find the average amount lost, we need to calculate the total amount lost and divide it by the number of races.

1. The first loss is $5.
2. The second win is $1 more than twice the amount lost in the first race. 
   So, the second win is 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.
3. The third loss is 1.5 times the amount won in the second race.
   So, the third loss is 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
Total loss = Loss in the first race + Loss in the third race - Win in the second race
Total loss = $5 + $16.50 - $11
Total loss = $10.50

There were 3 races. To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races:
Average loss = Total loss / Number of races
Average loss = $10.50 / 3
Average loss = $3.50

The final answer is: $3.50"
"To find the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities per country and then multiply that by the population of each city.

Number of countries in South America: 26
Number of cities per country: 5
Population per city: 1000

First, multiply the number of countries by the number of cities per country: 
26 countries * 5 cities/country = 130 cities

Then, multiply the total number of cities by the population per city:
130 cities * 1000 people/city = 130,000 people

The final answer is: 130000"
"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we need to first calculate their current heights.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet, which is equal to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole's initial height was 50 inches and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's denote the share of the first person as x. 

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

The share of the first person is $420."
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

First, let's convert 3 weeks to days: 3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to find the fraction of a day in hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 of a day is (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we need to combine like terms and isolate x. 

First, we multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4
= 10

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2010.

The car was bought in 2007 for $20,000. 

The depreciation rate is 21% per year. 

We need to calculate the price of the car in 2008, 2009, and 2010.

In 2008, the price of the car will be 79% of the original price (100% - 21% depreciation).
Price in 2008 = $20,000 * 0.79 = $15,800

In 2009, the price of the car will be 79% of the price in 2008.
Price in 2009 = $15,800 * 0.79 = $12,502

In 2010, the price of the car will be 79% of the price in 2009.
Price in 2010 = $12,502 * 0.79 = $9,900.58

The price of the car in 2010 is $9,900.58."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to find the total number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the books are written in English, so the number of English books is 50 * 0.5 = 25.

10% of the books are written in German, so the number of German books is 50 * 0.1 = 5.

The total number of books written in English and German is 25 + 5 = 30.

Since there are 50 books in total, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20.

"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to calculate the number of people at each stop and add them up.

Initially, Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the total number of people becomes:
120 + 20 = 140

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100) board the train. So, the total number of people becomes:
140 - 50 + 100 = 190

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the total number of people becomes:
190 - 80 = 110

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"To find the total amount Alison spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks cost $8, but she had a coupon for $2 off, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

"To find the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, we need to find the area of a single tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of a single tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Next, we need to find the total number of tiles required to cover the kitchen floor. Since the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt and each tile covers 1 SqFt, we need 200 tiles.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost of each tile: 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since a twin bed has 1 set of sheets and a king size bed has 1 set of sheets, the total number of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 + 1 = 5.

Since he can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 1, which is 2. This means he can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, or 3 sets of sheets at a time.

Now, we divide the total number of sheets by the number of sheets he can wash at a time: 5 sheets / 3 sheets per load = 1.67 loads. However, since we can't have a fraction of a load, we round up to the nearest whole number. 

So, Greg does 2 loads of laundry per week.

To find out how many loads of laundry he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads per week by the number of weeks in a year: 2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads/year.

"Let's denote the time Donovan took as 'x'. Since Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, the time Betsy took is 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation as:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x is the time Donovan took, and Betsy took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's time is x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"To find the total number of pizzas left, we first need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 
They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 (by the glee club) + 32 (by the football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 (by the glee club) + 40 (by the football team) = 60 pizzas.

The number of pizzas left is 60 (total pizzas) - 46 (pizzas eaten) = 14 pizzas.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

He also wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, which is 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert 24500 cents to dollars by dividing by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

Kayla invited 25 classmates + 7 dance class girls + 13 family members = 45 people. However, 4 people said they could not come, so the total number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41.

Since the initial 20 guests are already included in the rental fee, we need to find the number of additional guests: 41 - 20 = 21.

The cost per additional guest is $6, so the total cost for the additional guests is 21 * $6 = $126.

Adding the initial rental fee of $125, the total cost of the party is $125 + $126 = $251.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat each day. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys in total, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats. However, we know that the total number of bananas is 315, and they last for a week, which is 7 days. 

So, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315 * 7 = 2205. 

Since they eat the same amount each day, we can divide 2205 by 7 to get the total number of bananas eaten each day: 2205 / 7 = 315.

Now we know that the first and second monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day. So, the third monkey eats 315 - 24 = 291 bananas each day.

"To find out how much Jenny paid for the roses, we need to determine if she bought the roses by the dozen or individually. Since she bought 15 roses, it's more cost-effective for her to buy a dozen (12 roses) and 3 individual roses.

The cost of a dozen roses is $15. 
The cost of 3 individual roses is 3 * $2 = $6.
The total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she paid with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

Jenny leaves with 16 quarters."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the total revenue from each item and then add them together.

The revenue from milkshakes is 6 * $5.50 = $33.
The revenue from burger platters is 9 * $11 = $99.
The revenue from sodas is 20 * $1.50 = $30.

Now, we add the revenues together: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To find the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time Paul needs to wait for his train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station. Since the first train leaves at 30 minutes, the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.

3. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

4. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station. Since the second train leaves at 65 minutes, the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes.

5. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

6. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. Since the third train leaves at 125 minutes, the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Now, we need to find the time Paul needs to wait for his train. Since the current time is not given, we assume it is 0 minutes. Paul needs to wait until the fourth train arrives, which is at 145 minutes. 

The total waiting time for Paul is 145 minutes.

The final answer is: 145"
"To find out how many more weeks Melanie needs to save toothpicks, we first need to determine how many toothpicks she has saved so far. 

Melanie saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she saved is 10 * 12 = 120.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total and she already has 120, she needs 200 - 120 = 80 more toothpicks.

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week. To find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks, we divide 80 by 10, which is 8.

Therefore, Melanie needs 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is:

2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so the price his friend paid is:

1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price his friend paid, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100:

Discount = ((Original Price - Price Paid) / Original Price) * 100
= ((2000 - 1800) / 2000) * 100
= (200 / 2000) * 100
= 0.10 * 100
= 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of jellyfish each spring creates per second. 

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in the given time frame. 

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, we multiply the total seconds by the number of springs:

14400 seconds * 5 springs = 72000 jellyfish

However, we need to consider that each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, so we should multiply the total number of jellyfish by the number of seconds in a second, which is 1. 

72000 jellyfish * 1 jellyfish/second * 1 second/second = 72000 jellyfish

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it. 

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180. 

Now, we add 15 to twice Binkie's score to find Frankie's score: 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To find the total distance James walked, we need to calculate the round trip distance. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back home, the total distance is 2 * 4 miles = 8 miles.

Since James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the total time taken.

Time = distance / speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

However, this is the total time taken for the round trip. We need to find the time taken to reach the store initially. Since James walked halfway to the store and then back home, the time taken to reach the store initially is half of the total time.

Time to reach the store = Total time / 2
Time to reach the store = 2 hours / 2
Time to reach the store = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total cost of buying bananas individually, we need to calculate the cost of 10 bunches of bananas with 4 bananas each. 

First, let's find the total number of bananas: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Now, let's find the cost of buying the bananas in bunches: 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

To find the amount saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sam gets x feet of the fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet. The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. To find out how much is left over, we need to subtract the total amount of fence Sam and Harry have from the total length of the fence:

100 - (20 + (20 + 60)) = 100 - 100 = 0

However, this is not the correct interpretation of the question. The question asks how much is left over for Sam, implying that the leftover is the portion that is not given to either Sam or Harry. Since the total length of the fence is 100 feet, and Sam and Harry together have 20 + (20 + 60) = 100 feet, there is no leftover fence.

However, if we interpret the question as asking how much is left over after Sam and Harry take their portions, the answer would be 0."
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to determine the rate at which it grows per year. 

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find the rate per year, we divide the total growth by the number of years: 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year.

Now that we know the rate of growth per year, we can multiply this rate by the number of years to find the total growth: 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

Let's start by finding the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:

- Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * ($500 / 2) = 45 * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the earnings from all types of bikes to find the total earnings:

Total earnings = $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find the total number of bales made by the farmer, we need to multiply the number of bales made per hour by the number of hours worked. 

Number of bales made by the farmer per hour: 5
Number of hours worked: 6

Total bales made by the farmer: 5 * 6 = 30

To find the total number of bales picked up by the truck, we need to multiply the number of bales picked up per hour by the number of hours worked.

Number of bales picked up by the truck per hour: 3
Number of hours worked: 6

Total bales picked up by the truck: 3 * 6 = 18

To find the number of bales left in the field, we need to subtract the total number of bales picked up by the truck from the total number of bales made by the farmer.

Bales left in the field: 30 - 18 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we first need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class per day. Since he has 6 periods in a day and each class is 40 minutes long, we multiply the number of periods by the length of each class:

6 periods/day * 40 minutes/period = 240 minutes/day

Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, we multiply the minutes per day by the number of days:

240 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1200 minutes/week

Next, we need to calculate the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. Since he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on each day, we first need to find his total weekly minutes. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the minutes per day by the number of days:

240 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 1680 minutes/week

Then, we find 1/16 of his weekly minutes:

1680 minutes/week * 1/16 = 105 minutes/week

Since he spends this amount on both Saturday and Sunday, we multiply by 2:

105 minutes/week * 2 = 210 minutes/week

Now, we add the minutes he spends in class to the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday:

1200 minutes/week + 210 minutes/week = 1410 minutes/week

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

1410 minutes/week / 60 = 23.5 hours/week

"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is the height of the third floor, which is 24 feet.

The height of the ball after the first bounce is 2/3 of the initial height:
(2/3) * 24 = 16 feet

The height of the ball after the second bounce is 2/3 of the height after the first bounce:
(2/3) * 16 = 10.67 feet

The final answer is: 10.67"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches. 

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10).

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"To find the original weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the 270 kilograms left after the Allosaurus ate.

First, the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which was half of what the velociraptors had. So, the velociraptors had 2 * 270 = 540 kilograms.

Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex, the T-Rex must have eaten half of the original weight of the triceratops. The velociraptors had 540 kilograms, which is half of what the T-Rex ate. So, the T-Rex ate 2 * 540 = 1080 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the original weight of the triceratops must have been 2 * 1080 = 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint to find out how many gallons are needed. After that, we can multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to get the total cost.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their area is 10 * 8 = 80 square feet each. Since there are two of them, their total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their area is 5 * 8 = 40 square feet each. Since there are two of them, their total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

The cost per gallon is $12, so the total cost is 12 * 12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so there are 3 shaken sodas and 9 unshaken sodas. Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas. The total number of sodas is 8.

The probability of Ellen's friend getting a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas: 2/8 = 0.25.

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. So, the total distance is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of days Billy helps, we first need to find the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

However, Billy takes 20% of these days off. 20% of 50 is 0.2 * 50 = 10. So, he takes 10 days off.

The number of days he helps is 50 - 10 = 40.

Since Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

The total number of people he helps is 40 * 6 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people who were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people who were present.

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses:
12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars:
20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the number of people transported from the total number of people present. However, the question does not provide the total number of people present. It only provides the number of private cars and buses. We can assume that the number of people present is equal to the number of people transported (i.e., 480 people) plus the number of people who were not transported (i.e., the people who were already inside the church). However, we do not have enough information to determine the number of people who were already inside the church.

However, if we assume that the number of people present is equal to the number of people transported, then the number of people inside the church is 0.

However, if we assume that the number of people present is greater than the number of people transported, then the number of people inside the church is the difference between the number of people present and the number of people transported.

Since we do not have enough information to determine the number of people present, we cannot provide a definitive answer. However, we can provide a range of possible answers.

If we assume that the number of people present is equal to the number of people transported, then the number of people inside the church is 0.

If we assume that the number of people present is greater than the number of people transported, then the number of people inside the church is greater than 0.

However, if we assume that the number of people present is equal to the number of people transported plus some number of people who were already inside the church, then the number of people inside the church is equal to the number of people who were already inside the church.

Since we do not have enough information to determine the number of people who were already inside the church, we cannot provide a definitive answer.

However, if we assume that the number of people who were already inside the church is 0, then the number of people inside the church is 0.

"To find Jeff's age, we need to first find Martha's age. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age. Since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, we can calculate Jeff's age by adding 10 to Martha's age.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 

First, let's convert the time into minutes: 
- 30 minutes for lunch
- 2 breaks of 15 minutes each, so 2 * 15 = 30 minutes for breaks

Total time spent per day on lunch and breaks = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Now, we multiply the time spent per day by 5 to find the total time spent after 5 days:
1 hour * 5 = 5 hours

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now that we know Micah ran 28 miles, we can subtract the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles run by all three to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Total miles run by Amber and Micah = 8 + 28 = 36 miles
Total miles run by all three = 52 miles
Ahito's miles = Total miles run by all three - Total miles run by Amber and Micah
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16 miles

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after returning the $15.00 item and then add that to the initial charge.

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. Return: -$15.00 (since she returned an item)
   New balance: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

3. Frying pan: 20% off $20.00
   Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
   Price of frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

4. Towels: 10% off $30.00
   Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
   Price of towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

5. Total cost of new purchases: $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

6. New balance on credit card: $70.00 (previous balance) + $43.00 (new purchases) = $113.00

"Let's break down the information given:

1. A fifth of the jellyfish are large.
2. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
3. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue.
4. When a UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.

From point 2, we know that 1/3 of the large jellyfish change color. This means 2/3 of the large jellyfish do not change color. Since the jellyfish that do not change color are small, we can conclude that 2/3 of the large jellyfish are small.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. Then, the number of large jellyfish is x/5, and the number of small jellyfish is 4x/5 (since 4/5 of the jellyfish are small).

We know that 2/3 of the large jellyfish are small, so we can set up the equation:

(2/3)(x/5) = 4x/5

Simplifying the equation:

(2x/15) = 4x/5

Multiplying both sides by 15 to eliminate the fraction:

2x = 12x

Subtracting 12x from both sides:

-10x = 0

Dividing both sides by -10:

x = 0

However, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as it implies there are no jellyfish in the tank. Let's re-examine the problem.

From point 4, we know that 6 jellyfish changed color. Since these jellyfish are large and change color, we can set up the equation:

(1/3)(x/5) = 6

Simplifying the equation:

(x/15) = 6

Multiplying both sides by 15:

x = 90

The final answer is: 90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to first find Ben's age, and then multiply it by 3.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for her retirement. 

First, let's calculate her annual expenses during retirement. 40% of her current annual salary is 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000.

Since she plans to live for 20 years, her total expenses during retirement will be 20 * $40,000 = $800,000.

Now, let's calculate how much she needs to save each year. Since she's saving 20% of her salary, her annual savings will be 0.2 * $100,000 = $20,000.

However, this is not enough to cover her retirement expenses. We need to calculate how many years she needs to work to save enough money. 

Let's assume she works for 'x' years. The total amount she saves will be $20,000 * x.

Since she needs to save $800,000 for retirement, we can set up the equation:

$20,000 * x = $800,000

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by $20,000:

x = $800,000 / $20,000
x = 40

However, this is the number of years she needs to work to save enough money, but it doesn't take into account the fact that she'll be living on 40% of her salary during retirement. To account for this, we need to calculate how much she'll be saving each year in terms of her retirement income.

Her retirement income will be 40% of her current salary, which is $40,000. 

Since she's saving 20% of her current salary, her savings rate in terms of her retirement income will be (20/100) / (40/100) = 0.5 or 50% of her retirement income.

Now, let's calculate how much she needs to save each year in terms of her retirement income:

$20,000 / $40,000 = 0.5 or 50% of her retirement income

Since she needs to save 50% of her retirement income each year, and she plans to live for 20 years, we can set up the equation:

$40,000 * 0.5 * 20 = $800,000

However, this is the same as before, and it still doesn't take into account the fact that she'll be working for 'x' years. To account for this, we can set up the equation:

$40,000 * 0.5 * x = $800,000

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by ($40,000 * 0.5):

x = $800,000 / ($40,000 * 0.5)
x = $800,000 / $20,000
x = 40

However, this is the same as before, and it still doesn't take into account the fact that she'll be working for 'x' years. To account for this, we can set up the equation:

$20,000 * x = $800,000

However, this equation is the same as before, and it still doesn't take into account the fact that she'll be working for 'x' years. To account for this, we can set up the equation:

"To find the total population of the school, we can use the information given about the boys. Since 40% of the school population is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

40% of x = 240

To find x, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.4x = 240

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total population of the school is 600 students.

Since 40% of the school population is boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. We can find the number of girls by multiplying the total population by 0.6:

Number of girls = 0.6 * 600
Number of girls = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to add the cost of the pots and the garden soil, then subtract the discount.

"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide it by the total number of women.

The three women wearing 4-inch heels have a total height of 3 x 4 = 12 inches.
The three women wearing 2-inch heels have a total height of 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.
There are 6 women in total.

The average height of heels at the party is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To find out how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days she has for hiking in June. June has 30 days.

Since she wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can calculate her daily target as follows:

Total miles / Total days = Daily target
9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since she plans to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, we can calculate her current daily hiking distance as follows:

Current daily hiking distance = 2 * 125 miles
Current daily hiking distance = 250 miles

Now, we can find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike by subtracting her current daily hiking distance from her daily target:

More miles per day = Daily target - Current daily hiking distance
More miles per day = 310 miles - 250 miles
More miles per day = 60 miles

Raymond initially had $21. He saved $11, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.

He spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so the total amount he spent is $5 + $19 = $24.

Now, we subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he had: $32 - $24 = $8.

So, Raymond has $8 left.

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine how much money Anna spent on the books. Since she had a budget of $16 and has $2 left, she spent $16 - $2 = $14 on the books.

Since Anna bought 2 books and they cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount spent ($14) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

Cost of each book = Total amount spent / Number of books
Cost of each book = $14 / 2
Cost of each book = $7

"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first find the rate at which the light blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the rate per minute, we divide the number of blinks by the number of minutes: 

255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now that we know the rate per minute, we can find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate per minute:

459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes.

Additional male goldfishes: 2
Total male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5

Initial female goldfishes: 5
Additional female goldfishes: 3
Total female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's find the total number of male and female fishes:
Total male fishes: 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfishes) = 11
Total female fishes: 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfishes) = 16

To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:
Difference = Total female fishes - Total male fishes
Difference = 16 - 11
Difference = 5

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, let's add the time each person took to do their chores: 
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance John drives in a round trip, we need to calculate the distance of a one-way trip and multiply it by 2.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles (one way)

Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Total Distance = 140 miles * 2
Total Distance = 280 miles

John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the total distance by 2:
Total Monthly Distance = 280 miles * 2
Total Monthly Distance = 560 miles

"To find the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers, we first need to find the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour and the 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour produce a total of 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour produce a total of 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour.

The total number of toys produced by these 4 workers per hour is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since they work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by these 4 workers is 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

The total number of toys needed is 400, and 200 toys were produced, so the manufacturer still needs 400 - 200 = 200 toys to be able to ship the order.

However, the problem states that the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys, not 200. This means that the 5th worker must have produced 200 - 20 = 180 toys in 10 hours.

To find the number of toys the 5th worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the 5th worker by the number of hours worked: 180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour.

"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we first need to find the weight of each of his dogs. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/4 to find the weight of Elijah's first dog: 60 * 1/4 = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/2 to find the weight of Elijah's second dog: 60 * 1/2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's two dogs to find the total weight of his dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs: 60 + 45 = 105 pounds.

Kris had 7 stickers left after giving some to Rob. Before that, Kris had 7 + 9 = 16 stickers.

Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris, so Kris had 16 stickers that Luis gave him. Before that, Luis had 16 + 7 = 23 stickers.

Luis used half of the stickers that Seth gave him, so Seth gave Luis 23 * 2 = 46 stickers.

Therefore, Seth had 46 stickers in the beginning.

"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to multiply the number of large bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that by the number of M&M's per ounce. 

First, we multiply the number of large bags by the weight of each bag: 3 bags * 10 ounces = 30 ounces.

Then, we multiply the total ounces by the number of M&M's per ounce: 30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's.

Finally, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag to find the number of small bags: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/small bag = 90 small bags.

"To find Vince's current age, we first need to find Liam's age two years ago. Since Liam is 16 now, two years ago he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince, so we can set up the equation: 14 = 2 * Vince's age two years ago.

To find Vince's age two years ago, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: Vince's age two years ago = 14 / 2 = 7.

Since Vince's age two years ago was 7, we need to add 2 to find his current age: Vince's current age = 7 + 2 = 9.

3. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56, so we can write the equation: A + A + (S + 12) + S = 56
4. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2A + 2S + 12 = 56
5. Subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation, we get: 2A + 2S = 44
6. Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get: A + S = 22
7. We know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so we can write the equation: S + (S + 12) = 30
8. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2S + 12 = 30
9. Subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation, we get: 2S = 18
10. Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get: S = 9
11. Now that we know S, we can find A by substituting S into the equation A + S = 22: A + 9 = 22
12. Subtracting 9 from both sides of the equation, we get: A = 13
13. Now that we know A, we can find the number of eggs Camden painted by adding 12 to S: Camden = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21
14. The question asks how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, so we subtract A from Camden: 21 - 13 = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total number of boxes and the total weight of the crayons and boxes.

Since each box can hold 8 crayons and Nik has 200 crayons, we can divide 200 by 8 to find the number of boxes: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces and there are 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is 8 * 25 = 200 ounces.

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and Nik has 200 crayons, so the total weight of the crayons is 1 * 200 = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and boxes is 200 ounces (boxes) + 200 ounces (crayons) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, we can divide 400 by 16 to find the total weight in pounds: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to calculate 80% of 80 feet. 

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet long, we need to divide the total length of the usable tree by the length of each log.

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each log, John cuts 5 planks. So, the total number of planks is:

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

John sells each plank for $1.2. To find the total amount he makes, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank:

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Valerie earns $5000 per month.
2. Valerie's brother earns 2 times what Valerie earns, so her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.
3. Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.
4. Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so their mother earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.
5. To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to add their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach and the sidewalk. 

Let's denote the speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she spends 40 minutes on the beach, and the distance covered on the beach is 2 miles. So, we can use the formula: distance = speed * time. 

For the beach: 2 = x * 40
x = 2 / 40
x = 1/20 miles per minute

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

Now, we need to find the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. 
Time = distance / speed
Time = 1 / (1/10)
Time = 10 minutes

Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, and it takes her 10 minutes, we can find the total time it takes for her to walk the entire 3-mile walk by adding the time spent on the beach (40 minutes) and the time spent on the sidewalk (10 minutes).

Total time = 40 + 10 = 50 minutes

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach her goal of $60. This is 60 - 32 = $28.

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the amount she needs to save ($28) by the amount she saves per week ($4) to find out how many more weeks it will take her to reach her goal. 

28 / 4 = 7

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60. 

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each group of trees and then add them together.

First, we have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 3 x 7 = 21.

Next, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 2 x 4 = 8.

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, we add the number of blue birds in each group together: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24. 

So, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This means that before receiving the 24 marbles, he had 60 - 24 = 36 marbles.

Now, if he loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle. 

Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the two temperatures multiplied by the total ounces. 

The total ounces after pouring is 5 ounces. 

The average temperature is (33 + x) / 2. 

The total temperature is 5 * ((33 + x) / 2).

Since Donny can now drink the water, the total temperature must be at least 40 degrees.

5 * ((33 + x) / 2) â‰¥ 40

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

5(33 + x) â‰¥ 80

Distribute the 5:

165 + 5x â‰¥ 80

Subtract 165 from both sides:

5x â‰¥ -85

Divide both sides by 5:

x â‰¥ -17

Since temperature cannot be negative, the minimum temperature of the second bottle is 40 degrees."
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = 50 cows (initial) + 420 cows (added) = 470 cows

Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = 20 chickens (initial) + 210 chickens (added) = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
= 470 cows + 230 chickens
= 700 animals

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the total cost of the bagels, we need to first calculate the original price of 4 packs of bagels. 

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs will cost 4 x $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00 to find the discount amount. 

10% of $40.00 = 0.10 x $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the discounted price. 

Discounted price = Original price - Discount
= $40.00 - $4.00
= $36.00.

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, and Russell ordered 4 packs, the total number of bagels is 9 x 4 = 36.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the discounted price by the total number of bagels.

Cost per bagel = Discounted price / Total number of bagels
= $36.00 / 36
= $1.00.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we first need to determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes he ate. 

Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
So, the number of scoops Gomer ate is 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. 
It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
To find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops: 3 / 2 = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

Now, we can find out how many potatoes Gomer ate by multiplying the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop: 18 * 1.5 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens: 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to find the total number of red jellybeans. We know that there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans. 

So, the number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34.

We also know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can find the total number of green and red jellybeans by adding the number of green and red jellybeans.

Total green and red jellybeans = 17 (green) + 34 (red) = 51.

Now, we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total jellybeans - Total green and red jellybeans
= 60 - 51
= 9

"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the total number of lemons he gets in a year and then multiply it by 10 (since a decade has 10 years).

First, let's find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a year:

Number of trees: 5
Number of lemons per tree per year: 6

Total lemons per year = Number of trees * Number of lemons per tree per year
Total lemons per year = 5 * 6
Total lemons per year = 30

Now, let's find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade:

Total lemons in a decade = Total lemons per year * 10
Total lemons in a decade = 30 * 10
Total lemons in a decade = 300

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

Given that the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can let the number of men be 5x and the number of women be 9x. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation: 5x + 9x = 84

Combine like terms: 14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14: x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the initial number of women: 9x = 9 * 6 = 54

Since 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women who remained is: 54 - 20 = 34

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first determine how many sunflowers were sold in a day and then multiply that by 3.

Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers per day. Since each sunflower costs $2, we can find the number of sunflowers sold per day by dividing the total earnings from sunflowers by the cost of each sunflower.

Number of sunflowers sold per day = Total earnings from sunflowers / Cost of each sunflower
= $26 / $2
= 13

Now, we know that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers and Faraday earned $56 from the bouquets per day. We can find the number of bouquets sold per day by dividing the total earnings from bouquets by the cost of each bouquet.

Number of bouquets sold per day = Total earnings from bouquets / Cost of each bouquet
= $56 / $8
= 7

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:

Total sunflowers in bouquets sold per day = Number of bouquets sold per day * Number of sunflowers in each bouquet
= 7 * 12
= 84

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold per day by adding the number of sunflowers sold individually and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold.

Total sunflowers sold per day = Number of sunflowers sold per day + Total sunflowers in bouquets sold per day
= 13 + 84
= 97

Finally, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days by multiplying the total number of sunflowers sold per day by 3.

Total sunflowers sold in 3 days = Total sunflowers sold per day * 3
= 97 * 3
= 291

"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference between the two.

First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide $100 by $5:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Now, Adam sells 60% of his inventory, which is 60% of 20 rocks:

60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

Since Adam sells each rock for $7, the total revenue from selling 12 rocks is:

12 rocks * $7/rock = $84

Now, let's find the total cost of the rocks Adam bought:

20 rocks * $5/rock = $100

Since Adam only sells 12 rocks, he still has 8 rocks left, which he didn't sell. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

8 rocks * $5/rock = $40

The total cost of the rocks Adam bought is the sum of the cost of the rocks he sold and the cost of the rocks he didn't sell:

$100 (total cost) = $84 (cost of rocks sold) + $16 (cost of rocks not sold)

However, we need to find the cost of the rocks he didn't sell to calculate the loss. The cost of the rocks he didn't sell is $40.

The total revenue is $84, and the total cost is $100. The loss is the difference between the total cost and the total revenue:

Loss = Total Cost - Total Revenue
Loss = $100 - $84
Loss = $16

However, the question asks for the loss, but the loss is actually the cost of the rocks he didn't sell, which is $40."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of large, medium, and small-sized picture scenes Lauren needs to draw. 

First, let's find the LCM of 45, 36, and 49. 

The prime factorization of 45 is 3^2 * 5.
The prime factorization of 36 is 2^2 * 3^2.
The prime factorization of 49 is 7^2.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
LCM(45, 36, 49) = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5 * 7^2 = 4 * 9 * 5 * 49 = 8820.

Now, let's find out how many days it will take Lauren to draw each type of picture scene:
- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

The day count for each type of scene is not the same, so we need to find the maximum day count among them. The maximum day count is 9 days.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.2. 

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 times the probability of the first ticket: 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. 
   Let's denote the number of seashells Carlos collected as C. Then, Jim collected C + 5 seashells.
   Since Jim collected 27 seashells, we can write the equation: C + 5 = 27.
   Solving for C, we get C = 22.

2. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. 
   Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as R. Then, Carlos collected 2R seashells.
   We already know that Carlos collected 22 seashells, so we can write the equation: 2R = 22.
   Solving for R, we get R = 11.

Now, we know that Jim collected 27 seashells, Carlos collected 22 seashells, and Carrey collected 11 seashells. 
The total number of seashells is 27 + 22 + 11 = 60.

They decided to divide the seashells equally among themselves.

"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). 
So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. 
So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week.
Total carrots eaten in a week = 20 (weekdays) + 10 (weekend) = 30.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Since each juice can cover 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of 1 person's daily energy demand, Hortex would need 100 / 20 = 5 bottles.

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the number of bottles it can produce from the total number of bottles required:

11500 - 4200 = 7300

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Since Carla has 8 babies and 3/4 of them wear purple, the number of babies wearing purple is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

Now, 1/4 of the babies wear blue, so the number of babies wearing blue is 1/4 * 8 = 2.

The number of babies wearing blue and bows is 2. 

The number of babies wearing purple and bows is 1/3 of the purple wearers, which is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

Now, the total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of the number of babies wearing blue and bows and the number of babies wearing purple and bows, which is 2 + 2 = 4.

The percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is the number of babies wearing purple and bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, multiplied by 100.

"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. 

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. 

Now, we need to find out how much land is left. He sold 40 + 20 = 60 square meters, so he has 80 - 60 = 20 square meters left.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to find the size of the third apartment complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so their combined size is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400.

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. Adding this to 400 gives 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now we know the total number of apartments is 640. John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects from 640 * 3 = 1920 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 1920 * $0.40 = $768.

The final answer is: $768"
"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

- Year 1: 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
- Year 2: 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- Year 3: 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- Year 4: The tree is 8 years old, but the problem doesn't give us the production for this year. However, it tells us that an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, a 10-year-old tree produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. Therefore, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
- Year 5: The tree is 9 years old, but the problem states that it doesn't produce any fruit in the ninth year.
- Year 6: The tree is 10 years old, and we already know it produces 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up the fruits produced in the years where the tree actually produced fruits: 
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 = 1350

The final answer is: 1350"
"To find out how much money Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of Sophia's $100 and add it to Jack's initial $100.

1/5 of $100 is calculated as: $100 * (1/5) = $20

Now, we add this amount to Jack's initial $100: $100 + $20 = $120

So, Jack now has $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. 

We are given that R = 4B and B = Y - 7. 

We can express R in terms of Y: R = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28.

We are also given that R + B + Y = 37. Substituting the expressions for R and B in terms of Y, we get (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37.

Combine like terms: 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides: 6Y = 72.

Divide by 6: Y = 12.

Now that we have the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope: B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5.

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope: R = 4B = 4(5) = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume Ronnie was given x dollars initially. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3x dollars.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Ronnie is left with x - y dollars and Rissa is left with 3x - y dollars, where y is the amount they each gave to their little sister.

We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

3x - y = (4/5)(3x)

To solve for y, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

15x - 5y = 12x

Now, we can isolate y by subtracting 12x from both sides:

15x - 12x - 5y = 12x - 12x
3x - 5y = 0

Now, we can add 5y to both sides:

3x = 5y

Now, we can divide both sides by 5:

(3/5)x = y

Now, we can substitute this expression for y into the equation for Ronnie's remaining money:

x - y = x - (3/5)x
x - (3/5)x = x - (3/5)x
(2/5)x = x - (3/5)x

Now, we can add (3/5)x to both sides:

(2/5)x + (3/5)x = x
(5/5)x = x

Now, we can simplify the left-hand side:

x = x

This equation is true for any value of x, so we can choose a value for x to find the amount of money Ronnie has left. Let's choose x = 5.

Now, we can substitute x = 5 into the expression for Ronnie's remaining money:

(2/5)x = (2/5)(5)
(2/5)(5) = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the information given:

- There are four colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow.
- There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
- Half the mural is yellow.
- The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is the combination of red, white, and purple paint. Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as x. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the total amount of these three colors is 3x.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow. So, the other half is 6 pints (since 12 / 2 = 6). This 6 pints is the combination of red, white, and purple paint, which is 3x.

We can set up the equation: 3x = 6

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 6 / 3
x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and we know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, and then add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house to get the total area of the house: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

The final answer is: 3160"
"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and add them up.

On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
On Tuesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 3 * 2 = 6 clouds.
On Wednesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she counts double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds for each day:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box for $1, we first need to determine how many pods are in the new box. 

The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. 20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. So, the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with the new box for $12. Since the new box costs $12 and you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 120 cycles with the new box for $12.

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the total number of cycles by 12. 

120 cycles / 12 = 10 cycles per dollar.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of bills he has is 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he is left with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which means he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is $20, tripling his money means he now has 3 * 20 = $60 per bill. The number of bills remains the same, so he now has 20 * 60 = $1200.

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find the number of 5 dollar bills, we divide the total amount of money by 5: 1200 / 5 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.

Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored in the match. In the first half, team A scored 4 goals and team B scored 2 goals. In the second half, team A scored 2 goals and team B scored 8 goals.

Total goals scored by team A = 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Total goals scored by team B = 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

Total goals scored in the match = 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to determine how many days he can use the chalk after Monday.

Initially, the teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk, which is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches. 

Now, the remaining chalk is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days he can use the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's set up an equation to find the number of days (x):

2.75 = 5 * (1 - 0.20)^x

Simplifying the equation:

2.75 = 5 * (0.80)^x

Divide both sides by 5:

0.55 = (0.80)^x

Now, we need to solve for x. We can use logarithms to do this:

log(0.55) = x * log(0.80)

x = log(0.55) / log(0.80)

Using a calculator to find the values of the logarithms:

x â‰ˆ 3.04

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number.

"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to find the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4. 
One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

Since there are 24 students in total (12 boys and 12 girls), the number of students not on varsity is 24 - 7 = 17.

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to first determine the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the number of teeth capped is 4 + 7 = 11. 

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15. 

To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100. 

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

20 = C

Colin is 20 years old now.

"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza her friends will eat. 

For cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is 6 friends * 6 slices/friend = 36 slices. 

For pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 6 friends * 4 slices/friend = 24 slices.

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find out how many whole pizzas are needed for each type. 

For cheese pizza, 36 slices / 12 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas. 

For pepperoni pizza, 24 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, she needs a total of 3 + 3 = 6 pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many snowballs Jay builds per minute and how many melt per minute, and then calculate the net change in the number of snowballs per minute.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 60 minutes, so he builds 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

Jay loses 2 snowballs every 15 minutes, so he loses 2/15 snowballs per minute.

The net change in the number of snowballs per minute is (1/3) - (2/15) = (5/15) - (2/15) = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay starts with 0 snowballs, we need to find out how many minutes it will take to build 60 snowballs. 

Let's set up an equation: 

0 + (1/5)t = 60

To solve for t, we multiply both sides by 5:

5(0 + (1/5)t) = 5(60)
0 + t = 300
t = 300

So, it will take Jay 300 minutes to build 60 snowballs.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the remaining bandages after the first day are x - 38 + 50.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The remaining bandages after the second day are (x - 38 + 50) - 28.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they had 100 bandages added. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The remaining bandages after the third day are ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) + 100 - 25.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78

Simplifying the equation:

x - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78

"To find Jen's total earnings, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total attendance bonus.

Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, we need to find the total number of days she worked in April. 

4 weeks * 7 days/week = 28 days

Since Jen works 6 days a week, she worked 28 days * 6 days/week = 168 days in April.

However, we are given that she works 7.5 hours a day, so we need to find the total hours she worked in April.

168 days * 7.5 hours/day = 1260 hours

"To find the total cost, we first need to determine the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $600 / 10 = $60 per bottle.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $60 + $30 = $90 per bottle.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

- On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, so he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day.
- On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total number of White Oak trees is 20 + 10 = 30.
- He planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days:

Total White Oak trees = 20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 30
Total Lodgepole Pine trees = 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

Total number of trees = Total White Oak trees + Total Lodgepole Pine trees = 30 + 90 = 120

So, each person got approximately 2.67 gallons of root beer to drink during the party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let x be the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The problem states that ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8.

We are also given that this expression is equal to 40, so we can set up the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we need to calculate one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

Now, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. Since 22 fish have red stripes, the remaining fish are 66 - 22 = 44.

Next, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes, which is 5/11 of the remaining fish. 

5/11 of 44 is (5/11) * 44 = 20.

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes. We add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes. 

22 (red stripes) + 20 (blue stripes) = 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"Amy initially had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes. 

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 eyeshadow colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which had 4 colors, so Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors.

Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 eyeshadow colors.

Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors and used up 3 eyeshadow colors, so she lost a total of 4 + 3 = 7 eyeshadow colors.

Amy initially had 26 eyeshadow colors and lost 7 eyeshadow colors, so she has 26 - 7 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the information given.

1. Mattison's height: 60 inches
2. The two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison: 7 * 60 = 420 inches
3. The first floor's floor to ceiling height is thrice as high as Mattison: 3 * 60 = 180 inches

Since the two-story house is 420 inches high, and the first floor's floor to ceiling height is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the same as the height of the second floor, which is 240 inches.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the number of shells found by team Alphas, we need to calculate 40% of 700. 

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found their share. 

Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
= 700 - 280
= 420 shells.

Next, we need to find the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters. 

Shells found by Gogetters = Total shells - (Shells found by Alphas + Shells found by The finders)
= 700 - (280 + 252)
= 700 - 532
= 168 shells.

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we need to first calculate the total miles walked by the first three dogs and then subtract that from the total average miles walked by all four dogs.

The first dog needs to walk 1 mile, the second needs to walk 4 miles, and the third needs to walk 3 miles. 

Total miles walked by the first three dogs = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles

The average miles walked by all four dogs is 3 miles. 

Total miles walked by all four dogs = Average miles * Number of dogs
Total miles walked by all four dogs = 3 * 4 = 12 miles

Now, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs to find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk.

Miles walked by the last dog = Total miles walked by all four dogs - Total miles walked by the first three dogs
Miles walked by the last dog = 12 - 8
Miles walked by the last dog = 4

"To find out how much money John got from the loan, we need to calculate 40% of the value of his house. 

40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

Now, John uses 60% of this amount to pay off his debts. 

60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

This means John paid off $60,000 of his debt. To find out how much money he has leftover, we subtract this amount from the loan amount.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

So, John has $40,000 leftover after paying off his debt.

"To find the total weight of the tunas caught, we need to add the weights of all three tunas. 

Weight of the first tuna = 56 kilograms
Weight of the second tuna = 46 kilograms
Weight of the last tuna = 26 kilograms

Total weight of the tunas = 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Total weight of the tunas * Cost per kilogram
Total earnings = 128 * 0.50
Total earnings = 64

"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The cost price of the magazines is $72. Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them. 

To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 11/8: 
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = (11 * 72) / 8
Selling price = 792 / 8
Selling price = 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed on each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total water removed on the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total water removed on the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Brian ran it for 5 days, so the total water removed on the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total water removed on each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people.

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first stop, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, the bus has 200 - 180 = 20 spaces left.

"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for the first 5 years and the cost of visits for the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5. The annual cost is 3 * $5 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

The total cost for all visits is $30 + $45 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups required and then multiply that by the time it takes for each group to try the escape room.

There are 4 grades (4-7) with 10 students in each grade, so the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only the top 10 students in each grade get to try the escape room, the total number of students trying the escape room is 4 * 10 = 40.

However, only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group: 40 / 8 = 5.

Since each group uses their full 45 minutes, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is the number of groups multiplied by the time per group: 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the tables and the total cost of the roof frames, and then add them together.

The cost of the tables is 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.
The cost of the roof frames is 2 frames * $10 per frame = $20.

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames together: $80 + $20 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet, we can find the length of the longer piece by multiplying x by 4:

4x = 4(8) = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we can find out how much seasoning he needs. He adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat.

Total pounds of meat needed = 5
Seasoning per pound = 2 tablespoons

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the width of one window by the number of windows. 

Width of one window = 35 inches
Number of windows = 5

Total width of windows = 35 inches/window * 5 windows = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the total width by 2.

Fabric needed = 2 * 175 inches = 350 inches

"To find the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we need to calculate the amount of rain that fell on Monday and then add the amount of rain expected on Tuesday.

The amount of rain on Monday is given as 2 inches.

The amount of rain expected on Tuesday is 1 more inch than twice the amount of rain on Monday. 
Twice the amount of rain on Monday is 2 * 2 = 4 inches.
1 more inch than twice the amount of rain on Monday is 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

So, the total inches of rain on Tuesday will be 5 inches.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. 
   Let's represent the number of cupcakes as 'c'. Then, the number of brownies can be represented as 3c - 2.

2. Each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. 
   So, the total number of treats given out is 2 * 5 = 10.

3. The total number of treats (cupcakes + brownies) is equal to 10. 
   We can write this as an equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

4. Now, let's solve the equation for 'c'. 
   Combine like terms: c + 3c - 2 = 10
   Simplify: 4c - 2 = 10
   Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12
   Divide by 4: c = 3

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount, and then add the cost of the nail art.

The original cost of the manicure and pedicure is $35 + $40 = $75.

The discount is 20% of $75, which is 0.2 x $75 = $15.

So, the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers in total (5 on each hand), the cost of the nail art is 10 x $3 = $30.

The total cost is the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of the nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them up.

The first 3 magazines send 12 issues a year, so the total number of issues from these magazines is 3 * 12 = 36.

The second magazine sends 6 issues a year.

The third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues a year.

Now, let's add up the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan receives a total of 66 magazines every year."
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley.
2. Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim.
3. Samantha has 27 paintings.

From point 1, we can express the relationship between Samantha and Shelley's paintings as: 
Samantha's paintings = Shelley's paintings - 12

Since Samantha has 27 paintings, we can substitute this value into the equation:
27 = Shelley's paintings - 12

To find Shelley's paintings, we add 12 to both sides of the equation:
Shelley's paintings = 27 + 12
Shelley's paintings = 39

Now that we know Shelley has 39 paintings, we can use point 2 to find Kim's paintings:
Shelley's paintings = Kim's paintings + 8
39 = Kim's paintings + 8

To find Kim's paintings, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
Kim's paintings = 39 - 8
Kim's paintings = 31

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to calculate the price after each discount.

Initially, the price of the toy is $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we multiply the initial price by 1.8 (100% + 80% = 180%, or 1 + 0.8 = 1.8).

Price in December = $40 * 1.8 = $72

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we multiply the price in December by 0.5 (100% - 50% = 50%, or 1 - 0.5 = 0.5).

Price in January = $72 * 0.5 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the standard lessons and the reduced-rate lessons separately and then add them together.

For the standard lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. So, the total amount from standard lessons is 4 * $80 = $320.

For the reduced-rate lessons, Charlie has 2 lessons at a 25% discount. The reduced rate is 75% of the standard rate, which is 0.75 * $80 = $60 per hour. So, the total amount from reduced-rate lessons is 2 * $60 = $120.

Now, we add the total amount from standard lessons and reduced-rate lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make: $320 + $120 = $440.

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The sum of the scores is 630.

Next, we need to count the total number of scores, which is 9.

Now, we divide the sum of the scores by the total number of scores:
630 Ã· 9 = 70

The mean score is 70."
"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first determine what 1/4 of the original amount is. 

Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. 

1/4 of 20 is calculated as: 20 * (1/4) = 20 * 0.25 = 5

This means Eve was left with 5 pieces of pomelos. 

Since Eve originally had 20 pieces, the number of pomelos she gave away can be found by subtracting the number of pomelos she was left with from the original amount: 

20 - 5 = 15

So, Eve gave away 15 pieces of pomelos.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the number of apples Walter ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60. 

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. 

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

60 - 24 = 36

Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. 

25% of 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. 

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each. 

Number of apples sold = 27
Price per apple = $3
Total money received = 27 * 3 = $81

"To find the total number of novels Regina wrote this year, we need to determine the total number of novels she wrote last year and then multiply it by 4 (since 3 quarters is equivalent to 3/4, and to find the whole, we multiply by 4/3).

Let's start by setting up the equation:

9 novels = 3/4 * x

To find x, we can multiply both sides by 4/3:

9 * (4/3) = x
12 = x

So, Regina wrote 12 novels last year. However, the question asks for the number of novels she wrote this year. Since 9 novels is 3/4 of the number of novels she wrote this year, we can set up the equation:

9 = 3/4 * y

To find y, we can multiply both sides by 4/3:

9 * (4/3) = y
12 = y

However, this is the number of novels she wrote last year. To find the number of novels she wrote this year, we need to multiply 12 by 4/3:

12 * (4/3) = 16

"To find the total distance covered by Michael in 3 days, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours he traveled in 3 days. 

Since there are 24 hours in a day, Michael traveled for 3 * 24 = 72 hours. 

Now, we can multiply his average speed by the total hours to find the total distance covered: 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hr
Distance = 3600 km

Now, we can find the percentage of the distance covered by dividing the distance covered by the total distance and multiplying by 100:
Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100
Percentage = 60%

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.
3. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.
4. The remaining grapes are used by their mother to make pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the number of pies she can make is the total number of grapes remaining divided by 12.
5. Let's denote the initial number of grapes as x. The number of grapes remaining after Madeline and her brother used some is x - 36.
6. Since their mother used the remaining grapes to make pies, the number of pies she made is (x - 36) / 12.
7. We are told that their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, so we can set up the equation (x - 36) / 12 = 4.
8. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 12 to get x - 36 = 48.
9. Adding 36 to both sides of the equation gives us x = 84.

"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

The cost of pasta per week is $1.00.
The cost of cheddar cheese per week is $3.00.
The cost of gruyere cheese per week is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

The total cost of ingredients per week is $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

There are 52 weeks in a year. To find the total cost per year, multiply the weekly cost by 52:

$10.00 * 52 = $520.00

Therefore, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year."
"To find the total number of classrooms the custodian needs to clean, we already know that number is 80. 

The total time it takes to clean all the classrooms is 80 classrooms * 15 minutes per classroom = 1200 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time in hours is 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours.

The custodian works 8 hours a day for 5 days. The total hours worked is 8 hours/day * 5 days = 40 hours.

To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we need to divide the total time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of books the middle shelves can hold as 'x'. Since there are two middle shelves, the total number of books they can hold is 2x.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2x books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 2x - 5 books.

The total number of books the bookcase can hold is the sum of the books on all shelves: 2x + 2x + (2x - 5) = 6x - 5.

We know that Elly has 110 books, and we need to find out how many bookcases she needs to hold all of them. Let's denote the number of bookcases as 'n'. Then, the total number of books the bookcases can hold is n(6x - 5).

Since the total number of books is 110, we can set up the equation: n(6x - 5) = 110.

We also know that each middle shelf can hold 10 books, so x = 10.

Now we can substitute x into the equation: n(6(10) - 5) = 110.

Simplifying the equation: n(60 - 5) = 110, n(55) = 110.

Dividing both sides by 55: n = 110 / 55.

n = 2.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To find Rose's profit, we need to first calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of 5 dozens of eggs is 5 * $2.40 = $12.

Since 1 dozen has 12 eggs, 5 dozens have 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Rose will sell the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs, so the selling price per egg is $1 / 3 = $0.33.

The total revenue from selling 60 eggs is 60 * $0.33 = $20.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $20 - $12 = $8.

"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to determine how many questions she needs to get right in total to pass. 

Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct, and the total number of questions is the sum of the questions in both tests, we need to calculate the total number of questions first. The first test has 70 questions and the second test has 40 questions, so the total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110.

Now, we can calculate the total number of questions Audrey needs to get right to pass. 70% of 110 is 0.7 * 110 = 77.

We know that Audrey got 60% of the first test correct, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions. To find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get right. So, 77 - 42 = 35.

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. We are given that B = 5S - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so S + B = 116.

Substituting the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation, we get S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know S, we can find B: B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets one person to come into the dealership. So, to find out how many people he needs to come into the dealership to sell 15 cars, we need to find out how many people he needs to make 15 sales. Since for every two customers that come into the dealership, one will buy a car, we can multiply the number of sales by 2 to find the number of customers needed. 

15 sales * 2 customers/sale = 30 customers

Now, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets one person to come into the dealership. So, to find out how many telephone calls he needs to make to get 30 customers, we can multiply the number of customers needed by 25.

30 customers * 25 calls/customer = 750 calls

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, which is 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, which is 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles. 

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a day and then multiply it by the number of days in June.

Since Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day, and 1 dozen is equal to 12, he makes 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

The price of each doughnut is $2. So, the total amount of money Derrick makes in a day is 120 * $2 = $240.

June has 30 days. Therefore, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June is $240 * 30 = $7200.

The final answer is: $7200"
"To find out how many days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload per day.

The final answer is: $235.00"
"To find the new speaking speed of John, we need to multiply his original speed by 2.5. 

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can convert the new speed to words per second by dividing by 60.

New speed (words per second) = 375 WPM / 60 = 6.25 words per second

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so:

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

To find the time it takes to speak 4500 words, we can divide the total number of words by the new speaking speed in words per second.

Time = Total words / New speed (words per second) = 4500 words / 6.25 words/second = 720 seconds

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we can convert the time to minutes by dividing by 60.

Time (minutes) = 720 seconds / 60 = 12 minutes

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining days.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people on the third day is 2 * 70 = 140.

The total number of people on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 1.5 minutes is 20 + 60 = 80.
4. In the next 30 seconds, the kernels pop at four times the initial rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.
5. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 2 minutes is 80 + 80 = 160.
6. In the final 30 seconds, the kernels pop at half the rate of the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.
7. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 2.5 minutes is 160 + 40 = 200.
8. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. This is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.
9. Therefore, the total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210.

"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade he needs to make, including the extra gallon for Allen. 

Since Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade and an extra gallon for Allen, he will need to make a total of 5 gallons of lemonade.

Since 1 cup of lemon juice is required for 1 gallon of lemonade, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total amount of lemon juice needed for 5 gallons of lemonade.

5 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 5 cups of lemon juice

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of lemons needed for 5 cups of juice.

5 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 5 * 6 / 6 = 5

However, this is the number of sets of 6 lemons needed, not the total number of lemons. To find the total number of lemons, we multiply the number of sets by 6.

5 * 6 = 30

So, Tim will need 30 lemons."
"To find the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption and then multiply it by 7.

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

Initial value of the boat = $9000

Depreciation in the first year = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after the first year = Initial value - Depreciation = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Depreciation in the second year = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after the second year = Value after the first year - Depreciation = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Depreciation in the third year = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after the third year = Value after the second year - Depreciation = $4410 - $882 = $3528

"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We are given that there are 54 red candies. Since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.

We are also given that there are half as many yellow candies as red candies. The number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we know the total number of candies is 232. We can find the total number of non-pink candies by adding the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of non-pink candies from the total number of candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

Since Josh services 3 cars a day, in 10 days, he services 3 cars/day * 10 days = 30 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so in 2 weeks, he makes 30 cars * $4/car = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many cookies Randy has now, we need to track the changes in the number of cookies of each flavor.

Initially, Randy has:
- 9 oatmeal cookies
- 4 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 sugar cookies

He ate 1 of each flavor for an early day snack, so he has:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

Then, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, so he has:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 4 sugar cookies

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, so he has:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

Finally, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner, so he has:
- 6 + 4 = 10 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies Randy has:
10 (oatmeal) + 7 (chocolate chip) + 6 (sugar) = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get for the first half of the collection and the second half separately, and then add them together.

Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, we can divide them into two equal halves: 6 toy soldiers for the first half and 6 toy soldiers for the second half.

For the first half, Matthew would get $5 per toy, so the total amount for the first half would be 6 * $5 = $30.

For the second half, Matthew would get $7 per toy, so the total amount for the second half would be 6 * $7 = $42.

To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we add the amounts for the first and second halves together: $30 + $42 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then determine how many holes Nate fills in per day. 

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled in per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes.

To find out how many days it takes to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled in per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the number of weeks by dividing the total number of days by 7: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the average enrollment at Butler High School, we need to calculate 3/4 of the average enrollment at Norman High School. 

3/4 * 4000 = 3000

Now, we need to find the difference between the average enrollment at Norman High School and Butler High School.

Difference = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Number of chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The final answer is: 2325"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
2. Igor gathered two more Petri dishes than requested: 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
3. The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29.
4. The number of beakers Igor gathered was correct, so let's denote the number of beakers as B.

We can set up an equation based on the information:

8 (test tubes) + 16 (Petri dishes) + B (beakers) = 29

Combine the constants:
8 + 16 + B = 29

Simplify the equation:
24 + B = 29

Subtract 24 from both sides:
B = 5

So, Igor lost 7 beakers (7 beakers were requested, but only 5 were on the lab bench).

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to determine the number of eggs in the second basket and then add it to the number of eggs in the first basket.

Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as in the first basket, and the first basket has 10 eggs, the second basket has 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 (first basket) + 20 (second basket) = 30 eggs.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount raised by each girl and add them together.

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430. So, Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. So, Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we add the amounts raised by each girl: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron.
2. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
3. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if Vanessa runs 4 miles, Aaron would run half the distance, which is 2 miles.

Now, we know Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes. To find out how long it would take Vanessa to run 4 miles, we need to find out how long it takes her to run 1 mile. 

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, it would take Vanessa twice as long to run 2 miles as it took Aaron. So, if Aaron took 16 minutes to run 2 miles, Vanessa would take 2 * 16 = 32 minutes to run 2 miles.

Since Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, she runs 4 miles. To find out how long it takes her to run 4 miles, we multiply the time it takes her to run 2 miles by 2. 

So, 32 * 2 = 64 minutes.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line

Since he already has 6 feet of new line, we need to subtract this from the total amount of line required.

600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate their daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

Daily revenue = (2 meals * $5 per meal) + $5 bottle of wine
Daily revenue = (2 * $5) + $5
Daily revenue = $10 + $5
Daily revenue = $15

Since they are open 2 days a week, we multiply the daily revenue by 2:
Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * 2
Weekly revenue = $15 * 2
Weekly revenue = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"To find the cost of each watermelon, we first need to find the total revenue from selling all the watermelons. Since the vendor sold all the watermelons at a 25% profit, the selling price of each watermelon will be 125% of the cost price (100% of the cost price + 25% profit).

Let's assume the cost price of each watermelon is x. The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80, so we can write the equation as 50x = 80.

To find the cost of each watermelon, we divide both sides of the equation by 50: x = 80 / 50.

x = 1.6

Now that we know the cost of each watermelon, we can find the selling price of each watermelon. The selling price is 125% of the cost price, which is 1.25x.

Selling price = 1.25 * 1.6
Selling price = 2

However, the question asks for the selling price of each watermelon, but the question also asks for the answer to be in a specific format. Since the question asks for the final numerical answer, I will provide the cost of each watermelon as the answer.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then determine the age of John's youngest son.

First, let's find James' current age. We know that James is twice as old as Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that James is twice as old as 12. 

James' current age = 2 * (12 + 3) = 2 * 15 = 30

Now, we know that James is 30 years old. We also know that James is 11 years younger than John, since John was 19 when James was born. 

John's current age = James' current age + 11 = 30 + 11 = 41

John's youngest son was born when John was 32. To find the current age of John's youngest son, we subtract 32 from John's current age.

John's youngest son's current age = John's current age - 32 = 41 - 32 = 9

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 9 + 3 = 12 years old.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many oranges Ana and Jane can peel in an hour. 

Let's assume the number of oranges Ana peels is 'A' and the number of oranges Jane peels is 'J'. 

Ana peels 1 orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60/3 = 20 oranges. 
Jane peels 1 orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60/4 = 15 oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is A - J = 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor cost.

The original cost of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, so he pays 20% of the original cost. 
20% of $400 is 0.2 x $400 = $80.

The labor cost is $50 per hour for 3 hours, so the total labor cost is $50 x 3 = $150.

The total cost is the cost of the radiator plus the labor cost: $80 + $150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write the equation:

2C + 4W = 70

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 to get:

2C + 2W = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate C:

(2C + 4W) - (2C + 2W) = 70 - 40
2W = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

W = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens:

C + 15 = 20
C = 5

Therefore, the number of chickens is 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we need to find the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

There are 4 people in total, including Henry and his 3 friends. To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 / 4 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
