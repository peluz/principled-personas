"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

Now, let's subtract the eggs she used from the total number of eggs she laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. To find out how much she makes, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg: 9 * 2 = 18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we need half of 2, which is 1 bolt of white fiber.

So, the total number of bolts needed is 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

"To find the profit Josh made, we need to first find the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

Let's find the value of the repairs in terms of the original value of the house. If the original value is 100%, then the increase is 150%. So, the total value after repairs is 100% + 150% = 250% of the original value.

Since 250% is the same as 2.5 times the original value, we can multiply the original value by 2.5 to find the new value:

$80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000

Now, we know the original value of the house was $80,000 and the new value is $200,000. To find the profit, we need to subtract the original value from the new value:

Profit = New Value - Original Value
Profit = $200,000 - $80,000
Profit = $120,000

The profit Josh made is $120,000."
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 sessions a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to determine the total number of cups of feed she gives her chickens in a day. 

In the morning, she gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens 25 cups of feed. So, the total number of cups of feed she gives her chickens in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in a day is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

Now, we subtract the total number of cups of feed she gives her chickens in the morning and afternoon from the total number of cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in a day to find out how many cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day. 

60 - 40 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass. 

The sequence of the cost of the glasses is: $5, $3, $1.8, $1.08, $0.64, $0.384, $0.2304, $0.13824, $0.082944, $0.0497664, $0.02986584, $0.017929504, $0.010757904, $0.006454144, $0.0038272864, $0.002306377184, $0.0013738263104.

To find the total cost, we need to add up the cost of all the glasses. 
Total cost = $5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.64 + $0.384 + $0.2304 + $0.13824 + $0.082944 + $0.0497664 + $0.02986584 + $0.017929504 + $0.010757904 + $0.006454144 + $0.0038272864 + $0.002306377184 + $0.0013738263104
Total cost ≈ $23.999999999999996

However, we can simplify this problem by using a formula. The cost of the first glass is $5, and the cost of the second glass is 60% of $5. The cost of the third glass is 60% of the second glass, which is 60% of 60% of $5. This can be written as 0.6 * 0.6 * $5 = 0.36 * $5. 

The cost of the fourth glass is 60% of the third glass, which is 60% of 60% of 60% of $5. This can be written as 0.6 * 0.6 * 0.6 * $5 = 0.216 * $5.

We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass. This can be written as 0.6^n * $5, where n is the position of the glass.

The total cost can be written as the sum of the cost of each glass: 
Total cost = $5 + 0.6 * $5 + 0.6^2 * $5 + 0.6^3 * $5 + ... + 0.6^15 * $5

"Let's break down the information given:

- Seattle has 20 sheep.
- Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
- Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle: 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to calculate the time taken for the first part of the download, the time taken for the restart, and the time taken for the second part of the download.

First, let's find the time taken for the first part of the download. Carla can download 2 GB/minute. The file is 200 GB, so the time taken for the first part of the download is:

Time = Total size / Download speed
Time = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 100 minutes

40% of the file is 200 * 0.4 = 80 GB. Carla has already downloaded 80 GB, so she has 200 - 80 = 120 GB left to download.

Now, let's find the time taken for the second part of the download. The time taken for the second part of the download is:

Time = Total size / Download speed
Time = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 60 minutes

The time taken for the restart is given as 20 minutes.

So, the total time taken to download the file is the sum of the time taken for the first part of the download, the time taken for the restart, and the time taken for the second part of the download:

Total time = 100 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes
Total time = 180 minutes

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled in the first 3 hours and the distance he traveled in the last 4 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time

For the first 3 hours, John drove at 60 mph:
Distance = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

For the first 2 hours of the return trip, John was stuck in traffic, so he didn't move:
Distance = 0 miles

For the next half-hour, John drove at 30 mph:
Distance = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

For the remaining 2.5 hours of the return trip, John drove at 80 mph:
Distance = 80 * 2.5 = 200 miles

Now, let's add up the distances:
Total distance = 180 + 0 + 15 + 200 = 395 miles

However, since John is on his way back home, we need to subtract the distance he traveled from home to the point where he turned around (180 miles) from the total distance to find out how far he is from home:
Distance from home = Total distance - Distance traveled to the point of return
Distance from home = 395 - 180
Distance from home = 215 miles

"To find Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately, then add them together.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime pay rate is:
$10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

Her overtime earnings are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Now, we add her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

Her earnings for the week are $460.

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads from each month together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total revenue it generates each year.

The initial cost of the tree is $90. 

Each year, the tree generates revenue from selling lemons. Since the tree grows 7 lemons per year and each lemon sells for $1.5, the total revenue per year is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

However, it also costs $3 to water and feed the tree each year. So, the net revenue per year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

To find out how many years it will take for the tree to start earning money, we need to find the break-even point, which is when the total revenue equals the initial cost of the tree.

Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. The total revenue after 'x' years is $7.5x, and the total cost is $90. We want to find the smallest 'x' for which $7.5x ≥ $90.

Dividing both sides by $7.5, we get x ≥ $90 / $7.5.

x ≥ 12

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we round up to the nearest whole number. 

The final answer is: 13"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.
2. She sold 2 more at the red house.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house.
4. She has 5 vacuum cleaners left.

Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as x.

From point 1, Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she has (2/3)x left after the green house.

From point 2, she sold 2 more at the red house, so she has (2/3)x - 2 left after the red house.

From point 3, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she has ((2/3)x - 2)/2 left after the orange house.

From point 4, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

((2/3)x - 2)/2 = 5

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get:

(2/3)x - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

(2/3)x = 12

Multiply both sides by 3/2 to solve for x:

x = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students

The remaining students after contemporary dance are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

The remaining students after jazz dance are 16 - 4 = 12 students.

Since the rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 12.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the profit, we need to calculate the increase in value of each option. 

For the jewelry, the increase in value is 2.5% of $5,000, which is 0.025 * 5000 = $125. 

For the electronic gadgets, the increase in value is 1.2% of $8,000, which is 0.012 * 8000 = $96.

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, we need to choose the option with the higher increase in value. In this case, the jewelry option has a higher increase in value of $125.

However, the question asks for the profit, not the increase in value. To calculate the profit, we need to consider the original cost of the items and the increase in value. 

The profit from the jewelry option would be $125 (increase in value) - $5,000 (original cost) = -$4,875. 

The profit from the electronic gadgets option would be $96 (increase in value) - $8,000 (original cost) = -$7,904.

Since the profit from the jewelry option is higher, the merchant should choose the jewelry option. 

The final answer is: $-4875"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. 

On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance.

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
She works 35 hours a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total hours she works as a teacher in a year is 35 * 50 = 1750 hours.
Her hourly wage as a teacher is $20, so her total earnings from teaching in a year is 1750 * $20 = $35,000.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
She works 15 hours a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total hours she works as a coach in a year is 15 * 50 = 750 hours.
Her hourly wage as a coach is $30, so her total earnings from coaching in a year is 750 * $30 = $22,500.

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her annual salary:
$35,000 (teaching) + $22,500 (coaching) = $57,500.

The final answer is: $57,500."
"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in 4 weeks and then multiply it by the number of eggs she eats per day.

There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will have 4 x 7 = 28 days.

Claire eats 3 eggs per day, so in 28 days, she will eat 3 x 28 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat.

84 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 7 dozens.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total time Marissa wants to take to complete the 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

Time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours.

Since Marissa has already taken 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another hour to walk the next 2 miles, she has taken a total of 2 hours so far. 

To find the time she has left, we subtract the time she has taken from the total time: 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour.

The remaining distance is 12 miles - (4 miles + 2 miles) = 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can use the formula: speed = distance / time. 

Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. 

Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the remaining one-third is non-water. So, the non-water portion is 10 - 6.67 = 3.33 liters.

Now, to find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, we need to calculate three-fifths of 15 liters.

Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Since we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of the orange drink. The remaining amount of the orange drink is 10 - 1 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the remaining amount of the orange drink to the pineapple drink to get the total amount of the mixture. The total amount is 9 + 15 = 24 liters.

The total amount of water in the mixture is the sum of the water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink. The water in the orange drink is 6.67 liters, and the water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters. 

So, the total amount of water in the mixture is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15.67}$"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
2. Samantha is now 31 years old.
3. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.
4. Raymond had a son at the age of 23.
5. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to subtract the age at which Raymond had a son from his current age: 25 - 23 = 2.

So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago."
"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought a total of 3 * 1 = 3 DVDs.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought a total of 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold to the first 5 customers: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

Since the last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, we don't need to add anything to the total.

So, Billy sold a total of 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how many centimeters shorter the candle will be, we need to calculate the total number of hours it burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. 

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours. 

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting: 
4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price.

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since Kyle bought the book with a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of the original price, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so we can set up the equation:

x - 0.25x = 19.50

Combine like terms:

0.75x = 19.50

Now, divide both sides by 0.75 to solve for x:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she ordered excluding the pizza. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12. 
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 x $3 = $15. 
The cost of 4 apples is 4 x $1.50 = $6. 

The total cost of the items excluding the pizza is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. 

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17. 

Now, we need to find out how many boxes of pizza cost $17. Each box costs $8.50, so the number of boxes is $17 / $8.50 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 x $16.50 = $49.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 x $22.50 = $67.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 x $42 = $126.

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

The final answer is: $243"
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 cartons of ice cream for 60 days (1 serving per night for 60 nights).

Each carton has 15 servings, so to find the total number of cartons she needs, we divide 60 by 15:

60 / 15 = 4

So, Cynthia will need 4 cartons of ice cream.

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 from 60. 

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance of the first stop and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

20 miles (first stop) - 45 miles (distance from second stop to the end) is not correct, we need to find the distance from the first stop to the second stop. 

Since the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, we can find the distance from the first stop to the second stop by subtracting 15 from the distance of the first stop and then subtracting that result from the total trip distance. 

However, a simpler way to find the distance between the two stops is to subtract the distance of the first stop from the total trip distance and then subtract the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip from that result. 

60 miles (total trip) - 20 miles (first stop) = 40 miles
40 miles - 15 miles (distance from second stop to the end) = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let the cost of the cheaper pair of heels be x dollars. 
The cost of the more expensive pair of heels is 2x dollars. 
The total cost of the two pairs of heels is x + 2x = 3x dollars. 
We know that the total cost of the two pairs of heels is five dollars less than the boots, so we can write the equation: 
3x = boots - 5 

We also know that one pair of heels costs $33, so we can write the equation: 
x = 33 

Now we can substitute x into the first equation to find the cost of the boots: 
3(33) = boots - 5 
99 = boots - 5 
boots = 99 + 5 
boots = 104 

The final answer is: 104"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x, where x is a constant.

Since their total age now is 162, we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages:

Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide by the number of people.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first one: 80 / 2 = 40, then 40 + 20 = 60.
The third person guesses 25% more than the first one: 80 * 0.25 = 20, then 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 people, so we divide the total by 3 to find the average: 240 / 3 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find out how many hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to first calculate the total hours he spends per day. 

He has 10 dogs and each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. 

Total hours per day = 10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the total hours per day by 7 to get the total hours per week.

Total hours per week = 5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We know that G = S + 30. We also know that the total number of coins is 110, so S + G = 110.

Substituting G = S + 30 into the second equation, we get S + (S + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2S = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30: G = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 1. Then, we add this to the original 4 points to find the total points scored in the second 20 minutes: 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes to find the total points: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The total points Mike scored is 9."

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys in 30 days. 

60 yogurts / 4 yogurts per set = 15 sets.

Since each set costs $5.00, Terry spends 15 * $5.00 = $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

"To find out how many Lego sets John has left, we first need to calculate how much money he made from selling the Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = $195.

Then, he bought 8 video games for $20 each, so the total amount of money he spent on video games is 8 * 20 = $160.

After buying the video games, he had $5 left. This means he had $195 - $160 = $35 left after buying the video games.

Since he had $35 left after buying the video games, and he had $5 left after buying the video games, it means he spent $30 on the video games. However, we know he spent $160 on the video games, so the $30 must be the money he had before buying the video games.

Now, we know he had $30 before buying the video games, and he made $195 from selling the Lego sets. This means he must have spent $195 - $30 = $165 on the video games. However, we know he spent $160 on the video games, so the $5 difference must be the money he had left after buying the video games.

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his total running time and then divide the total distance by the total time.

John runs 3 hours the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

Total hours run per week = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Since John runs 60 miles a week and 3 days a week, we can also calculate his average speed per day as 60 miles / 3 days = 20 miles per day.

However, to find his speed in miles per hour, we need to divide the total distance by the total time. 

Total distance = 60 miles
Total time = 6 hours

Speed = Total distance / Total time = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out Dana's walking speed first. Since she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, and she can skip at 3 miles per hour, her running speed is twice her skipping speed, which is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, in 6 hours, she spends 2 hours running and 4 hours walking.

Distance = speed * time. So, the distance she travels while running is 6 * 2 = 12 miles, and the distance she travels while walking is 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles.

The total distance she can travel in six hours is 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the information given:

"To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to calculate the total distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone and then subtract the dragon's reach.

When Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the total distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces. 

First, let's find the total number of pieces. Since Grandma Jones cut each pie into 8 pieces and she baked 5 pies, the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40.

Now, let's subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces to find out how many were taken by the guests. 

40 (total pieces) - 14 (remaining pieces) = 26

So, 26 pieces of pie were taken by the guests."
"To find out how many calories you can still consume, subtract the calories you've already consumed from your daily target. 

2000 (daily target) - 1800 (already consumed) = 200 calories left

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find out how many servings you can have.

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, multiply the number of servings you can have by the total weight of the bag to find out how many grams you can eat.

0.8 servings * 300g = 240g

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total cost. Since Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for 10 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks for 20 candles. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is $10.00. 

Next, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles. The total revenue is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Now, let's find the net profit. The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. The total cost is $10.00, and the total revenue is $40.00. 

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $10.00
Net profit = $30.00

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since it takes 4 hours to write one article, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

The final answer is: 104"
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to first determine how many Post-it notes she used in total. 

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work. To find the total number of Post-it notes she used, we add 80 and 220: 80 + 220 = 300. 

Since she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, we need to subtract 23 from the total number of Post-it notes she used to find out how many she purchased: 300 - 23 = 277.

The final answer is: 277"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find the number of blue ties, we can divide the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

Now, we know that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. This means the cost of each red tie is 1.5 times the cost of each blue tie:

Cost of each red tie = 1.5 * Cost of each blue tie
= 1.5 * $40
= $60

To find the total amount spent on red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches by multiplying 4 by 12.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we need to divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches) to find out how many pieces Tracy obtained.

48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

"To find the total number of units in the building, we multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. 

15 floors * 8 units per floor = 120 units

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units. 

1/4 of 120 units = (1/4) * 120 = 30 units

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs are produced per week: 
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 252 * 7 = 1764 eggs per week

Since Lloyd sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens: 
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total amount Lloyd makes per week: 
147 dozen eggs * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

"To find the total time Tom spent traveling, we first need to find the time he spent traveling from 1 to 4 PM. Since he traveled from 1 to 4 PM, that's a total of 3 hours.

The distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM is not given, but we can find it using the formula distance = speed * time. 

Distance = speed * time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, we know the distance is 30 miles and the speed is 6 mph. We can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the time it took him to get back.

Time = distance / speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

"To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the total weight of the comic books he removed. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removed 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books already removed weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys to be removed can be calculated by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

"To find the revenue earned on Thursday, we need to calculate the total revenue from truck tires and car tires separately and then add them together. 

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday: 6 truck tires * $60 per tire = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday: 4 car tires * $40 per tire = $160
Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Revenue from car tires on Friday: 12 car tires * $40 per tire = $480

Since the revenue from car tires on Friday ($480) is higher than the revenue from both truck and car tires on Thursday ($520), we need to compare the revenue from car tires on Friday with the total revenue on Thursday.

To find the difference in revenue, we subtract the revenue from car tires on Friday from the total revenue on Thursday: $520 - $480 = $40

"To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 30 years and then add 5% of that value.

Marcy works for 30 years, but she only gets the full pension for 10 years (30 - 20 = 10). For the remaining 20 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension.

The value of the pension for 10 years is 10 * $50,000 = $500,000.

For the remaining 20 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension, which is 0.05 * $500,000 = $25,000.

So, her annual pension after 30 years will be $50,000 (for the first 10 years) + $25,000 (for the remaining 20 years) = $75,000.

"To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately and then add them together.

The streaming service charges $140 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the first half of the year would be 6 months. 

The amount she paid for the first half of the year is 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the company charged her 10% less money. To find the amount she paid for the second half of the year, we need to calculate 10% of $140 and subtract it from $140.

10% of $140 = 0.1 * $140 = $14
Amount paid for the second half of the year = $140 - $14 = $126

The amount she paid for the second half of the year is $126.

Now, we add the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year to find the total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to determine the car's miles per gallon (mpg) rating. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled since the last fill-up (100 miles) by the amount of gas used (4 gallons).

mpg = distance / gas used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the car's mpg rating, we can find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity (12 gallons) by the mpg rating.

"To find the average square footage of a level, we need to find the total square footage of all levels and then divide it by the number of levels.

The top level has a square footage of 16. Since each level below it has half the square footage, the second level will have 16 / 2 = 8 square footage. The third level will have 8 / 2 = 4 square footage, and the fourth level will have 4 / 2 = 2 square footage.

Now, let's add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

There are 4 levels in total. To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days. So, the total amount of dog food eaten in the first 180 days is 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.

The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the total amount of dog food eaten in the rest of the year is 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food eaten in the first year is 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year is 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

Now, let's find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
= 200 - 100
= 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the better price, we need to compare the cost per flower of each package. 

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers is the better deal.

To find the cost of 18 flowers at the better price, we multiply the cost per flower by the number of flowers: $0.5 * 18 = $9.

Now, let's find the cost of 18 flowers at the worse price (package of 3 flowers). We need to find out how many packages of 3 flowers Vincent needs to buy to get 18 flowers: 18 / 3 = 6 packages. The cost of 6 packages is 6 * $2.50 = $15.

The amount of money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price is $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

Original price: $100
Discount percentage: 30%

The total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let the number of games they lost be x. 
Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. 
So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2: x = 7

Since x is the number of games they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

The first time it went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to first calculate her salary after 5 years of service, and then calculate the increase for the next 3 years.

Initial salary: $600
Increase after 5 years: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 5 years: $600 + $60 = $660

Now, we need to calculate the increase for the next 3 years. Since the increase is 10% of the current salary, we will apply the increase to the salary after 5 years.

Increase after 6 years: 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 6 years: $660 + $66 = $726

Increase after 7 years: 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 7 years: $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Increase after 8 years: 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 8 years: $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Increase after 9 years: 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.85

We know that the total number of copies sold is 88,000, so we can set up the equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

16 (invited guests) - (1/4 * 16) = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of guests who will attend by 0.75.

12 (guests) * 0.75 (gift bags per guest) = 9

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag.

9 (gift bags) * $2 (cost per gift bag) = $18

"To find out how much potato salad Ted needs, we first need to calculate how much an adult and a child will eat. 

An adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult, so a child will eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults and the children. 

For the adults, 20 adults will eat 20 * 10 = 200 lbs of potato salad. 
For the children, 5 children will eat 5 * 5 = 25 lbs of potato salad.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amount for the adults and the children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Total cars originally on the motorway = 30
- 5 cars took an exit, so the remaining cars that drove through the traffic jam = 30 - 5 = 25
- Total cars that drove through the traffic jam = cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes + cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes
- Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes = 20

Let's represent the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. Then, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20.

Since we know that the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, we can set up the equation:
x + 20 = 25

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
x = 25 - 20
x = 5

So, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

First, we need to find out how many 3-mile sections are in 42 miles. We can do this by dividing 42 by 3.

42 miles / 3 miles per section = 14 sections

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each section, we can multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section.

14 sections * 10 minutes per section = 140 minutes

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To find the inner volume of one box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the dimensions of the box. 

The length of the inner box is 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side).
The width of the inner box is 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side).
The height of the inner box is 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side).

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the length, width, and height: 
Inner volume of one box = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Monday and Tuesday: 2 nights * 1 hour per night = 2 hours
- Wednesday: We don't know the number of episodes, but each episode is 30 minutes, so let's call the number of episodes x. The total time watched on Wednesday is 30x minutes.
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes) = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 * 1 hour = 2 hours

The total time watched is 2 + 30x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 hours. 

Now, let's convert everything to the same unit (hours) and solve for x:
2 + 30x + 1.5 + 2 = 7
Combine like terms:
5.5 + 30x = 7
Subtract 5.5 from both sides:
30x = 1.5
Divide both sides by 30:
x = 0.05

Since x represents the number of 30-minute episodes, we need to convert it to a whole number of episodes. However, 0.05 is not a whole number, but since we can't watch a fraction of an episode, we can round down to 0 episodes or round up to 1 episode. However, since 0.05 is very close to 0, we can assume that Frankie watched 0 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday."
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let x be the number of cookies Henry baked last year. 

This year, Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so he bakes 2x cookies. However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the total number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

As he is putting the cookies out to cool, he drops 5 cookies, so the total number of cookies he has left is 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10.

We are given that the total number of cookies Henry has left is 110, so we can set up the equation 2x + 10 = 110.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

2x + 10 - 10 = 110 - 10
2x = 100

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:

2x / 2 = 100 / 2
x = 50

2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

From point 1, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

From point 2, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This means that the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 300 / 50 = 6.

"To find the total cost of the lumber, we need to calculate the cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards and the 4 x 4 x 10 boards.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 each = $100.
The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 each = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. 

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each.
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 each = $150.
The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 each = $120.

"To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to first find the total parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 13 = 20. 

Since the total amount of sugar and water used is 120, we can set up a proportion to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used. 

Let x be the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used. The proportion is 7/20 = x/120. 

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 7 * 120 = 20x. 

This simplifies to 840 = 20x. 

Now, we can divide both sides by 20 to solve for x: x = 840 / 20 = 42.

So, John paid $360."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

On the second day, the total number of vehicles became 30. To find the number of vehicles brought in on the second day, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers brought in on the second day is 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. If we let Lylah's salary be x, then Adrien's salary is 1.3x.

We are also given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000. Since his salary increased by 40% over four years, we can set up the equation:

1.3x = 40000 / 1.4 (to find the original salary, we divide by 1.4 because 100% + 40% = 140%, or 1.4)

1.3x = 40000 / 1.4
1.3x = 28571.43
x = 28571.43 / 1.3
x = 22000

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was $22000.

Now, we need to find their salaries four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so his new salary is:
40000 * 1.4 = 56000

Lylah's salary increased by 40% as well, so her new salary is:
22000 * 1.4 = 30800

The total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later is:
56000 + 30800 = 86800

The final answer is: $86800"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to first find out how many sheets he uses in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets of paper. So, the total number of sheets he uses in a week is:
2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of sheets Miguel uses in a week by 4 to find the total number of sheets he uses in a month:
60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then add them together.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples.
Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each person brought:
Morisette: 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits
Kael: 10 apples + 4 oranges = 14 fruits

The total number of fruits they have is 13 + 14 = 27."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.
- For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.
- For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept for each period:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday and Wednesday: 2 days * 6 hours = 12 hours
- Thursday to Sunday: 5 days * 7 hours = 35 hours

Now, let's add up the total hours she slept throughout the week:
8 + 12 + 35 = 55

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate the distance she runs in the first 3 hours and the distance she runs in the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour. So, the distance she covers in 3 hours is:
Distance = Speed x Time = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours = 30 miles

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. So, the distance she covers in 4 hours is:
Distance = Speed x Time = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours = 20 miles

Now, we add the distances covered in the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:
Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Jennie starts with a pile of 60 letters needing stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of these letters. 

To find out how many letters she stamped, we need to calculate one-third of 60. 

One-third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20. 

So, Jennie stamped 20 letters. 

Now, we know that after stamping these 20 letters, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. 

This means that before Jennie started stamping, there were 30 - 20 = 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons while making the stew.
4. After using the spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as 'x'. 

From point 2, we know that Julia had 'x' spoons initially. 
From point 3, we know that after using 3 spoons, Julia had 'x - 3' spoons left.
From point 4, we know that after her husband gave her 5 more spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. 

So, we can set up the equation: x - 3 + 5 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages.

Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 
He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

To find the total number of sausages, we add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages: 38 + 44 = 82.

The final answer is: 82"

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to find the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity.

First, let's find the cost of a watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, let's find the cost of an orange. Since an orange costs 5 dollars less than what a watermelon costs, an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each item:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To find the total time spent by doctors, we need to multiply the number of patients by the average time each patient is seen. 

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total minutes to hours.

12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The hospital pays the doctors $150/hour, so the total cost is:

200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

The hospital charges the patients $200/hour, so the total revenue is:

200 hours * $200/hour = $40000

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

$40000 - $30000 = $10000

The hospital makes $10000 in profit from these visits."
"To find out how many elves are left, we need to follow the steps:

1. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. Since there are 60 elves, a third of them is 60 / 3 = 20. So, 20 elves quit.

Now, there are 60 - 20 = 40 elves left.

2. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, we subtract 10 from the remaining 40 elves: 40 - 10 = 30.

Therefore, there are 30 elves left.

The final answer is: 30"

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she rode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides is 4 (Pam's rides) + 6 (Fred's rides) = 10 rides.

Each ride costs 6 tickets, so the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Let the number of baby bees be x.
- Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2x.
- There are twice as many babies as queens, so the number of queens is x/2.
- The total number of bees is 700, which is the sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens. 

We can write the equation: x + 2x + x/2 = 700

To solve for x, we multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + 4x + x = 1400

Combine like terms: 7x = 1400

Divide both sides by 7: x = 200

Since the number of worker bees is 2x, we multiply x by 2: 2 * 200 = 400

The number of worker bees is 400."

Non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
Total cost of non-food items: 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
Tax = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of non-food items:
Total cost of non-food items with tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax:
Total cost = 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

"I think there's been a mistake in the question. It says ""Kim has started his own housekeeping business"" but then later refers to ""Lucas."" I'll assume the correct name is Kim.

To calculate the total expenses, we need to find out how many bottles of bleach and packs of cloths Kim will need for all 8 clients (3 current clients + 5 potential clients). Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths, so the total number of bottles of bleach needed is 8 * 2 = 16 and the total number of packs of cloths needed is 8 * 1 = 8.

The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle, so the total cost of bleach is 16 * $2 = $32. The cost of cloths is $5 per pack, so the total cost of cloths is 8 * $5 = $40.

The total expenses are $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72.

Kim's total income is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income: $92 - $72 = $20.

"To find out who wins the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet for both Steve and Tim. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, we can convert their distances as follows:

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school:

Steve's time: distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes to get home and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve wins the race. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time:

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To find out how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires. 

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and there were 5 bicycles. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * 25 cents = 250 cents. 

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert 250 cents to dollars by dividing by 100: 250 / 100 = 2.5 dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and there were 3 tricycles. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * 25 cents = 225 cents. 

Converting 225 cents to dollars: 225 / 100 = 2.25 dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. There was 1 unicycle, so the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1. 

The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * 25 cents = 25 cents. 

Converting 25 cents to dollars: 25 / 100 = 0.25 dollars.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total number of fries eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
   Now, the total number of fries eaten by Dave, the seagull, and the pigeons is 21 + 9 = 30.
4. A raccoon ate two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's call the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it 'x'. 
   After the pigeons ate, the remaining fries are x - 30. 
   The raccoon ate two-thirds of this, which is (2/3) * (x - 30).
   The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (x - 30) - (2/3) * (x - 30).
   Simplifying this, we get (1/3) * (x - 30).
5. After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. 
   So, the remaining fries after the raccoon ate are 5.
   Setting this equal to (1/3) * (x - 30), we get:
   (1/3) * (x - 30) = 5
   Multiplying both sides by 3, we get:
   x - 30 = 15
   Adding 30 to both sides, we get:
   x = 45

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.
The gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
The baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, let's add up the total number of bananas needed for 2 months: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he's running back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: 80"

"To find the depth of the water on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.
On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = (24 * 2) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we need to add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish he caught. 

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin.
Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
Total fish caught = 19 + 13
Total fish caught = 32

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Brooke's current age be x. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is 2x.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be x + 2, and Seth's age will be 2x + 2.

According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. We can write an equation based on this information:

(x + 2) + (2x + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3x + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3x = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 8

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age is 2x, which is 2(8) = 16.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and there are 200 pink calla lilies. 

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Then, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x, and we know that 5x = 200. 

To find 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5: 
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations, we can find out how many red roses she ordered. We know that she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of red roses as 'y'. Then, y = 4x, and we know that x = 40.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To find the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3, we need to count the favorable outcomes and divide by the total number of outcomes.

There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 or 50%.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to count the favorable outcomes and divide by the total number of outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Now, we need to find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row. 

The difference in probability is 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

So, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: 25"

"To find the number of rats in each cage, we first need to determine the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters) and the total number of straw pieces given to them. 

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of rats is 3r. 

The total number of hamsters is 10. 

The total number of straw pieces given to rats is 3r * 6 = 18r. 
The total number of straw pieces given to hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50. 

The total number of straw pieces given to small rodents is 160. So, the equation becomes: 18r + 50 = 160.

Now, let's solve for 'r':

18r + 50 = 160
18r = 110
r = 110 / 18
r = 6.11 (approximately)

However, since the number of rats must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the equation. 

Let's re-examine the total number of straw pieces given to small rodents: 160. We know that 50 pieces are given to hamsters. So, the remaining straw pieces are given to rats: 160 - 50 = 110.

The total number of straw pieces given to rats is 18r. So, the equation becomes: 18r = 110.

However, we made an error in our previous calculation. Let's re-calculate 'r':

18r = 110
r = 110 / 18
r = 6.11 (approximately)

Since the number of rats must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the equation again. 

Let's re-examine the total number of straw pieces given to small rodents: 160. We know that 50 pieces are given to hamsters. So, the remaining straw pieces are given to rats: 160 - 50 = 110.

The total number of straw pieces given to rats is 18r. So, the equation becomes: 18r = 110.

However, we made an error in our previous calculation. Let's re-calculate 'r':

18r = 110

The interest for the third month is $102 + $2.04 = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

The total interest is $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

The total amount Mandy should pay is the initial amount plus the total interest: $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

Rounded to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to first calculate the total cost and total revenue.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $400. So, we can set up the equation:

Total Revenue - Total Cost = Profit
$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:
$8x = $400

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 8:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

So, the trader sold 50 bags."
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, they spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75 on food.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to first find out how many minutes he collects peaches for. Since he collects peaches for 3 hours, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes per hour.

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now that we know John collects peaches for 180 minutes, and he can collect 2 peaches per minute, we multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks need per day, we first need to find out how many pounds they need per week. Since there are ten ducks and each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we multiply the number of ducks by the amount of insects each duck needs per week.

10 ducks * 3.5 pounds/duck/week = 35 pounds/week

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total pounds of insects needed per week by 7 to find out how many pounds they need per day.

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the total number of trees he has after 10 years, and then subtract the trees that die.

Tom starts with 50 trees. 

Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. So, the net change in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8.

After 10 years, the net change in trees is 8 * 10 = 80.

So, the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years is 50 + 80 = 130.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find out how many trees die, we need to calculate 30% of 130.

30% of 130 is 0.3 * 130 = 39.

So, the number of trees that die is 39.

The number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find the number of pink and white flamingos, let's break down the events:

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, there are now 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. Now, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

The total number of flamingos is 6 (white) + 30 (pink) = 36.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 (pink) - 6 (white) = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many crayons Violetta can buy, we need to divide the amount of money she has by the cost of one crayon. 

Violetta has $20 and one crayon costs $2. 

20 / 2 = 10

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color. 

2 * 5 = 10

Violetta can buy 10 crayons in total. 

Since she has $20 and each crayon costs $2, the total cost of the crayons will be 10 * 2 = $20.

Violetta will get $0 in change because she spent the exact amount she had."
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser. 

Cost of a pencil: $1.20
Cost of an eraser: $0.30
Cost of a pen: $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. 

Cost of 8 pens: $1.50 * 8 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total pounds of carrots that will be used by the restaurants. 

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots used = Number of restaurants * Pounds per restaurant
Total pounds of carrots used = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots used = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total pounds of carrots used from the total pounds of carrots available to find out how many pounds will not be used.

Pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds of carrots - Total pounds of carrots used
Pounds of carrots not used = 200 - 80
Pounds of carrots not used = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the number of children in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times that number, so she collected 3 * 20 = 60 cards.
   Now, Elaine has 20 + 60 = 80 cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, so she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
   Now, Elaine has 80 + 40 = 120 cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. 
   The combined number of cards collected in the first and second months is 60 + 40 = 100.
   So, she collected 2 * 100 = 200 cards in the third month.
   Now, Elaine has 120 + 200 = 320 cards.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Mark edits 1000 sentences each week.
- Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence.
- Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence.
- Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, so he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Now, let's calculate Mark's earnings from each publisher:

- From Publisher A: 500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents
- From Publisher B: 500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Total earnings = 2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

"To find the total amount John made that year, we need to calculate his new salary after the 5% raise and then multiply it by the number of weeks he worked.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise: 
5% of 2000 is 0.05 * 2000 = $100
New salary = 2000 + 100 = $2100

Since John got the award on the first day of the year, he will have the new salary for all 52 weeks of the year. 
Total amount from the new salary = 2100 * 52 = $109200

The award has a one-time monetary reward of $5000. 
Total amount John made that year = 109200 + 5000 = $114200

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish separately and then add them together.

For sandwiches: Carl ate a sandwich every day for a week (7 days) and used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. 
Total slices for sandwiches = 7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices

For omelets: Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days of the week and used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. 
Total slices for omelets = 3 days * (2 + 1) slices/day = 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices

For macaroni and cheese: Carl used 8 slices of cheese in the dish.

Total slices of cheese used = slices for sandwiches + slices for omelets + slices for macaroni and cheese
Total slices of cheese used = 14 + 9 + 8
Total slices of cheese used = 31

"To find out how many pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the total number of pens she had initially and then add the number of pens she bought.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she had a total of 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, let's add the number of pens she bought to the number of pens she initially had: 32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98 pens.

"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply 93 by 6 to get the total score.

Total score needed = 93 * 6
Total score needed = 558

Next, we need to find the total score Brinley has so far. We add up the scores of the first five tests.

Total score so far = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86
Total score so far = 338

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, we need to find the lowest score among the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score Brinley needs after removing the lowest score, we subtract the lowest score from the total score so far.

Total score after removing the lowest = Total score so far - Lowest score
Total score after removing the lowest = 338 - 71
Total score after removing the lowest = 267

Now, we need to find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to get a total score of 558. We subtract the total score after removing the lowest from the total score needed.

Score needed on the sixth test = Total score needed - Total score after removing the lowest
Score needed on the sixth test = 558 - 267
Score needed on the sixth test = 291

"To find the total weight of the chocolate bars, we need to multiply the number of chocolate bars by their weight. 

Number of chocolate bars: 25
Weight of each chocolate bar: 40g
Total weight of chocolate bars: 25 * 40g = 1000g

To find the weight of each candied apple, we need to divide the weight of a chocolate bar by 2 since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.

Weight of each chocolate bar: 40g
Weight of each candied apple: 40g / 2 = 20g

To find the total weight of the candied apples, we need to multiply the number of candied apples by their weight.

Number of candied apples: 80
Weight of each candied apple: 20g
Total weight of candied apples: 80 * 20g = 1600g

"To find out how much money Sara needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and 2 pairs of shoes cost $20 each, so the total cost of the shoes is 2 * $20 = $40. The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs $70 - $10 = $60 more to buy the jacket and shoes.

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting. 

To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we need to subtract the money she earns from babysitting from the total amount she needs. $60 - $20 = $40. 

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we need to divide $40 by $4 to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn. $40 / $4 = 10.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can set up the equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

"To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

To find the number of customers on Day 3, we need to subtract the total customers on Day 1 and Day 2 from the total customers by Day 3.

Customers on Day 3 = Total customers by Day 3 - (Customers on Day 1 + Customers on Day 2)
= 500 - (100 + 150)
= 500 - 250
= 250

"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of water loss for both pools is 8 gallons/minute in total.

In 4 minutes, the total water lost from both pools is 8 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 32 gallons.

The big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y'. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y.

We know that the initial amount of water in the big pool (2x) minus the water lost (32 gallons) is equal to the current amount of water in the big pool (4y). So, we can set up the equation:

2x - 32 = 4y

We also know that the initial amount of water in the small pool (x) minus the water lost (32 gallons) is equal to the current amount of water in the small pool (y). So, we can set up another equation:

x - 32 = y

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y by substituting the second equation into the first equation:

2(x - 32) - 32 = 4y
2x - 64 - 32 = 4y
2x - 96 = 4y

Now, substitute x - 32 for y in the equation above:

2x = 32
x = 16

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into the equation x - 32 = y:

16 - 32 = y
-16 = y

However, since y represents the amount of water in the small pool, it cannot be negative. This means that the initial amount of water in the small pool was not enough to last 4 minutes with a leak rate of 4 gallons/minute. This is a problem with the given information.

However, if we assume that the initial amount of water in the small pool was enough to last 4 minutes with a leak rate of 4 gallons/minute, then the initial amount of water in the small pool would be 32 gallons (since 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons, and the pool would have 32 gallons to start with to last 4 minutes). 

Now, we can find the current amount of water in the small pool (y) by subtracting the water lost (32 gallons) from the initial amount of water in the small pool (32 gallons):

y = 32 - 32

However, if we assume that the initial amount of water in the small pool was enough to last 4 minutes with a leak rate of 4 gallons/minute, then the initial amount of water in the small pool would be 32 gallons (since 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons, and the pool would have 32 gallons to start with to last 4 minutes). 

Now, we can find the current amount of water in the small pool (y) by subtracting the water lost (32 gallons) from the initial amount of water in the small pool (32 gallons):

y = 32 - 32
y = 0

However, this is not the correct answer because the problem states that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now. If the small pool has 0 gallons, then the big pool would also have 0 gallons, which contradicts the problem statement.

Let's re-examine the problem. We know that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y'. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y.

We know that the initial amount of water in the big pool (2x) minus the water lost (32 gallons) is equal to the current amount of water in the big pool (4y). So, we can set up the equation:

2x - 32 = 4y

We also know that the initial amount of water in the small pool (x) minus the water lost (32 gallons) is equal to the current amount of water in the small pool (y). So, we can set up another equation:

x - 32 = y

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y by substituting the second equation into the first equation:

2(x - 32) - 32 = 4y
2x - 64 - 32 = 4y
2x - 96 = 4y

Now, substitute x - 32 for y in the equation above:

2(x - 32) - 96 = 4(x - 32)
2x - 64 - 96 = 4x - 128
-160 = 2x - 128
2x = 32
x = 16

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into the equation x - 32 = y:

16 - 32 = y
-16 = y

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn, which is the cost of the shoes and the belt. 

Total cost = cost of shoes + cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Since Lori earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours to work = 44 hours

"To find the total amount Janeth will pay, we need to calculate the total interest she will pay over 12 months. 

First, let's find the interest she will pay each month. 10% of $2000 is 0.1 x $2000 = $200. 

Since she will pay $165 a month, the remaining amount she will pay each month as interest is $200 - $165 = $35.

Now, let's find the total interest she will pay over 12 months. $35 x 12 = $420.

The total amount she will pay is the initial amount plus the interest. $2000 + $420 = $2420.

Since she will pay $165 a month for 12 months, the total amount she will pay is $165 x 12 = $1980.

The remaining balance will be the total amount she will pay minus the initial amount. $2420 - $1980 = $440.

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to know the number of dahlias. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age is 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years.
3. Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years.

Now, let's calculate their ages in three years:

1. Harriet's age in three years = 21 + 3 = 24 years.
2. Zack's age in three years = 42 + 3 = 45 years.
3. Adrian's age in three years = 63 + 3 = 66 years.

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:

Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored. 

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. 

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

We know that the total points scored by the four students is 251. 
We know that Naomi scored 68 points, Yuri scored 44 points, and Brianna scored 85 points. 
So, the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points. 

To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to subtract the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points scored by all four students. 
So, Jojo scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then convert that to hours.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike receives from his remaining 3 pen pals. Since each of them sends 2 letters a week, and there are 3 of them, the total number of letters he receives is 2 * 3 = 6 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

4. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as 'x'. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now Griffin has (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.
7. To find the value of 'x', we need to solve the equation: x = 27 - 7 = 20.

Total amount spent = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total amount spent = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total. 

Amount each person paid = Total amount spent / Number of people
Amount each person paid = $96 / 3
Amount each person paid = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight of the onions is:
4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost is:
200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"Let's break down the information given:

- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. 
- Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. 
- Her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
The total calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

The difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls, the total number of girls in these two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls in the school is 50% of the total number of students. Let's denote the total number of students as 'T'. Then, 50% of T is 27. 

We can write this as 0.5T = 27. To find T, we divide both sides by 0.5: T = 27 / 0.5 = 54.

Now that we know the total number of students in the school is 54, and there are 3 classes, each with 20 students, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60. However, we already know the total number of students is 54, so this is not necessary.

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of boys is also 50% of 54, which is 0.5 * 54 = 27.

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls, so the total number of girls in these two classes is 27. This means the remaining girls are in the third class. Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls in the school is 27. The number of girls in the third class is 27 - 27 = 0.

"Let's break down the information given:

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's represent the number of cougars killed today as 'x'. Then, the number of wolves killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12 to find the number of wolves killed today. Solving for x, we get x = 4. 

However, we already know that the number of cougars killed today is 12, so we don't need to use x. 

Now, we can find the total number of animals killed by adding the number of wolves and cougars killed last night and today. 

Total animals killed = (10 + 15) + (3 * 12) + 12
Total animals killed = 25 + 36 + 12
Total animals killed = 73

So, the number of cows added to each stall is 40 / 10 = 4 cows.

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8:

24 * 8 = 192

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections and then multiply it by the weight of each section. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of 8000 from 8000 to find the final weight. 

To find 30% of 8000, we multiply 8000 by 0.3: 8000 * 0.3 = 2400.

Now, we subtract 2400 from 8000: 8000 - 2400 = 5600.

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we first need to determine how many cups of flour are needed for each day. 

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies Carla is making. 

36 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 3 dozen cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, Carla will need 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour for today.

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. Again, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies she is making.

30 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 2.5 dozen cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, Carla will need 2.5 * 2 = 5 cups of flour for tomorrow.

In total, Carla will need 6 cups of flour for today and 5 cups of flour for tomorrow, so she will need 6 + 5 = 11 cups of flour.

Two thirds of 9,300 can be calculated as (2/3) * 9,300. 

To do this, we multiply 9,300 by 2 and then divide by 3. 

9,300 * 2 = 18,600 

18,600 / 3 = 6,200 

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62.00

"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract it from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 
Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee:
Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000

Now, let's calculate the total fees paid:
Total fees = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee = $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000

Next, let's calculate the net proceeds from selling the house before paying the loan:
Net proceeds before loan = Selling price - Total fees = $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000

Finally, let's subtract the remaining loan amount:
Net proceeds = Net proceeds before loan - Remaining loan amount = $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 x 20 = 8 minutes. 
So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 20 + 28 + 23 = 71 minutes.

The final answer is: 71"
"To find the total amount spent on newspaper ads, we multiply the cost of each ad by the number of ads: $5 * 50 = $250.

To find the total amount spent on television ads, we multiply the cost of each ad by the number of ads: $75 * 15 = $1125.

Now, we add the total amount spent on newspaper ads and television ads to find the total amount spent on all ads: $250 + $1125 = $1375.

The final answer is: $1375"
"To find the number of blue golf balls, we first need to find the total number of golf balls. Since half of the balls are golf balls, and the juggler can juggle 16 balls, the number of golf balls is 16 / 2 = 8.

Now, we know that half of the golf balls are blue. So, the number of blue golf balls is 8 / 2 = 4.

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The final answer is: 762"
"To find the total number of windows in the bedrooms, we first need to find the total number of bedrooms and then multiply it by the number of windows in each bedroom. 

There are 2 houses with 3 bedrooms each, so the total number of bedrooms is 2 * 3 = 6. 

Each bedroom has 2 windows, so the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12.

There are 4 additional windows in each house not connected to bedrooms, so the total number of additional windows is 2 * 4 = 8.

Now, we add the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows to find the total number of windows between the houses. 

Total windows = 12 (in bedrooms) + 8 (additional) = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the items, we need to add the cost of the cocoa, laundry, and pasta.

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35
Total cost = $14.00

Change = $20 - $14.00
Change = $6.00

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to find the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, and the body of the sweater takes 900 stitches, the total number of stitches for the sleeves is 1800 - 900 - 270 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

The final answer is: 315"
"To find the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately and then add them together.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.

The total cost of the seeds is $800 + $2400 = $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the total number of lines for each scene and the song, and then add them up.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines to memorize from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines to memorize from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add up the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to find the number of cards that didn't have the letter A, then subtract the number of cards with the letter B from that, and finally subtract the number of cards with the letter C from that.

First, let's find the number of cards with the letter A: 
2/5 of 80 cards had the letter A, so the number of cards with A is 2/5 * 80 = 32.

Now, let's find the number of cards that didn't have the letter A: 
80 - 32 = 48.

Next, let's find the number of cards with the letter B: 
1/2 of the remaining 48 cards had the letter B, so the number of cards with B is 1/2 * 48 = 24.

Now, let's find the number of cards that didn't have the letter B: 
48 - 24 = 24.

Next, let's find the number of cards with the letter C: 
5/8 of the remaining 24 cards had the letter C, so the number of cards with C is 5/8 * 24 = 15.

Now, let's find the number of cards that didn't have the letter C: 
24 - 15 = 9.

The number of cards with the letter D is 9."
"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Time for small holes: 3 minutes per hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 10 minutes per hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Total time in minutes: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

"Let's break down the problem. 

Mico and Marco's current ages sum up to 20. 

Let's assume Mico's age is x and Marco's age is (20 - x), since their ages sum up to 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be (x + 10) and Marco's age will be (20 - x + 10) = (30 - x).

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + (30 - x) = 40.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Sam's current age as 'S' and Ruby's current age as 'R'. 

We are given that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write an equation: R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Now, let's substitute the value of R from the first equation into the second equation: 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Expanding the equation, we get: 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get: 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get: 3S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: S = 6.

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars together: $5 + $2 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots on each cobra: 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

Since the cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, the mamba has half the number of spots as the cobra. So, the number of spots on each mamba is 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

To find the total number of spots on the mambas, we multiply the number of mambas by the number of spots on each mamba: 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

Now, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Half the number of spots they all have combined is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"To find out how many people Maddy needs to buy pizza for, we need to calculate the total number of team members, coaches, and guests. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. 
Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 
The total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas Maddy needs to buy is 39 / 3 = 13.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones, we multiply the number of gemstones by their length: 8 gemstones * 1 inch/gemstone = 8 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, we need to find out how many beads fit into the remaining space. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and 8 inches are taken up by the gemstones, so the remaining space is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Now, we divide the remaining space by the length of each bead: 17 inches / 0.25 inches/bead = 68 beads.

The final answer is: 68"

Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week.

Total stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. 

Alani doubled her stories: 20 * 2 = 40
Braylen doubled his stories: 40 * 2 = 80
Margot doubled her stories: 60 * 2 = 120

Total stories in the second week = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we need to add the total number of stories written in the first week and the second week.

"To find out how much money Kelly has, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has in cents. 

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, 5 quarters will be 5 x 25 = 125 cents. 

Kelly also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, 2 dimes will be 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

Now, let's add the total amount of money Kelly has: 125 cents (from quarters) + 20 cents (from dimes) = 145 cents.

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how much money she has left, we need to subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.

"To find the number of rows of 5-star, we first need to find the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24. 

There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

Since each 5-star row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5 stars is 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"

"To find the time taken by the car in the fast lane, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. 

Given that the car in the fast lane traveled 480 miles at 60 miles/hour, we can calculate its time as follows:
Time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours.

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, its speed is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the same formula to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance:
Time = Distance / Speed = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ali has 22 medals.
2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
4. Together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, which means they have 1/10 of the total medals given out.

Let's represent the total medals given out as 'x'. Then, 1/10 of x is equal to 39. 

To find x, we multiply both sides by 10:
x = 39 * 10
x = 390

So, 390 medals have been given out for counting."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are available in total, we multiply the number of packets by the number of chocolate bars in each packet. 

8 packets * 5 chocolate bars per packet = 40 chocolate bars

Since each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, we multiply the number of adults by the number of chocolate bars each adult gets.

4 adults * 6 chocolate bars per adult = 24 chocolate bars

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children.

40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

Since there are 8 children, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children to find out how many each child will get.

16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars per child

"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the time to minutes first. 

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her hourly wage.

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

"Let's break down the information given:

- Mike has 21 points after 3 rounds.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's calculate the points after the fourth round. In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point, making it 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point, making it 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the fourth round:

Mike: 22 points
Jim: 18 points
Tony: 43 points

Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83

"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we first need to determine how many oranges the sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, and he washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 8 oranges. 

The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Fatima bought 15 oranges, and the sons washed 12 oranges. To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges: 15 - 12 = 3.

"To find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day. 

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, each person consumes 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per day (2 kg).

42 kg / 2 kg per day = 21 days

Since we want to know how many weeks the rice will last, we need to convert the number of days to weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the number of days by 7.

21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks. 

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he sold bread for 5 days. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. 

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates

Since he was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 working days. His target for the week was 120 crates, but he had 2 less working days. 

To find the target for 5 working days, we need to calculate the target for 7 days and then divide it by 7 and multiply by 5. 

Target for 7 days = 120 crates

"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to determine the last bid made by Carmen. 

The initial bid is $200. The bids rise by $50 each time. Since there are 3 other people who bid once, there are a total of 4 people who bid before Carmen wins. 

The bids will be: $200, $250, $300, $350, $400, and $450. 

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids 4 times. The bids will be: $450, $500, $550, $600.

The total cost of the desk is the last bid made by Carmen, which is $600. 

The final answer is: $600"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total miles driven, the total cost of driving, and the total bonus paid.

1. Total miles driven: Since John goes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 = 60 miles. 
   Since he goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, the total miles driven per year is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15000 miles.

2. Total cost of driving: He gets charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of driving per year is 15000 * $2 = $30000.

3. Total bonus paid: He gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid per year is $150 * 12 = $1800.

4. Total cost: The total cost is the sum of the total cost of driving and the total bonus paid, which is $30000 + $1800 = $31800.

The final answer is: $31800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of pages and how they are arranged in the tabloid. 

When folded, the paper is divided into two parts: the left and the right. Each part will have 16 pages (since 32 / 2 = 16). 

However, the pages are arranged in a specific order: page 1 on the left back, page 2 on the left front, page 32 on the right back, and page 31 on the right front. This means that the pages on the left and right are not consecutive, but rather mirrored.

To find the total number of pieces of paper needed, we need to consider that each page is printed on both sides, but the order of the pages is mirrored. 

Since there are 16 pages on each side, and each page is printed on both sides, we need 16 pieces of paper for the left side and 16 pieces of paper for the right side. However, we can't simply add these two numbers together because the pages are mirrored, and we need to account for the fact that the first and last pages are on the outside.

So, we need 16 pieces of paper for the left side and 16 pieces of paper for the right side, but we can't simply add these two numbers together. We need to consider that the first and last pages are on the outside, and the rest of the pages are on the inside.

The first and last pages are on the outside, and the rest of the pages are on the inside. This means that we need 1 piece of paper for the first page, 1 piece of paper for the last page, and 15 pieces of paper for the inside pages on each side.

So, we need 1 + 15 + 1 = 17 pieces of paper for each side. Since there are two sides, we need 2 * 17 = 34 pieces of paper.

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider that the first and last pages are on the outside, and the rest of the pages are on the inside. This means that we need 1 piece of paper for the first page, 1 piece of paper for the last page, and 15 pieces of paper for the inside pages on each side.

"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to first calculate how much she spent on food and snacks. Since she spent half of her $50 on food and snacks, we can calculate this as:

$50 / 2 = $25

She also spent an additional $10 on rides. 

So, the total amount she spent is:
$25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35

Now, to find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she brought:
$50 (initial amount) - $35 (total spent) = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total books = 250
- Unsold books = 50
- Books sold this year = 45
- Books sold in the first year = 2 * Books sold this year = 2 * 45 = 90
- Books sold in the second year = Total books - Unsold books - Books sold this year - Books sold in the first year
= 250 - 50 - 45 - 90
= 65

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
Total money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book
= 65 * 20
= 1300

The final answer is: $1300"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Since Watson gets a $300 bonus each week, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for April, which has 4 weeks:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

So, Watson made $3200 in April."
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to find 20% of 20, since he beat 80% of the people he arm wrestled.

20% of 20 is calculated as 0.2 * 20 = 4.

So, John lost to 4 people. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we first need to determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves. 

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. 

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The total number of loaves produced is 60, and 40 are sold in the morning. 

60 - 40 = 20 loaves are left.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. 

Half of 20 is calculated as (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of the remaining loaves.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much weight Sandy loses in a week, we need to divide the total weight Joey loses in 4 weeks by 4. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so in one week, Joey loses 8 / 4 = 2 pounds.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks. 

However, the question asks how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, Sandy will take the same amount of time as Joey to lose 2 pounds, which is 1 week."
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. 
The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22. 
The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. 
The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2. 
The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the total number of new limbs, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs separately and then add them together.

Extra arms: Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days, in 15 days, they will grow 15 / 3 = 5 extra arms.

Extra legs: Since the person grows an extra leg every 5 days, in 15 days, they will grow 15 / 5 = 3 extra legs.

Total new limbs = Extra arms + Extra legs = 5 + 3 = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we need to first calculate how much he has spent so far and how much he has left after saving $2000.

1. Cost of business suits: 6 suits * $100 = $600
2. Cost of suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 = $150
3. Cost of the flight ticket: 5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500, and the flight ticket costs $700 more than this, so the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200
4. Total cost so far: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950
5. Total amount saved: $2000
6. Total amount spent on the trip so far: $1950 (cost) + $2000 (saved) = $3950
7. Total amount available for gifts: $6000 (initial amount) - $3950 (total spent) = $2050

So, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

The final answer is: $2050"
"To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, we first need to find out how many eggs they consume in a day. 

There are 5 people in the family. Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs they eat in a day is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs. The rest of the people, which is 5 - 3 = 2, eat 2 eggs each day. So, the total number of eggs they eat in a day is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs. 

Now, we add the total number of eggs eaten by both groups: 9 + 4 = 13 eggs per day. 

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs eaten per day by 7: 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Trent is 5 years older than Jane.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.
3. Quinn is 30 years old.

Since Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, we can find Jane's age by subtracting 3 from Quinn's age:
Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now that we know Jane's age, we can find Trent's age by adding 5 to Jane's age:
Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
2. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
3. The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60000.
4. The population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, so the current population is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

The final answer is: 120000"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Let the number of players on the defense be D.
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it's 2D.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it's D/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. The sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams is 105. 

So, we can write the equation: D + 2D + D/2 = 105

To solve for D, we need to get rid of the fraction. Multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
2D + 4D + D = 210

Combine like terms:
7D = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:
D = 210 / 7
D = 30

The number of players on the defense is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

For the 2 families with 6 people: 2 * 6 = 12 people
For the 3 families with 4 people: 3 * 4 = 12 people
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24 people

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness, and 1/4 of that number had previous commitments. 
1/4 of 8 is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is 8 (due to illness) + 2 (previous commitments) = 10 people.

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited: 24 - 10 = 14 people.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. 

The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is length x width x height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost.

Cost per cubic foot = $0.1
Total cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot = 120 x 0.1 = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we first need to find the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

The number of nongendered children is 1/10 as many as the number of boys, so it is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children: 30 (boys) + 90 (girls) + 3 (nongendered children) = 123.

The final answer is: 123"
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

1 (electric pole) / 3 (electric wires) = x (electric poles) / 45 (electric wires)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

1 * 45 = 3x
45 = 3x

Now, divide both sides by 3 to find x:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women at the party. 

The total number of people at the party is 25 + 15 = 40.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. To find out how many people left, we need to calculate 1/4 of 40, which is 40 * 1/4 = 10.

So, 10 people left the party. Since 22 men stayed, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. This means that 10 - 3 = 7 women left the party.

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 left. To find out how many women are left, we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the cost of the pen, we first need to find the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

"Let's break down the problem. 

Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this: 3x + 2 = 26, where x is the number of pencils in each box. 

To find the number of pencils in each box, we need to solve for x. Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 26 - 2, 3x = 24. 

Now, divide both sides by 3: x = 24 / 3, x = 8. 

So, each box has 8 pencils. 

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 * 8 = 24 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. 

The total number of pencils they have is 24 + 46 = 70 pencils. 

To find the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we need to divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each box: 70 / 8 = 8.75. 

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

"To find the total weakening of the coffee, we need to calculate the weakening caused by the ice cubes and the cream separately, then add them together.

Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we need to find out how many ice cubes are used. 

Let's assume the initial temperature of the coffee is 100 degrees (for simplicity). 

The temperature difference is 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. 

Number of ice cubes = 65 / 13 = 5

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. So, 5 ice cubes will make it 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which weakens the coffee. 

Total weakening = 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

The final answer is: 75"
"Let's break down the problem. 

Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can assume that the ratio of new records to old records is 1:2. This means that for every 1 new record, 2 old records are traded.

Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records traded as follows:

7 new records * 2 old records/new record = 14 old records

However, this is the total number of old records traded by all 5 people. To find the number of old records each person brought in, we need to divide the total number of old records by 5.

14 old records / 5 people = 2.8 old records per person

Since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we can round down to 2 old records per person. However, this would mean that the total number of new records would be 3.5, which is not possible.

Let's re-examine the problem. If 5 people leave with 7 new records, it's possible that some people traded more than 2 old records for a new one. Let's try to find the least common multiple of the ratio 1:2.

The least common multiple of 1:2 is 1:2, but we need to find a number that when multiplied by 5 gives us a total of 7 new records. 

Let's try multiplying the ratio by 1.4 (7/5). This gives us a ratio of 1.4:2.8. 

Now, we can calculate the total number of old records traded as follows:

7 new records * 2.8 old records/new record = 19.6 old records

However, this is still not a whole number. Let's try multiplying the ratio by 1.4 again to get a ratio of 1.8:3.6.

7 new records * 3.6 old records/new record = 25.2 old records

This is still not a whole number. Let's try multiplying the ratio by 1.4 one more time to get a ratio of 2:4.

7 new records * 4 old records/new record = 28 old records

Now, we can divide the total number of old records by 5 to find the number of old records each person brought in:

28 old records / 5 people = 5.6 old records per person

Since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we can round down to 5 old records per person. However, this would mean that the total number of new records would be 2.5, which is not possible.

7 new records * 4.4 old records/new record = 30.8 old records

Now, we can divide the total number of old records by 5 to find the number of old records each person brought in:

30.8 old records / 5 people = 6.16 old records per person

Since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we can round down to 6 old records per person. However, this would mean that the total number of new records would be 3, which is not possible.

Let's try multiplying the ratio by 1.4 one more time to get a ratio of 2.6:5.2.

Now, we can divide the total number of old records by 5 to find the number of old records each person brought in:

39.2 old records / 5 people = 7.84 old records per person

Since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we can round down to 7 old records per person. However, this would mean that the total number of new records would be 3.5, which is not possible.

Let's try multiplying the ratio by 1.4 one more time to get a ratio of 3:6.

7 new records * 6 old records/new record = 42 old records

Now, we can divide the total number of old records by 5 to find the number of old records each person brought in:

42 old records / 5 people = 8.4 old records per person

50.4 old records / 5 people = 10.08 old records per person

Since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we can round down to 10 old records per person. However, this would mean that the total number of new records would be 2, which is not possible.

Let's try multiplying the ratio by 1.4 one more time to get a ratio of 3.8:7.6.

7 new records * 7.6 old records/new record = 53.2 old records

Now, we can divide the total number of old records by 5 to find the number of old records each person brought in:

53.2 old records / 5 people = 10.64 old records per person

Since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we can round down to 10 old records per person. However, this would mean that the total number of new records would be 2, which is not possible.

Now, we can divide the total number of old records by 5 to find the number of old records each person brought in:

61.6 old records / 5 people = 12.32 old records per person

Since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we can round down to 12 old records per person. However, this would mean that the total number of new records would be 1.5, which is not possible.

Let's try multiplying the ratio by 1.4 one more time to get a ratio of 4.6:9.2.

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of junior programmers. The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. 

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, the salary of a senior programmer is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers, which is 100 - 40 = 60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately.

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmer
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmer
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

Now, let's add the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers to find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.

Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $208000

"Let's break down the information given:

- At the first bus stop, 5 people got in.
- At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 people got in.
- After the second bus stop, there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop.

We can represent the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'. 

Initially, there were 'x' people on the bus. 
At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total became x + 5.
At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.
Then, 8 people got in, so the total became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that after the second bus stop, there were 20 people heading to the third stop. So, we can set up the equation:
x + 6 = 20

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
x = 20 - 6
x = 14

3. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
4. He eats 3 more lollipops that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
5. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first find out how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

Since the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can find the time it takes to charge 40% by multiplying 40 by 3. 

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 / 60 = 2 hours

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone. 

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to first calculate the total number of lollipops she had after her mother gave her more. 

Erin initially had 7 lollipops. Her mother gave her 10 more, so Erin now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Then, Erin gave 3 lollipops to Ella. To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to subtract 3 from 17. 

17 - 3 = 14

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards they earned from their last shopping trip and apply the coupon.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip, so they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. Since they had 4 rewards, they used $4 off the price. 

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8. 

So, the total discount is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

The customer paid $43 - $12 = $31 on this shopping trip.

Job A's total income is $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000. 
The state tax rate is 20%, so the taxes are $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. 
The net pay for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B, we first need to subtract the property tax from the total income. 
The property tax is $6,000, so the income after property tax is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. 
The state tax rate is 10%, so the taxes are $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. 
The net pay for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs, we subtract the net pay of Job A from the net pay of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of ruined castles, we need to calculate 40% of 220. 

40% of 220 = 0.4 * 220 = 88

Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we need to divide the number of ruined castles by 2.

88 / 2 = 44

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the total cost of each offer, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment.

Furniture United's offer:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Cozy Homes' offer:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two offers:
Cost difference = Total cost of Furniture United's offer - Total cost of Cozy Homes' offer
Cost difference = $3,450 - $3,350
Cost difference = $100

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the shares after the first year and then after the second year.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1 + 0.5 = 1.5).

New price after the first year = $8 * 1.5 = $12.

The stock price decreases by 25% in the second year. To find the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%, or 1 - 0.25 = 0.75).

New price after the second year = $12 * 0.75 = $9.

Now, we multiply the new price after the second year by the number of shares to find the final value of all Maria's shares.

Final value = 8 * $9 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"To find out how many hot dogs each person ate, we need to follow the given information step by step.

Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate 2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we need to subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate. 

3 (John's hot dogs) - 2 (Luke's hot dogs) = 1

"Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the last group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. 

So, we can write the equation: 
x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 
3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 
3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 70

Since the last group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the last group by substituting x = 70 into the expression: 
x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down the information given. Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. 

Let's denote the number of cows as 'c' and the number of chickens as '2c' (since he has twice as many chickens as cows). 

The total number of animals is the sum of the number of cows and chickens, which is c + 2c = 3c. We are given that this sum is 60, so we can write the equation 3c = 60.

To find the value of 'c', we can divide both sides of the equation by 3: c = 60 / 3 = 20. 

So, the number of cows is 20 and the number of chickens is 2c = 2 * 20 = 40.

Chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each. The total number of legs of the chickens is 40 * 2 = 80, and the total number of legs of the cows is 20 * 4 = 80.

The total number of legs of all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's break down Josh's juggling progress:

- Week 1: Josh starts with 3 balls.
- Week 2: He adds 1 ball, so he has 3 + 1 = 4 balls.
- Week 3: He adds 1 more ball, so he has 4 + 1 = 5 balls.
- Week 4: He adds 1 more ball, so he has 5 + 1 = 6 balls.

When Josh walks on stage, he drops 3 balls, but 2 are caught by the crowd. So, he loses 1 ball. 

Josh starts juggling with 6 balls and loses 1, so he has 6 - 1 = 5 balls left."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:

Weight of the pink frog = 50 pounds
Weight of the blue beetle = 50 pounds
Weight of the green toad = 50 pounds
Weight of the yellow snake = 60 pounds
Weight of the red bird = 30 pounds
Weight of the container = 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June, we first need to calculate the new daily distance he needs to run. 

The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. 1/5 of 5000 meters is 5000 / 5 = 1000 meters. 

So, the new daily distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since there are 30 days in June, the total distance covered in June is 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to first calculate how many cookies are used by her son and her husband.

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

In total, 20 + 7 = 27 cookies are used by her son and her husband.

Since there are 36 cookies in a bag, and 27 are used by her son and her husband, Jenny eats the remaining cookies. 

36 - 27 = 9

Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find the total cost of the shirts, we first need to find the discount amount. 

The original price of 2 shirts is 2 * $30 = $60. 
The discount is 40% of $60, which is 0.4 * $60 = $24. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the final cost: $60 - $24 = $36.

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the percentage increase, we first need to find the difference in the amount they make per day now and the amount they used to make per day.

The factory used to make $100 per tractor and sold 10 tractors a day, so they made $100 * 10 = $1000 per day.

Now, they make $220 per silo and sell 5 silos a day, so they make $220 * 5 = $1100 per day.

The difference in the amount they make per day now and the amount they used to make per day is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100:

($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

"To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the total cost per month and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the cost of food per month. Since food costs $25 per week and there are 4 weeks in a month, the cost of food per month is:
$25/week * 4 weeks/month = $100/month

Now, let's add the cost of treats and medicine to the cost of food to get the total cost per month:
$100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost per year is:
$220/month * 12 months/year = $2640/year

She needs 30 plant pots for the daisies. 
She needs twice as many for the roses, which is 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses. 
So, in total, she needs 30 + 60 = 90 plant pots.

April had already bought 100 plant pots from the garden center. 
To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots she needs from the number she already bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

First, let's add the amount she gave her brother to the amount she spent on the sweater to find the total amount she spent: 
$11 (sweater) + $4 (given to brother) = $15

Now, let's subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she had:
$36 (initial amount) - $15 (total spent) = $21

So, Andrea saved $21."
"To find the total time John spent, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them up.

Time spent boating: 6 hours
Time spent swimming: 6 / 2 = 3 hours
Time spent watching shows: 3 shows * 2 hours per show = 6 hours
Total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours

Since the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time, we can set up the equation: 30% * Total time = 6 hours
To find the total time, we can divide both sides by 30% (or 0.3): Total time = 6 / 0.3 = 20 hours

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time: Time spent sightseeing = 40% * 20 hours = 0.4 * 20 = 8 hours

"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the combined height of the two shorter trees. 

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. 
The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

The combined height of the two shorter trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two shorter trees combined, so it is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is 34 feet.

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is $5 per person. Since we don't know the number of friends yet, let's call it 'x'. The total cost for mini-golf will be 1 (Morgan) + x (friends) * $5. 

The cost of arcade tokens is $5. 

The cost of go-karts is $10 per ride, and Morgan and her friends will ride it twice. So, the total cost for go-karts will be 2 * (1 + x) * $10.

The total cost of all activities is the sum of the costs of mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts. 

Total cost = (1 + x) * $5 + $5 + 2 * (1 + x) * $10

Simplifying the equation:
Total cost = $5 + $5x + $5 + $20 + $20x
Total cost = $30 + $25x

We know that Morgan's dad has a budget of $90. So, we can set up the equation:
$30 + $25x = $90

Now, let's solve for x:
$25x = $90 - $30
$25x = $60
x = $60 / $25
x = 2.4

Since we can't invite a fraction of a friend, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can invite 2 friends and still have some money left over."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to first calculate how much money she spends on lollipops each day and then subtract that from her daily pocket money.

1. Billy starts with $10.
2. He buys candy, and we need to find out how many pounds he bought. Let's call the number of pounds 'x'. The cost of the candy is $1.5x.
3. After buying candy, he has $10 - $1.5x left.
4. He takes half of this change, which is ($10 - $1.5x) / 2.
5. He spends this amount on gumballs, which cost $0.05 each. He bought 40 gumballs, so the total cost of gumballs is 40 * $0.05 = $2.
6. The amount he spent on gumballs is equal to half of his change, so ($10 - $1.5x) / 2 = $2.
7. Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: $10 - $1.5x = $4.
8. Subtract $10 from both sides: -$1.5x = -$6.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Carver's age is 45 years. It's mentioned that his age is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. 

Let's represent the son's age as 'x'. 

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. This can be written as an equation: 2x - 5 = 45.

To find the son's age, we need to solve for 'x'. 

First, we add 5 to both sides of the equation: 2x = 45 + 5
This simplifies to: 2x = 50

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 50 / 2
This simplifies to: x = 25

The son is 25 years old.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the three cities. 

Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
Distance from the third city to the first city: 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs)
Total distance in one trip: 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is:
225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles/day

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the distance it travels in a day (675 miles):
18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days

So, the train goes approximately 26.67 days between services."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, four times that many is 4 * 3 = 12. 
   Four times that many minus 5 is 12 - 5 = 7. So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   Since 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting, three times that many is 3 * 7 = 21. 
   So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.

Now, let's add up the number of customers kicked out for each reason:
- Refusing to wear masks: 3
- Shoplifting: 7
- Physical violence over goods on sale: 21

Total number of customers kicked out for these reasons = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31

"Let's break down the information given. Erin now has 14 points and has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points. 

Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can express Erin's points as 3 times Sara's points plus Sara's points. 

Let's represent Sara's points as S. Erin's points can be expressed as 3S + S = 4S. 

We know Erin now has 14 points, so we can set up the equation 4S = 14. 

To find Sara's points, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: S = 14 / 4 = 3.5. 

However, since Sara scored 8 points, we can conclude that the information given is inconsistent. 

But if we assume the question is asking for Erin's points before she scored 14, we can represent Erin's points as E. We know that after scoring 14 points, Erin has 3 times more points than Sara. 

So, E + 14 = 3 * 8. 

E + 14 = 24 

To find Erin's points before, we subtract 14 from both sides of the equation: E = 24 - 14 = 10.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each picture frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors. So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, let's calculate the cost of etching the logo on the picture frames. The etching costs an additional 20% of the cost of each picture frame. 20% of $20 is 0.2 * $20 = $4. So, the total cost of etching the logo on all the picture frames is 44 * $4 = $176.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 1/4 * 44 = 11 officers. Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12. So, the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, let's add up the costs of the picture frames, etching, pins, and cords to find the total cost. $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

"To find the total cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the materials cost first. 

The original price of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

Since making it yourself saves 20%, that means you save 20% of $400. 
20% of $400 = 0.2 * $400 = $80

So, the materials cost is $400 - $80 = $320.

The total cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday, which is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold each day: 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we need to multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold: 50 * 2 = 100.

The final answer is: 100"

"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to find the value of the faulty pieces. 

The total value of the equipment is $400,000. 
40% of the equipment was faulty. 
40% of $400,000 is 0.4 * $400,000 = $160,000.

The value of the faulty pieces is $160,000. 
To find the value of the functioning pieces, we subtract the value of the faulty pieces from the total value: 
$400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000.

The total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

The final answer is: $240,000."
"To find out how much milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from the half of the sheep that gives 1 kg of milk and the half that gives 2 kg of milk.

Half of the 30 sheep is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep. 
These 15 sheep give 1 kg of milk each, so the total milk from them is 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

The other half of the sheep also gives 2 kg of milk each, so the total milk from them is 15 * 2 = 30 kg.

The total milk Mary collects every day is 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her children. 

Mrs. Sherman started with a dozen rolls, which is 12 rolls. She fed 6 children, so she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left.

Since she broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces, we multiply the number of rolls left by 8. 

6 rolls * 8 pieces/roll = 48 pieces

So, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we first need to find the number of pupils who like blue and green.

Half of the class likes blue, so the number of pupils who like blue is 40 / 2 = 20.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20. One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5.

So, the number of pupils who like green is 5.

The number of pupils who like yellow is the total number of pupils minus the number of pupils who like blue and green. This is 40 - 20 - 5 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked each day and add them together.

On Monday, we don't know the number of apples picked, but we know she sold them all for $56 at $4 per apple. So, the number of apples picked on Monday is 56 / 4 = 14.

On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, let's add the number of apples picked each day: 14 + 12 + 24 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many socks Lindsay has washed, we need to calculate the total number of socks from the pairs and the loose socks. 

Since each pair of socks has 2 socks, washing 10 pairs means Lindsay has washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks from the pairs. 

Adding the 15 loose socks, Lindsay has washed a total of 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks that need washing, to find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks that need washing: 50 - 35 = 15.

23 (initial cookies) + 42 (cookies from Janet) = 65 cookies

Now, let's subtract the cookies her brother ate:
65 (total cookies) - 44 (cookies eaten) = 21 cookies

So, there are 21 cookies left for Rachel."
"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest she has to pay and then divide it by the number of months.

The formula to calculate simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Given:
Principal (P) = $3,650
Rate (R) = 10% or 0.10
Time (T) = 5 months

Interest = P * R * T
= $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
= $1,825

Now, we need to add the interest to the principal to find the total amount Karan has to pay:
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
= $3,650 + $1,825
= $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
= $5,475 / 5
= $1,095

The final answer is: $1,095"
"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours, so Cho hiked 14 * 8 = 112 kilometers.

To find out how far Chloe hiked, we need to multiply Chloe's speed by the time she hiked. Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours, so Chloe hiked 9 * 5 = 45 kilometers.

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked than Chloe, we need to subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance. Cho hiked 112 kilometers and Chloe hiked 45 kilometers, so Cho hiked 112 - 45 = 67 kilometers farther.

The final answer is: 67"
"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.

The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

"To find the total profit per hour, we need to first find the total profit for the day and then divide it by the number of hours the stand is open.

Millie buys supplies for $18 to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade, so she makes a total of 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

She sells each cup of lemonade for $1, so the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is 36 * $1 = $36.

The cost of supplies is $18, so the total profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, the stand is open for 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

The profit per hour is $18 / 9 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's call the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially ""x"" hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his land, which is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of female members in the choir, we need to calculate 50% of 52. 
50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

Since half the people performing can't make it to the show, we need to find half of the female members. 
Half of 26 = 26 / 2 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. 
So, the total number of people who sang in the performance = 13 + 3 = 16

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.

First, let's find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

"To find out how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of the rides for Dasha and compare it to the cost of the ride bracelet for David.

Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * $2 = $4.

Since they ride all 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha to buy tickets for all 9 rides is 9 * $4 = $36.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.

The cost for Dasha to ride all 9 rides is $36, and the cost for David to ride all 9 rides is $30. 

The difference in cost is $36 - $30 = $6.

David saves $6 by buying a ride bracelet instead of buying tickets for all 9 rides.

"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to find out how many popsicles each of them has. 

Let's assume the number of popsicles Betty has is 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has is 6x. 

Since the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can write the equation: 5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms: 11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11: x = 15

Now that we know x, we can find the number of popsicles each of them has. Betty has 5x = 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles. Sam has 6x = 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how much Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

The cost of Netflix is $10 a month.

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus each is $10 a month. When bundled, Tim saves 20% on the total cost of the two services. 

First, let's find the total cost of Hulu and Disney Plus without the discount: $10 + $10 = $20.

The discount is 20% of $20, which is 0.2 x $20 = $4.

So, the total cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the discount is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of all the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, he saves $60 - $26 = $34 by cancelling his cable package.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total time spent, we need to add up the time spent writing, recording, and editing the song. 

Time spent writing: 4 hours
Time spent recording: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
Time spent editing: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours

Total time spent = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours

Now, we need to find the percentage of time spent editing. To do this, we'll divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100.

Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%

"To find out how many Valentine's cards Erica has now, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, added to the cards her dad brought, and then subtract the cards she passed out and add the cards she received.

Initially, Erica had 20 Valentine's cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each, so she got 2 * 15 = 30 cards from her dad. 

Now, Erica has 20 (initial cards) + 30 (cards from her dad) = 50 cards.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

She received 17 cards from family and friends.

To find out how many cards Erica has now, we need to subtract the cards she gave away and add the cards she received: 50 (total cards) - 29 (cards given away) + 17 (cards received) = 38.

"To find out how many slices are left, we first need to determine how many slices Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since there are 12 slices, 1/3 of 12 is 12 * (1/3) = 4 slices. 

Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. 1/4 of 12 is 12 * (1/4) = 3 slices.

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so the total number of slices she gave away and ate is 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices given away and eaten from the total number of slices: 12 - 9 = 3 slices.

"To find the energy saved, we first need to find the energy used per day and then subtract the new energy used from the original energy used.

Original energy used per day = 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (or 7.2 kilowatt-hours, since 1 kilowatt-hour = 1000 watts * 1 hour)

New energy used per day = 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours (or 2.7 kilowatt-hours)

Energy saved per day = Original energy used per day - New energy used per day
= 7.2 kilowatt-hours - 2.7 kilowatt-hours
= 4.5 kilowatt-hours

Now, we need to find the total energy saved in 30 days:

"Let's break down the information given:

- Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.
- He also took 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
- After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps.

So, the total steps Elliott took before his jog would be 5,000 (to and from school) + 1,000 (with his friend) = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, the total steps he took would be 10,000 (goal) - 2,000 (left) = 8,000 steps.

Now, to find the steps he took during his jog, we subtract the steps he took before his jog from the total steps he took: 8,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps before jog) = 2,000 steps.

"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. So, the company had 40 - 10 = 30 employees in June. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds and the sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off,"" we can break it down as follows:

- 1 pound at $3
- 1/2 pound at $3/2 = $1.50

So, the total cost of 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. She bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items:

- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashells: $1.50
- Magnets: $1
- Total cost: $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7

"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework separately and then add them together.

The first package of fireworks costs $400. The second package costs twice that much, so it's 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost of the fireworks by 0.20: $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discount amount is subtracted from the total cost of the fireworks: $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150.

The total amount Tim spent is the cost of the fireworks after the discount plus the cost of the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

There are 30 nights in 30 days. 
2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since Shannon's recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make. 

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen cookies

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two conditions.

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50,000 candles smell like wet dog, so we multiply 50,000 by 0.05:

50,000 * 0.05 = 2,500 candles that smell like wet dog

Next, we need to find the number of candles that explode. Since 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, 1% of the candles will explode. We multiply 50,000 by 0.01:

50,000 * 0.01 = 500 candles that explode

However, the candles that smell like wet dog are a subset of the total candles, and the candles that explode are also a subset of the total candles. The candles that both smell like wet dog and explode are a subset of both, so we need to find the intersection of the two sets.

Since we don't have the exact number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we can't directly find the intersection. However, we can use the fact that the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is less than or equal to the smaller of the two numbers.

In this case, the number of candles that explode (500) is less than the number of candles that smell like wet dog (2,500). Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is less than or equal to 500.

However, we can also consider the fact that the candles that smell like wet dog are a subset of the candles that are more dangerous, and the candles that explode are a subset of the total candles. This means that the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is likely to be a small fraction of the total candles.

Since we can't find the exact number, we can make an educated guess that the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is likely to be very small, but we can't provide a specific number.

However, if we assume that the probability of a candle exploding is independent of the probability of it smelling like wet dog, we can use the fact that the probability of both events occurring is the product of the individual probabilities.

The probability of a candle smelling like wet dog is 0.05, and the probability of a candle exploding is 0.01. The probability of both events occurring is:

0.05 * 0.01 = 0.0005

To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we multiply the total number of candles by this probability:

50,000 * 0.0005 = 25

So, the final answer is: 25"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount amount is 30% of the regular price, which is 0.3 x $20 = $6. 

So, the discounted price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 x $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The average trees are not specified, so let's call the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees 'x'.
- The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 45 + x.
- The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.
- The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so 45 + x + 105 = 500.

Now, let's solve for x:
45 + x + 105 = 500
x + 150 = 500
x = 500 - 150
x = 350

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We know that the total number of heads is 180, so we can write the equation:

C + D = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304. Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can write the equation:

2C + D = 304

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve for C and D by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know C, we can substitute it into the first equation to solve for D:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

So, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each part of the trip and add them together.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

In the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 km is:
(30/100) * 800 km = 240 km
So, the total distance traveled in the next two days is 240 km.

In the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each part of the trip:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The final answer is: 3140"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. This means Zack's locker is 4 times as big as Peter's locker.
3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. This means Timothy's locker is twice as big as Zack's locker.

Now, let's calculate the size of Zack's locker:
Zack's locker = 4 * Peter's locker = 4 * 5 = 20 cubic inches

Now, let's calculate the size of Timothy's locker:
Timothy's locker = 2 * Zack's locker = 2 * 20 = 40 cubic inches

"To find the elevation where Stanley's comb fell, we need to subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation. 

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation where the comb fell: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation where the comb fell and Oliver's elevation to determine how much Oliver needs to climb.

Elevation where the comb fell: 6,000 feet
Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

The final answer is: 3000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital. 

The first bank gave him $4000. 

The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

So, the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from the banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Now, let's add the money he received from the banks to his initial capital: $5000 + $12000 = $16000.

The final answer is: $16000"
"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the steps:

1. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20 cats.
   Remaining cats = 50 - 20 = 30 cats.

2. 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran, we need to calculate 3/5 of 30.
   3/5 * 30 = (3 * 30) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18 cats.

3. Now, we need to subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats.
   Cats left on the rock = 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different periods and calculate the cost for each period.

1. The first 6 months cost $8 per month, so the total cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.
2. The next 8 months cost $12 per month, so the total cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.
3. After that, the price increased to $14 per month. Since 2 years is 24 months, and we've already accounted for 14 months, there are 24 - 14 = 10 months left. The cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, let's add up the costs for each period: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The final answer is: $284"

Let the cost of the jogger jeans be x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the cost of the tattered jeans is x + $6.

The total cost of both jeans is $28 + x.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equation:

"Let's break down the information given:

- Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, so she has a total of 6 bird feeders.
- Each bird feeder attracts 20 birds, but the ones she made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones.
- Let's assume the store-bought bird feeders attract x birds. Then, the bird feeders she made herself attract x + 10 birds.

Since there are 3 store-bought bird feeders and 3 homemade bird feeders, the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought bird feeders is 3x, and the total number of birds attracted by the homemade bird feeders is 3(x + 10).

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is the sum of the birds attracted by the store-bought and homemade bird feeders. This can be represented by the equation:

3x + 3(x + 10) = Total number of birds

Combine like terms:

3x + 3x + 30 = 6x + 30

Simplify the equation:

6x + 30 = Total number of birds

Since each bird feeder attracts 20 birds, and the homemade bird feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, we can set up an equation to find the value of x:

x + 10 = 20

Subtract 10 from both sides:

x = 10

Now that we know x, we can find the total number of birds:

6x + 30 = 6(10) + 30
= 60 + 30
= 90

The final answer is: 90"

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how many cards he sold. Since he has $50 in spending cash and the ticket costs $100, he must have sold cards worth $50 to get the remaining $50. 

Since each card is sold for $1.5, the number of cards he sold is $50 / $1.5 = 33.33. However, since you can't sell a fraction of a card, we'll round down to 33 cards.

Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he kept is 1/3 * x, where x is the total number of cards he started with. The number of cards he sold is x - (1/3 * x) = 2/3 * x. We know this equals 33.

2/3 * x = 33
x = 33 * (3/2)
x = 49.5

Since you can't have a fraction of a card, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we'll round down to 49 because we know he sold 33 cards and he kept 1/3 of his cards, so he must have had an odd number of cards to begin with."
"To find out how many guests got a second hotdog, we need to first find out how many guests were expected and how many actually showed up. 

The caterer prepared for 36 guests to have two hotdogs each, so he prepared 36 * 2 = 72 hotdogs. However, he only prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, which means he prepared for 36 / 2 = 18 guests to have two hotdogs. The remaining 36 - 18 = 18 guests were expected to have one hotdog each.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that 40 - 36 = 4 extra guests showed up. Since the caterer only prepared 72 hotdogs, and 36 guests were expected to have two hotdogs, the 4 extra guests would have to take the place of the 4 guests who were originally expected to have one hotdog each.

So, the 4 extra guests took the place of the 4 guests who were originally expected to have one hotdog each. Therefore, the 4 guests who were originally expected to have one hotdog each did not get a second hotdog.

The answer is 4."
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

The total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (her sister) = 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of the 5 separate utensils is 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

To apply the 20% discount, we need to find 20% of $165.00, which is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.

The discount amount is $33.00, so we subtract this from the total cost: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has a total of $2 (her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 (total cost) - $18 (amount she has) = $1.

"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to first find out how many dragons Prince Arthur and Prince Walter slew. 

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, who slew 100 dragons. Three quarters of 100 is 75. 

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so Prince Bruce slew 150 / 5 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to find out how much gas was in each container. 

15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, so each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons of gas.

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, we need to find 1/4 of 3 gallons. 

1/4 of 3 gallons is 3 * 1/4 = 3/4 gallon.

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we need to convert 3/4 gallon to pints. 

3/4 gallon is equal to 3/4 * 8 = 6 pints.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume the total amount of money George had initially is x dollars. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up the equation:

x - 5 = 0.01x

To solve for x, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 5 / (1 - 0.01)
x = 5 / 0.99
x = 5.05

So, George had $5.05 initially.

Since he spent $5, he must have spent 5.05 - 5 = $0.05 on chips.

Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, so the number of bags of chips he bought is:

0.05 / 0.40 = 0.125

Since we can't buy a fraction of a bag of chips, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of candy bars he bought, not chips. 

We know that George spent $0.05 on chips, and he bought 3 bags of chips. So, the total amount he spent on chips is 3 * 0.40 = $1.20. 

The total amount he spent on candy bars is 5 - 1.20 = $3.80.

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is:

3.80 / 0.75 = 5.07

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can round up to the nearest whole number because he must have bought at least 5 candy bars to have any money left over."
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine how many lollipops he shared with his friends. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself, so he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his friends.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among 4 friends, we need to divide the number of lollipops shared by the number of friends: 20 / 4 = 5.

So, each of his friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the remaining weight of the cake, we first need to find out how much the cake weighed after Rory and her mom each had a piece. 

Since there are 8 pieces in total and 2 of them were eaten, 8 - 2 = 6 pieces are left.

Each piece is 20 ounces / 8 = 2.5 ounces.

So, the remaining cake weighs 6 * 2.5 ounces = 15 ounces.

"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to first find the total number of oranges they have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

They are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, including themselves, so the total number of people sharing the oranges is 8.

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people
= 56 / 8
= 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide it by the number of servings.

Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which costs 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we first need to determine how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater. Since it takes four times as long for Bernadette to get to the theater as it does for Wayne, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes, it will take Bernadette 4 * 4 = 16 minutes to get to the theater.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

So, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes earlier than Wayne.

21"
"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. Since the area of the room is given as 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. 

1 yard = 3 feet
So, 3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:
Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula:
Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads they bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Difference in beads = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
= 140 - 60
= 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase due to the oven is 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.

The window is open for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open, so for 30 minutes, it cools down 2 degrees * (30/10) = 6 degrees.

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. The temperature increase due to the oven is 15 degrees, and the temperature decrease due to the open window is 6 degrees. 

So, the final temperature of the house is 40 + 15 - 6 = 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we first need to calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon. 

Jon's total time = 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (1 hour 20 minutes) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes.

We know that James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon. 10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. So, James' swim time is 40 minutes - 4 minutes = 36 minutes.

We also know that James took 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Jon's bike time is 80 minutes, so James' bike time is 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes.

Now, we can find James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time. James' run time = 180 minutes - 36 minutes - 85 minutes = 59 minutes.

The final answer is: 59"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then divide it by 4.

Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so it is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so it is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to calculate the distance it runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, we need to convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 

Distance = Speed * Time = 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to calculate the number of eggs in the cases and add the loose eggs. 

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, so to find out how many glasses Rozanne can make, we divide the total number of eggs by 5. 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to first calculate the total revenue from the flash sale and the sales to the department store.

The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each at the flash sale, so the total revenue from the flash sale is:
17 x $20 = $340

The salesman sold the rest of the sneakers (48 - 17 = 31) to the department store for $25 each, so the total revenue from the department store is:
31 x $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The cost of the case of 48 sneakers is $576. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The salesman's profit is $539."

For the six packets with eight pieces each, the total number of crayons is 6 x 8 = 48.

For the four packets with sixteen pieces each, the total number of crayons is 4 x 16 = 64.

Now, we add the total number of crayons from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

The final answer is: 112"
"Let's break down the information given. 

If you buy a super ticket for $20 and get a popcorn and a soda for $1 extra, the total cost is $21. 

If you buy a regular ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular price, the total cost is $12 + (popcorn price + soda price). 

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of the regular ticket and the snacks is $21 - $2 = $19.

We know the soda costs $3, so the popcorn price can be represented as x. 

The equation for the total cost of the regular ticket and snacks is 12 + x + 3 = 19.

Simplifying the equation, we get x + 15 = 19.

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get x = 4.

The regular price of popcorn is $4. 

The final answer is: $4"
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost of filling one balloon is:

New cost = Original cost + Increase
New cost = 45 + 20
New cost = 65

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new rate:

Cost of filling 170 balloons = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
Cost of filling 170 balloons = 65 * 170
Cost of filling 170 balloons = 11050

The final answer is: 11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 mph x 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 mph x 1 hour
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles
Total Distance = 150 miles

The total time taken is the sum of the time taken at 60 mph and 30 mph:
Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour
Total Time = 3 hours

Now, we can find the average speed:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies separately and then add them together.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires is 8 * $800 = $6400.

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she now has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the 3 sapphires she traded is 3 * $800 = $2400. 

Since she traded 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, the value of the 2 rubies is also $2400.

Now, we need to find the total value of her jewels. The value of the 5 sapphires is $6400, and the value of the 2 rubies is $2400. 

The total value of her jewels is $6400 + $2400 = $8800.

"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost will be 160 * 12 = $1920.

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies that have spots. 
Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 
Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we need to find the percentage of puppies that have spots out of the total number of puppies. 
Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total puppies with spots / Total puppies) * 100

"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and add them together.

The total weight of sugar cubes is 2 boxes * 1 pound per box = 2 pounds.

The total weight of carrots is 4 bags * 12 pounds per bag = 48 pounds.

The total weight of hay is 42 bales * 75 pounds per bale = 3150 pounds.

The total weight of oats is 20 sacks * 65 pounds per sack = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of all the feed is 2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds = 3400 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the weight the truck can carry to find the number of trips needed.

3400 pounds / 2250 pounds per trip = 1.51 trips.

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week. Since an aluminum can is worth 2 cents, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week. Since a plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

In a four-week month, Grayson's total earnings from aluminum cans are 6 * 4 = 24 cents.

In a four-week month, Grayson's total earnings from plastic bottles are 15 * 4 = 60 cents.

Grayson's total earnings from recycling in a four-week month are 24 + 60 = 84 cents.

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we first need to calculate the total number of cards she has. 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

She has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards is the sum of basketball and baseball cards, which is 150 + 200 = 350.

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards, the number of cards she gives to her students is 350 - 50 = 300.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples for Becky: 20 apples * 45 cents = 900 cents. 
Then, subtract the discount: 900 cents - 100 cents = 800 cents. 
Since 100 cents is equal to $1, we can convert 800 cents to dollars: 800 cents / 100 = $8.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the apples for Kelly: 20 apples * 50 cents = 1000 cents. 
Then, calculate the discount: 10% of 1000 cents is 0.1 * 1000 = 100 cents. 
Subtract the discount from the total cost: 1000 cents - 100 cents = 900 cents. 
Since 100 cents is equal to $1, we can convert 900 cents to dollars: 900 cents / 100 = $9.

Now, he has 210 + 30 = 240 shoes.

On Friday, he gains 30 new pairs of shoes, which is 30 x 2 = 60 shoes.

Now, he has 240 + 60 = 300 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.

So, on Sunday, he will have 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake, we first need to determine how many cupcakes she can decorate with the sprinkles she has. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and she has 6 jars, she can decorate 6 * 8 = 48 cupcakes.

Next, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes she needs to bake to have at least 48 cupcakes. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we can divide 48 by 12 to find the number of pans. 

48 / 12 = 4

So, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes. 

The final answer is: 4"

"To find the total number of pencils used, we first need to find the total number of pencils at the beginning of the year. Since there are 30 students and each student started with 10 pencils, the total number of pencils is 30 * 10 = 300.

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. So, the number of pencils used is 1/5 * 300 = 60.

The remaining pencils after two months are 300 - 60 = 240.

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, the number of pencils left is 1/3 * 240 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's break down the problem. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is x. 

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be written as an equation: 

Cookies = (1/2)x + 2

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. So, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we'll subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we'll multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we'll convert the remoras' length from inches to feet. 

1 foot = 12 inches
6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet

There are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. 

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / length of shark) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that 20 students do not have a desktop computer, which is equal to one-fourth of the total number of students.

We can set up the equation: (1/4)x = 20

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate x:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find out how many days Jason has to walk in total, we need to multiply the number of weeks by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week). 

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Now, we need to divide the total number of minutes it takes to break in the shoes by the number of days Jason has to walk.

240 minutes / 21 days = 11.43 minutes per day

So, Jason has to spend approximately 11.43 minutes walking each day to break in the new shoes."
"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first find out how many books Sarah bought in total. 

The total amount spent on books is $300, and each book costs $15. 

To find the total number of books, we divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book: 
300 / 15 = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we need to divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many each child got:
20 / 4 = 5

So each child got 5 books."
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts. 

The number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts can be found by adding the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts, then subtracting the number of kids allergic to both (to avoid double-counting). 

Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts = Number of kids allergic to dairy + Number of kids allergic to peanuts - Number of kids allergic to both
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

Now, we can find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything by subtracting the number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids in the class.

Number of kids not allergic to anything = Total number of kids - Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts
= 32 - 12

There are 3 groups of 200 employees, so the total number of employees is 3 x 200 = 600.

Each group has 7 tour guides, and there are 3 groups, so the total number of tour guides is 3 x 7 = 21.

The total number of people going on the tour is 600 (employees) + 21 (tour guides) = 621.

The final answer is: 621"
"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal, so the new price is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

"Let's break down the information given:

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint.

Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the number of blue and yellow tubes: 2 (blue) + 9 (yellow) = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the weight of the 2010 penny, we need to calculate three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. 

Three-quarters of 48 grains is 3/4 * 48 = 36 grains.

"To find out how many songs Luri has, we need to multiply the number of songs Gabriel has by 3. 

Gabriel has 20 songs, and Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. 
Luri has 20 * 3 = 60 songs.

Now, we need to find out how many more songs Luri can add to his player than Gabriel. 
The maximum capacity of the player is 100 songs. 
Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs to his player. 
Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs to his player.

"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to first find out how many oranges he ate. 

They picked 60 oranges and Stetson ate 2/5 of them. 

2/5 of 60 = (2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. 

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange he ate, the total amount of money he gave up is 24 * 10 = $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

3 times the cost of her shoes = 3 * $80 = $240

Since her handbag cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes, we need to subtract $20 from the result.

Cost of handbag = 3 times the cost of her shoes - $20
= $240 - $20
= $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to first find out how many miles he runs in a week. 

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so we multiply the miles he runs per day by the number of days he runs per week: 
12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Since James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can find out how many hours he runs per week by dividing the total miles he runs per week by his speed:
60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day. 

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day. So, each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

For five days, the total amount of oats consumed is 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, the number of bags needed is 200 / 50 = 4.

"To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon.

Since the razors are buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Heather also has a $2.00 coupon, so she will get a discount of $2.00.

The total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to divide the total cost by the number of razors: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

"Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, the number of insects David found is B/2. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so the number of insects Lily found is B/2 + 7.

We are also given that together they collected 43 insects. So, the sum of the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. 

We can write the equation as: B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms: B + B = 2B, and 2B/2 = B. So the equation becomes: 2B + B + 7 = 43

Combine like terms: 3B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3B = 36

Divide both sides by 3: B = 12

Now that we know Bodhi found 12 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: B/2 = 12/2 = 6

And the number of insects Lily found is B/2 + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13

- Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.
- 2 packs are strawberry gum.
- 1 pack is grape gum, which costs $2.
- 1 pack is green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum, so it costs $2 / 2 = $1.
- The total cost of all the gum is $7.

We know that the total cost of the 3 non-strawberry packs is $2 (grape) + $1 (green apple) = $3. 

Since the total cost of all the gum is $7, the cost of the 2 strawberry packs is $7 - $3 = $4.

To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we divide the total cost of the strawberry packs by 2: $4 / 2 = $2.

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar and then calculate how many of that type of wood he can buy with his budget.

A 2 x 4 gives 200 sticks and costs $4, so the number of sticks per dollar is 200 / 4 = 50 sticks per dollar.
A 2 x 8 gives 400 sticks and costs $6, so the number of sticks per dollar is 400 / 6 = 66.67 sticks per dollar.

Since 2 x 8 gives more sticks per dollar, we will calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with his budget. 

He has $24, so he can buy 24 / 6 = 4 2 x 8 pieces of wood.

So, the total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought is 4x, and this is equal to 12 (onions) + 4 (potatoes) = 16. 

Now, we can set up the equation 4x = 16 to find the value of x. 

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 16 / 4 = 4.

Since x represents the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 4 (onions) + 4 (potatoes) = 8.

Let the cost of the lot be x. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. We can write an equation to represent this:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

The total cost is the cost of the canvas bags, which is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack * $4 per bag = 8 * 5 * 4 = $160.

The total revenue is the selling price of the bags, which is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $64 - $160 = -$96. However, since profit cannot be negative, it seems there is an error in the problem. 

However, if we assume that the problem is asking for the profit per bag, then the profit per bag is ($8 - $4) = $4 per bag. The total profit would be 8 bags * $4 per bag = $32.

If we assume that the problem is asking for the profit, then the answer is $32."
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total number of minutes in the fight and then multiply it by the average number of punches he throws per minute.

There are 5 rounds of 3 minutes each, so the total number of minutes is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, the total number of punches he threw is 15 * 25 = 375 punches.

The final answer is: 375"
"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, Josh made 36 / 4 = 9 cookies.

Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, so we multiply the number of cookies Josh made by 2. Kelsie made 9 * 2 = 18 cookies.

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. 
   Total money = (4 * $10) + (6 * $20) 
   Total money = $40 + $120 
   Total money = $160

2. Ali gives his sister half of the total money. 
   Half of the total money = $160 / 2 
   Half of the total money = $80

3. Now, Ali has the remaining money after giving his sister half of it. 
   Remaining money = Total money - Half of the total money 
   Remaining money = $160 - $80 
   Remaining money = $80

4. Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner. 
   Money used for dinner = (3/5) * Remaining money 
   Money used for dinner = (3/5) * $80 
   Money used for dinner = $48

5. Now, we need to find the amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner. 
   Money left after dinner = Remaining money - Money used for dinner 
   Money left after dinner = $80 - $48 
   Money left after dinner = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house. We need to convert this to minutes because the time taken by Royce is given in minutes. 

1 hour = 60 minutes
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes

Now, we are given that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time taken by Rob. 

Time taken by Rob = 120 minutes
Double the time taken by Rob = 2 * 120 = 240 minutes
Time taken by Royce = 240 + 40 = 280 minutes

- 1 skein for a pair of mittens
- 2 skeins for a pair of socks

Total for each child: 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 19 skeins

Since there are 3 children, we multiply the total for one child by 3:
19 skeins * 3 = 57 skeins

So, Martha will need to buy 57 skeins of wool."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Chris starts with 100 math problems to complete.

On Monday, he completes 12 problems, so he has 100 - 12 = 88 problems left.

On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems. So, he now has 88 - 36 = 52 problems left.

On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 1/4 * 52 = 13 problems. So, he now has 52 - 13 = 39 problems left.

Therefore, Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday.

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to find the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour and add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Now, let's add the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29.

"To find the number of rows of red tulips, we need to divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row. 

36 red tulips / 6 tulips per row = 6 rows of red tulips

To find the number of rows of blue tulips, we need to divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

24 blue tulips / 8 tulips per row = 3 rows of blue tulips

Since Jackson can plant both red and blue tulips in the same row, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of rows of red and blue tulips to determine the total number of rows. 

The LCM of 6 and 3 is 6.

Therefore, Jackson will plant 6 rows of flowers."
"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to first determine how many cups of raisins she has available for the cookies. 

Since she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, she will have 1/3 of the raisins for the cookies. 

1/3 of 27 cups is 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins for the cookies.

Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we need to divide the total cups of raisins available for the cookies by 3/4 to find out how many batches she can make.

9 cups / (3/4) = 9 / (3/4) = 9 * (4/3) = 12

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption is 12 * 24 = 288 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day. 

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. Her daily consumption will be 14 * 24 = 336 kWh per day.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. 

Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly consumption is 288 * 7 = 2016 kWh. 

After adding the new device, her weekly consumption is 336 * 7 = 2352 kWh.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kWh. 

Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly bill is 2016 * $1.50 = $3024.

After adding the new device, Ada's weekly bill is 2352 * $1.50 = $3528.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $3528 - $3024 = $504.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many days it would take for one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take them twice as long to paint a whole house, which is 5 * 2 = 10 days.

Since one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, we need to find out how many days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house. If one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, then 5 people can paint a whole house in 10 / 5 = 2 days.

Now, we need to convert the number of days into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 2 days would be 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:
Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so she has 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture.
Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so she has 64 + 66 = 130 pieces of furniture.
The total number of sofas and chairs they have is 42 + 130 = 172.

"Let's break down the information given. Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set for an unknown price. The total cost was $48. 

Let's denote the price of the headphone set as 'x'. We can set up the equation:

4 + x = 48

To find the price of the headphone set, we need to subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

x = 48 - 4
x = 44

So, the price of the headphone set is $44.

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he had not bought the headphone set. He had $48 left after buying the CD. 

Number of CDs = Total money / Price of one CD
= 48 / 4
= 12

If he had not bought the headphone set, he would have had $44 left. 

Number of CDs = Total money / Price of one CD
= 44 / 4
= 11

To find out how many more CDs he could have bought, we need to subtract the number of CDs he could have bought with $44 from the number of CDs he could have bought with $48:

Number of additional CDs = 12 - 11
= 1

6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

For the weeks where he spent 5 hours, there are 2 weeks.
2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

For the week where he spent 6 hours, there is 1 week.

"To find the number of passengers after the second stop, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus, so 5 * 8 = 40 people get in. 
Now, the total number of passengers is:
40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 3 times 21 is 63, but since it's 3 times fewer, we subtract 63 from 21 to get the number of passengers who got in, which is 21 - 63 = -42. However, since you can't have a negative number of passengers, this means that 63 is 3 times more than the number of passengers who got in. So, we need to divide 63 by 3 to get the number of passengers who got in, which is 21. 

Now, the total number of passengers is:
59 (left) + 21 (got in) = 80

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.
   Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years.
   So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.
3. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, let's find the difference in their current ages: 
Current age of Jame = 22 years
Current age of his cousin = 47 years
Difference in their ages = 47 - 22 = 25 years

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
2. The computer costs $1,100.
3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer.

First, let's find the cost of the printer. Since the printer costs $400 less than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer:
Printer cost = Computer cost - $400
Printer cost = $1,100 - $400
Printer cost = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, printer, and 2 monitors is $2,400. We can subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total to find the cost of the 2 monitors:
Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - (Computer cost + Printer cost)
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - ($1,100 + $700)
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,800
Cost of 2 monitors = $600

Since we want to find the cost of one monitor, we divide the cost of 2 monitors by 2:
Cost of 1 monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
Cost of 1 monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of 1 monitor = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we first need to find out how many seashells the girls brought in total. 

Since there are 20 kids in total and they were divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls. 

The boys brought 60 shells each, so the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 60 shells.

First, we calculate 4 * 60 = 240. 

Then, we add 600 + 240 = 840.

So, the total number of shells brought by the girls is 840.

Since there are 10 girls, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by 10 to find out how many shells each girl brought: 840 / 10 = 84.

Now, George ate 5 candies, so he has 3 candies left. This means that before eating 5 candies, George had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

Since George had 'x' candies initially, we can set up the equation: x = 8.

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find out how many candies Nick had. Nick had twice as many candies as George, so Nick had 2x = 2(8) = 16 candies.

Emma made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

Total vlogs made so far = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Total vlogs Emma aims to make = 72

Vlogs Emma needs to make = Total vlogs she aims to make - Total vlogs made so far

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much money the eldest boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we divide $18 by 3 to find the initial share of the eldest boy.

Initial share of the eldest boy = $18 / 3 = $6

2. The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so we add $5 to the initial share.

New amount after adding $5 = $6 + $5 = $11

3. The following day, he added another $10 to his share.

New amount after adding $10 = $11 + $10 = $21

4. He then spent $8 from his total, so we subtract $8 from the new amount.

Amount after spending $8 = $21 - $8 = $13

5. He saved some more and tripled the amount he had left after spending $8. To triple the amount, we multiply $13 by 3.

Final amount = $13 * 3 = $39

So, the eldest boy has $39 now."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of April is x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half will also be 30 - x.

Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. If he saves y dollars in the first half, he will save 2y dollars in the second half.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first and second half, which is equal to the target of $1125. 

So, we can write the equation: x*y + (30 - x)*2y = 1125

We can simplify the equation by distributing 2y: xy + 60y - 2xy = 1125

Combine like terms: -xy + 60y = 1125

Factor out y: y(-x + 60) = 1125

Divide both sides by (-x + 60): y = 1125 / (-x + 60)

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, we need to find the value of y. However, we don't know the value of x. We can use the fact that the total number of days in April is 30. 

Let's try to find a value of x that makes the equation solvable. If x = 15, then the number of days in the second half is also 15. 

Substitute x = 15 into the equation: y = 1125 / (15 + 60)
y = 1125 / 75
y = 15

Now that we have the value of y, we can find the value of 2y, which is the amount Elvis needs to save in the second half. 

2y = 2 * 15
2y = 30

Twice the time it takes to swim a mile in cold water is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes.
2 minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold water and 3 miles in warm water.

In cold water, it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile. So, to swim 3 miles, it will take him 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

In warm water, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile. So, to swim 3 miles, it will take him 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

Now, let's find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and 3 miles in cold water.

The difference is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then divide the target savings by his weekly earnings.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day. So, his daily earnings are:
$2/hour * 5 hours/day = $10/day

Since he works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings are:
$10/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

Now, we can divide the target savings by his weekly earnings to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80:
$80 / $40/week = 2 weeks

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."
"To find the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, we need to multiply the cost of the foot-long fish sub by 3. 

Cost of the foot-long fish sub: $40
Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub: $40 * 3 = $120

Now, we need to add the cost of both subs to find the total cost of lunch.

Total cost = Cost of the foot-long fish sub + Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub
Total cost = $40 + $120
Total cost = $160

The final answer is: $160"
"To find the total number of holes, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

There are 7 buttons with 2 holes each, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

There are 21 - 7 = 14 buttons with 4 holes each, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 14 * 4 = 56.

The total number of holes in all the buttons is 14 + 56 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to find the size of Zack's locker first, and then find half of that size.

Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so Zack's locker is 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches.

Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so Peter's locker is 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the information given:

Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. 
Since we don't know the daily recommended cups, let's call it 'x'. 
So, Octavia drinks x/2 cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, which is 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. 
So, Juan needs to reduce his current coffee intake of 5x cups to 4 cups.

To find out how many cups Juan needs to reduce, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake: 
5x - 4.

However, we still don't know the value of 'x'. To find the answer, we need to know the daily recommended cups of coffee. 

Since the question asks for the reduction in cups, we can express the reduction in terms of 'x'. 
The reduction is 5x - 4 cups.

However, we can't provide a numerical answer without knowing the value of 'x'. But, we can express the reduction in terms of 'x'. 

If we assume the daily recommended cups of coffee is 2 (since Octavia drinks half of it), then x = 2. 
So, the reduction would be 5x - 4 = 5(2) - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 cups.

But, this is an assumption. The actual reduction depends on the daily recommended cups of coffee, which is not given in the question.

However, if we consider the general case, the reduction is 5x - 4 cups.

But, since the question asks for a numerical answer, we will assume the daily recommended cups of coffee is 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find the total number of rodents, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

The pet shop has 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is 3 * 10 = 30.

The pet shop has 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, we add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents: 30 + 15 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the average weight of the 3 friends, we need to first find their individual weights. 

Mark weighs 150 pounds. 
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we need to find the average weight of the 3 friends. To do this, we add their weights and divide by 3. 
Average weight = (150 + 130 + 260) / 3 
Average weight = 540 / 3 
Average weight = 180 

The final answer is: 180"
"To find the final angle from the ground to the sun, we need to add the initial angle of the pyramid to the angle the sun moves in 10 hours.

The sun moves 5 degrees per hour, so in 10 hours, it will move 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

The initial angle of the pyramid is 32 degrees. 

So, the final angle from the ground to the sun will be 32 + 50 = 82 degrees.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of candles he needs. Since one son is 12 and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Typically, birthday candles are one per year of age, so James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed by the number of candles per pack: 20 / 5 = 4.

Since James needs 4 packs of candles and each pack costs $3, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 4 * 3 = 12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week and then convert that to pages. 

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we need to find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which is 105 / 1.5 = 70.

Now that we know there are 70 intervals of 1.5 minutes, and she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we multiply 70 by 2 to find out how many pages she read in the first week. 70 * 2 = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we add the pages she read in the first week to the pages she read in the second week. 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"To find out how many sandwiches Cody ate, we need to calculate a third of 12. A third of 12 is 12 / 3 = 4. 

To find out how many sandwiches Trevor ate, we need to calculate a quarter of 12. A quarter of 12 is 12 / 4 = 3.

Now, let's add the number of sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate. 4 (Cody) + 3 (Trevor) = 7 sandwiches.

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the initial number of sandwiches. 12 (initial sandwiches) - 7 (eaten sandwiches) = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let the nephew's current age be x. 

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be 44 + 7 = 51 years. 
In 7 years, the nephew's age will be x + 7. 

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. 
So, we can set up the equation: 51 = 3(x + 7). 

Now, let's solve for x. 
51 = 3x + 21 
51 - 21 = 3x 
30 = 3x 
x = 30 / 3 
x = 10 

So, the nephew is 10 years old today.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to calculate the amount for each set of teeth and add them together.

For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left $5.00.

For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00 each, so that's 3 x $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, for the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left 2 x $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

1. Richie scored 80 goals.
2. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.
   So, Mark scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals.
3. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna.
   So, Anna scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals.

Now, let's add up the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:
Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: $21"
"To find out how many action figures Peter will buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he spent on wooden action figures and plastic action figures separately.

From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day on wooden action figures. Since there are 4 days in this period, he spent a total of 4 x $5 = $20 on wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), Peter will spend $2 each day on plastic action figures. Since there are 4 days in this period, he will spend a total of 4 x $2 = $8 on plastic action figures.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Peter spent on action figures. He spent $20 on wooden action figures and $8 on plastic action figures, so the total amount spent is $20 + $8 = $28.

Since Peter started with $70 and spent $28, he has $70 - $28 = $42 left. 

Since the wooden action figures cost $5 each and the plastic action figures cost $2 each, we can calculate the number of action figures he bought as follows:

Number of wooden action figures = $20 / $5 = 4
Number of plastic action figures = $8 / $2 = 4

Total number of action figures = 4 (wooden) + 4 (plastic) = 8

The final answer is: 8"

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200.
The cost of the vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60.
The cost of the broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The final answer is: $308"
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 - 160 = 100.

"To find out how much money will be remaining in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she will remove from the account in 2 years and subtract that from the initial amount.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 x 12 = 24 months.

Katina removes $100 from the account every month, so in 24 months, she will remove 24 x $100 = $2400.

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her account.

The final answer is: $600"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. So, the cost of bread for 1 sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30. 

The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00. So, the cost of cheese and condiments for 1 sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00.

The total cost for 1 sandwich is $0.30 (bread) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $3.30.

The revenue from selling 1 sandwich is $7.00.

The net profit for 1 sandwich is $7.00 (revenue) - $3.30 (cost) = $3.70.

The net profit for 10 sandwiches is $3.70 * 10 = $37.00.

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to first find out how many muffin crayons she can make. 

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together in each muffin tin, and there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we need to find out how many small pieces of crayons there are in total. 

There are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, so there are 3 * 64 = 192 small pieces of crayons.

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together in each muffin tin, we need to divide the total number of small pieces of crayons by 8 to find out how many muffin crayons she can make. 

192 / 8 = 24 muffin crayons.

Now that we know Kate can make 24 muffin crayons, we can find out how much money she can make by multiplying the number of muffin crayons by the price of each muffin crayon. 

24 * $1.50 = $36.

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide by the number of days.

On days one and two, Mack saw 50 birds. 
On days four and five, Mack saw 120 birds. 
On day six, Mack saw 20 birds. 
On day seven, Mack saw 90 birds.

First, let's add up the total number of birds Mack saw on days one and two: 50 + 50 = 100
Then, let's add up the total number of birds Mack saw on days four and five: 120 + 120 = 240
Now, let's add up the total number of birds Mack saw on days one, two, four, five, six, and seven: 100 + 240 + 20 + 90 = 450

"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to find the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference between the actual and set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.

The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4% for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% higher than 520 degrees.

To do this, we can multiply 520 by 1.04 (which is 100% + 4%).

520 * 1.04 = 540.8

So, Maggie should set her oven to 541 degrees."
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to add the length of each movie in minutes. 

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the hour to minutes by multiplying 1 by 60, which equals 60 minutes. Adding the 30 minutes, the first movie is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes long.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the hours to minutes, 2 hours is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes. Adding the 5 minutes, the second movie is 120 + 5 = 125 minutes long.

Now, we add the length of both movies: 90 minutes (first movie) + 125 minutes (second movie) = 215 minutes.

Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
= $76,000 - $22,800
= $53,200

Now, we need to find the combined value of the two houses.
Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price

"To find the total number of contacts, we multiply the number of contacts in one box by the number of boxes Pete buys: 90 contacts/box * 2 boxes = 180 contacts.

Since the contacts will last Pete 45 days, we can find the number of contacts he uses per day: 90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts/day.

To find the total number of days the contacts will last, we multiply the number of contacts by the number of contacts used per day: 180 contacts / 2 contacts/day = 90 days.

Since the contacts will last 90 days, Pete only needs to buy 1 box of contacts, not 2. However, we will continue with the original plan to find the cost per pair of contacts.

The discount is 10% off the original price of $100.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $100.00 * 0.10 = $10.00.

To find the discounted price, we subtract the discount from the original price: $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is $90.00 * 2 = $180.00.

To find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts: $180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact.

Since there are 2 contacts in a pair, the cost per pair of contacts is $1.00 * 2 = $2.00."

"To find out how many calories Hannah burns in total, we need to calculate the calories burned during aerobics and running. 

Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times 100 ml is needed.

Total calories burned: 1600
Divide by 200: 1600 / 200 = 8

So, Hannah needs to drink 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water.

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. 

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans) and G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans).

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3.01B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3.01:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485

And the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

"To find the total number of people attending, we need to break down the information given.

Initially, Alex invites 100 people via email. Each of these 100 people will invite 2 friends, so the total number of people invited by them is 100 * 2 = 200.

Then, Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them say they will bring their spouses. This means 8 couples will be attending, which is 8 * 2 = 16 people.

Now, we add the people invited via email (including their friends), the people invited by phone (including their spouses), and Alex herself. 

Total people = 100 (initially invited) + 200 (friends of the initially invited) + 16 (spouses of the friends invited by phone) + 10 (friends invited by phone) + 1 (Alex herself) = 327

eBay cost = $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping) = $21

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to subtract the Amazon cost from the eBay cost.

Difference = eBay cost - Amazon cost = $21 - $20 = $1

The boots work out to be $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet off the ground. The beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall and doubles in height every day.

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we first need to find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Jerry's current age be x.

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can write an equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown, and then subtract the deposit he has already paid.

The base price of each implant is $2000, and he needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

He wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

He has already paid a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since he makes $15 per hour at work, to find out how many hours he needs to work to pay for the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it can be represented as 2x. 
And since one angle is three times the smallest angle, it can be represented as 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. 
One angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees.
The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

8 quarters = 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
6 dimes = 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

Total amount of money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball
= 345 cents / 5 cents
= 69

The final answer is: 69"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%, we first need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds. 

So, the weight he increases the 8-pound weight by is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

Since it's too heavy, he uses a weight two pounds lighter than that, which is 12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, which is 12 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 12 = 22 games at the end of the first year.

In the second year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, for a total of 5 games. He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, which is 24 games. So, in total, he has 5 + 24 = 29 games at the end of the second year.

In the third year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, for a total of 5 games. He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games. So, in total, he has 5 + 48 = 53 games at the end of the third year.

Now, let's add up the total number of games Steve has at the end of the third year: 22 (from the first year) + 29 (from the second year) + 53 (from the third year) = 104 games.

The final answer is: 104"
"To find the rate of the plane, we need to divide the distance it traveled by the time it took. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it would take the plane 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to first find out how many pounds Ruiz makes in an hour. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how many pounds he makes in an hour, we divide 120 by 2. 

120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour for Ruiz.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour. To find out how many pounds Marissa makes in an hour, we multiply 60 by 3/4.

60 * (3/4) = 45 pounds per hour for Marissa.

Now, we know that Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour and Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour. They both work for 12 hours a day. 

To find the total amount of chocolates they make in a day, we multiply the pounds each of them makes in an hour by the number of hours they work and add the results together.

Ruiz's total: 60 * 12 = 720 pounds
Marissa's total: 45 * 12 = 540 pounds

Total amount of chocolates they make together: 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: 1260"

"To find out how many times the tires rotate in a month, we need to multiply the number of miles driven per month by the number of rotations per mile. 

Rotations per month = 400 miles/month * 725 rotations/mile = 290,000 rotations/month

Now, we need to find out how many months the tires can last before they need to be replaced. 

Total rotations allowed = 10,440,000 rotations
Rotations per month = 290,000 rotations/month

Months before replacement = Total rotations allowed / Rotations per month
Months before replacement = 10,440,000 / 290,000
Months before replacement = 36

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find the number of years by dividing the total months by 12.

Years before replacement = Months before replacement / 12
Years before replacement = 36 / 12
Years before replacement = 3

"To find out how much Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3). The discount amount is $60 * 0.3 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost of the items. $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional tax to the final cost.

Finally, we subtract the final cost from the initial amount of money Joe has. $50 - $42 = $8.

"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7:

4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we multiply 28 dozen by 12 to get the total number of croissants:

28 dozen * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we know it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how much butter is needed for 336 croissants, we multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen:

336 croissants * (1/4 pound/croissant) = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

The profit from selling the cars is the selling price minus the cost to acquire them:
Profit = Selling price - Cost to acquire
Profit = $250,000 - $75,000
Profit = $175,000

James got a 10% commission on the profit:
Commission = Profit * 0.1
Commission = $175,000 * 0.1

"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to find the price of the gold and silver jewels first.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

Given that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400

= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
- He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.
- He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps together:

16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to determine the relative speed between them. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since speed can't be negative, we need to take the absolute value of the relative speed.

Relative speed = | -15 mph | = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

The distance Tom needs to cover to catch up with Bob is the initial distance between them, which is 75 miles.

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob. 

The final answer is: 5"

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's assume Manny misses x classes. Since there are 10 total classes, he will attend 10 - x classes.

The total cost of the classes he attends is $60, and the cost per class is $10. So, the total cost of the classes he attends is 10 * 10 = $100. However, the total cost of the classes he attends is also 10 - x * 10.

Since the total cost of the classes he attends is $60, we can set up the equation:

(10 - x) * 10 = 60

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10:

10 - x = 6

Now, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

-x = -4

Multiplying both sides of the equation by -1:

x = 4

So, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total weekly production, we first need to determine how many customers each of them can process in a week. 

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jewel's weekly production is 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day. Julie's weekly production is 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for the two is 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to first determine how many miles Reggie ran. We know Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, and Paisley ran 4 miles. 

So, Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

We also know Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. This means Reggie's distance minus 3 miles is equal to Lynn's distance. 

So, Lynn's distance = Reggie's distance - 3 miles
Lynn's distance = 20 - 3
Lynn's distance = 17 miles

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the cost of 5 apples, we need to first find the cost of one apple. 

Cost of 4 apples = $5.20
Cost of 1 apple = $5.20 / 4 = $1.30

Now, we can find the cost of 5 apples.
Cost of 5 apples = $1.30 * 5 = $6.50

To find the cost of 5 oranges, we need to first find the cost of one orange.

Cost of 3 oranges = $3.30
Cost of 1 orange = $3.30 / 3 = $1.10

Now, we can find the cost of 5 oranges.
Cost of 5 oranges = $1.10 * 5 = $5.50

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges.
Total cost = Cost of 5 apples + Cost of 5 oranges
Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50
Total cost = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the features and the base price:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

"To find out how much Tim will make in a year, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary:
5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Next, let's calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary:
Bonus = $20,000 / 2 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly income:
Total monthly income = New monthly salary + Bonus = $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

Finally, let's calculate the total annual income:

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then subtract the two amounts.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got a $2 discount. So, the total cost is:
20 * $20 = $400
$400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price of each pomegranate is $30, and there's a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost is:
20 * $30 = $600
10% of $600 is 0.1 * $600 = $60

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first month, Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Let's call the total sales from green hats in the first month 'x'. Then, the sales from red hats in the first month is $400, which is half of 'x', so we can write the equation as:

400 = x/2

To find the value of 'x', we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 400 * 2
x = 800

So, the total sales from green hats in the first month is $800.

Now, we know that the total sales in the first month is the sum of sales from red and green hats:

Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
= $400 + $800
= $1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month is:

Sales in the second month = 3/4 * Total sales in the first month
= 3/4 * $1200
= $900

Now, we need to find the total sales in two months. We add the sales of the first and second months:

Total sales in two months = Sales in the first month + Sales in the second month
= $1200 + $900
= $2100

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves make up a dozen eggs. 

1 dozen eggs = 12 eggs
1 dozen eggs = 2 * 6 deviled egg halves (since 1 egg makes 2 deviled egg halves)
1 dozen eggs = 12 deviled egg halves

Now, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs to make 48 deviled egg halves.

48 deviled egg halves / 12 deviled egg halves per dozen = 4 dozens

"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can set up the equation for the total number of legs: 4S + 2G = 70.

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, which means S + G = 20.

We can solve the second equation for G: G = 20 - S.

Now, substitute G in the first equation: 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

Expand the equation: 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

To find Sally's books, we need to isolate Sally's books on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation: 21 - 3 = 2 * Sally's books + 3 - 3.

This simplifies to: 18 = 2 * Sally's books.

To find Sally's books, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2: Sally's books = 18 / 2.

3. When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs.
   Total dogs now: 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (new dogs) + 16 (additional dogs) = 28 dogs
   Total toys needed so far: 12 (initial toys) + 16 (additional dogs) = 28 toys
4. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys.
   Total toys needed: 28 (total toys needed so far) - 3 (toys no longer needed) = 25 toys

However, we need to consider that James initially had 4 toys for 4 dogs, but he bought more toys for the additional dogs. So, the initial 4 toys are still available. 
Total toys needed: 25 (toys needed after the last visit) + 4 (initial toys) = 29 toys

The final answer is: 29"
"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to calculate the remaining amount after Dylan and Frances invested.

Dylan's investment is 2/5 of the total amount, which is 2/5 * $1200 = $480.

The remaining amount after Dylan's investment is $1200 - $480 = $720.

Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is 2/3 * $720 = $480.

The remaining amount after Frances' investment is $720 - $480 = $240.

So, Skyler's investment is $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we first need to determine how many signatures they currently have in total. 

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 

Total signatures = Carol's signatures + Jennifer's signatures
Total signatures = 20 + 44
Total signatures = 64

Since they want to reach 100 signatures by the end of the summer, we need to find out how many more signatures they need to collect.

Signatures needed = Total signatures they want - Total signatures they currently have
Signatures needed = 100 - 64
Signatures needed = 36

They have three more weeks of summer vacation, and they need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to find out how much she earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Karen works in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, in two days she works 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can find out how much Karen earns in two days by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works: $20 * 6 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a ratio of potatoes to hash browns as follows: 

6 potatoes : 36 hash browns

To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we can set up a proportion:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

6x = 96 * 36

6x = 3456

Now, we can divide both sides by 6 to find x:

x = 3456 / 6
x = 576

So, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

576"
"To find out how much the group of adults will weigh, we need to multiply the number of adults by their average weight. 

Number of adults = 8
Average weight per adult = 80 kg

Total weight of adults = Number of adults * Average weight per adult
Total weight of adults = 8 * 80
Total weight of adults = 640 kg

Now, we need to find out how much they will exceed the maximum load of the elevator. 

Maximum load of the elevator = 700 kg
Total weight of adults = 640 kg

Excess weight = Maximum load of the elevator - Total weight of adults
Excess weight = 700 - 640
Excess weight = 60 kg

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, but we don't know how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. However, we can express the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as x. So, Max has x + 12 cookies.
4. Since Max has 73 cookies, we can set up the equation x + 12 = 73 to find the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
5. Solving the equation, we get x = 73 - 12 = 61 cookies for the Cookie Monster.
6. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.
7. To find the total number of cookies, we add the number of cookies each person has: 68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = 298.

The final answer is: 298"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let the original length of the dress be x cm. 

Since Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, the new length after extension is x + 0.5x = 1.5x cm.

Then, she adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress, so the final length is 1.5x + 20 cm.

We are given that the final design is 140cm long, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 140 - 20
1.5x = 120

Next, divide both sides of the equation by 1.5:

x = 120 / 1.5
x = 80

"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took for each mode and then add them together.

Time in turtle mode: 1 hour = 60 minutes
Time in rabbit mode: 40 minutes

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to multiply the time for each mode by 0.5 (half).

Time in turtle mode: 60 minutes * 0.5 = 30 minutes
Time in rabbit mode: 40 minutes * 0.5 = 20 minutes

Now, we add the time for both modes to get the total time.

Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time it takes to get to the fire station from the total time they have. 

Total time they have = 30 minutes
Time to get to the fire station = 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Time left to get to school = Total time they have - Time to get to the fire station
Time left to get to school = 30 minutes - 19 minutes
Time left to get to school = 11 minutes

So, they have 11 minutes to get to school without being late."

"To find out how many cookies are in the box, we first need to determine the total number of cookies baked by Greta and Celinda. 

Greta bakes 30 cookies. 
Celinda bakes twice as many as Greta, so she bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies is 30 (Greta's cookies) + 60 (Celinda's cookies) = 90 cookies.

They eat 10 cookies, so the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. 

Since there are two twins and one triplet, the total age is 2T + t. We are given that their combined ages are 44, so we can write the equation: 2T + t = 44.

We also know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write another equation: T = t + 7.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one: 2(t + 7) + t = 44.

Expanding the equation, we get: 2t + 14 + t = 44.

Combine like terms: 3t + 14 = 44.

Subtract 14 from both sides: 3t = 30.

Divide both sides by 3: t = 10.

Now that we know the age of the triplet, we can find the age of the older twin: T = t + 7 = 10 + 7 = 17.

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

The total cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2. 

The total cost of 5 lollipops and 4 candies is $3.20, so the cost of 4 candies is $3.20 - $2 = $1.20. 

The cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops, which is 10 * $0.40 = $4.

The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4 + $3 = $7.

"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year) and 10 (the number of years).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year = 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year = 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings = 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings = 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

Now, let's add their total savings to find out how many coins they have after 10 years:

"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, but we don't know the total bill yet. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

The price for such a crate of fruit is $32."
"To find the total number of squares, we need to calculate the number of each color of squares and add them together.

The number of red squares is 14.
The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares, so it's 14 + 4 = 18.
The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares, so it's 18 + 6 = 24.
The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares, so it's 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, we add the number of squares of each color together: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

The total number of squares is 68, and since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Adam has 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
   To find Betty's points, we need to calculate 30% of Adam's points and add it to Adam's points.
   30% of 50 = 0.3 * 50 = 15
   Betty's points = Adam's points + 15 = 50 + 15 = 65
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   Tom's points = Betty's points - 30 = 65 - 30 = 35
4. Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   Marta's points = 3 * Tom's points = 3 * 35 = 105

Now, let's add up the points of all the students:
Adam's points + Betty's points + Tom's points + Marta's points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold:

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that there are 8 males and 6 females, so the total number of people is 8 + 6 = 14.

Each female ate 3 dumplings, and since there are 6 females, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

The total number of males is 8, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

The total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is 18 (by females) + 32 (by males) = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten, which is 50.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we first need to find the percentage used for industrial purposes and then subtract it from the total percentage used by the city.

The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. 

First, find 80% of 40%: 
80% of 40% = 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%

This means 32% of the river's water is used by the city for industrial purposes.

Now, subtract this from the total percentage used by the city to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes:

"To find the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends, we first need to find the total number of slices they ate. Since there are 5 people in total (Bryce and 4 friends), and 2/3 of their pizzas were eaten, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by these 5 people as follows:

5 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 5 * 8 = 40 slices

However, this is the total number of slices eaten by 5 people, but we know that 2 of these people ate 2/3 of their pizzas, and the other 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas as well. So, we need to find the total number of slices eaten by the 2 friends who ate ¾ of their pizzas.

The 2 friends who ate ¾ of their pizzas ate 2 pizzas in total (since there are 5 people in total, and 2 of them ate ¾ of their pizzas). The total number of slices eaten by these 2 friends is:

2 pizzas * ¾ * 12 slices/pizza = 2 * 9 = 18 slices

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by all 5 people:

40 slices (eaten by 5 people) + 18 slices (eaten by 2 friends) = 58 slices

Since there were 5 pizzas in total (5 people), and each pizza had 12 slices, the total number of slices is:

5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices

Now, we can find the number of slices left:

60 slices (total) - 58 slices (eaten) = 2 slices

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe into inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet into inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, we get 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, let's use the information that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We can represent this as an equation:

Length of Topher's shoe = 9 * Length of Bobby's shoe + 10

Substituting the length of Topher's shoe (100 inches) into the equation, we get:

100 = 9 * Length of Bobby's shoe + 10

Now, we can solve for the length of Bobby's shoe by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

90 = 9 * Length of Bobby's shoe

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9 to find the length of Bobby's shoe:

Length of Bobby's shoe = 90 / 9
Length of Bobby's shoe = 10

2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by midday.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
The remaining people after midday are 5000 - 2000 = 3000.
2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people voted by 16:00.

So, the number of people who voted by 16:00 is 2000 (by midday) + 2000 (by 16:00) = 4000.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 5000 - 4000 = 1000.

"To find out how many boxes of graham crackers are needed, we first need to calculate the total number of smores required.

9 kids want 2 smores each, so the total number of smores for kids is 9 * 2 = 18.
6 adults will eat 1 smore each, so the total number of smores for adults is 6 * 1 = 6.
The total number of smores required is 18 (for kids) + 6 (for adults) = 24.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 smores, we need to divide the total number of smores required by 8 to find out how many sleeves are needed.
24 smores / 8 smores per sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the total number of sleeves required by 3 to find out how many boxes are needed.
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

Therefore, they will need 1 box of graham crackers."
"Let's break down the information given:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. 

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading her small stickers.

Now, she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading her large stickers.

Now, she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading her large stickers.

Now, let's add up all the buttons she has: 
- 27 small buttons from trading small stickers
- 20 large buttons from trading large stickers
- 60 small buttons from trading large stickers

Since large buttons are worth three small buttons, we can convert the large buttons to small buttons: 
20 large buttons * 3 = 60 small buttons

Now, let's add up all the small buttons: 
- 27 small buttons from trading small stickers
- 60 small buttons from trading large stickers
- 60 small buttons from converting large buttons

Total small buttons = 27 + 60 + 60 = 147 small buttons

Total buttons = 147 small buttons

On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches.

Now, let's add up the total number of matches: 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7 matches.

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let the number of votes against the new regulation be x. 
Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

The total number of people on the council is 33, which is the sum of the votes in favor and against the new regulation. So, we can write the equation as x + 2x = 33.

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2x, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2: 2 * 11 = 22

The final answer is: 22"

"To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we need to first find the total number of songs in all the playlists. 

Number of songs in one playlist = 300
Number of playlists = 20
Total number of songs = 300 * 20 = 6000

Since each song is 10 hours long, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song to find the total hours.

Total hours = Total number of songs * Length of each song
Total hours = 6000 * 10
Total hours = 60000

The final answer is: 60000"
"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we first need to find the number of people who think horse #2 will win and then the number of people who think horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

The remaining people are 50 - 10 = 40 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win.
60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win, which is 40 - 24 = 16 people.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.
2. One third of the Pomeranians are girls.
3. There are 6 Pomeranian girls.

From point 2, we know that 1/3 of the Pomeranians are girls, and we are given that this number is 6. To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that 2/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and we found that there are 18 Pomeranians. To find the total number of puppies, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total Puppies = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we first need to calculate how much money he has after Ava gives him her allowance. 

Jayden initially had $70. Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. 

So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250.
- The first house needs 1/2 of what the second house needs.
- The third house needs double what the first house needs.

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as x. Then, the first house needs x/2 cases, and the third house needs 2*(x/2) = x cases.

Since the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250, we can set up the equation:

x + (x/2) + x = 250

To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms:

5x = 500

Now, divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

Since the third house needs x cases, and x = 100, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each person's purchase and then add them together.

So, George has 290 fruits in total. 

The final answer is: 290"
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the money she had and then divide the remaining amount by the cost of each candy bar.

Marissa had $80 and spent $20 on the ball, so she had $80 - $20 = $60 left.

The candy bars cost $5 each, so we divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar: $60 / $5 = 12.

Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

12"
"To find out how much money Sam needs to spend, we first need to calculate the total amount of oranges required to make 4 liters of juice. Since Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice, he would need 5 * 4 = 20 kilograms of oranges to make 4 liters of juice.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the oranges. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so 20 kilograms would cost 20 * 3 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how many books Ahmed read, we need to divide the number of books Ezra read by 2, since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. 

Ezra read 300 books, so Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we need to add the 150 books Ezra decided to read to the total number of books they both read. 

Ezra read 300 + 150 = 450 books. 
Ahmed read 150 books. 

So, altogether, they read 450 + 150 = 600 books.

"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then add them together.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for the hours worked is 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. Additionally, she earns $5 per day for teaching more than 3 classes, so she earns $5 for Monday. Therefore, her total earnings for Monday is $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her total earnings for the hours worked is 2 hours * $15/hour = $30. Since she teaches less than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day. Therefore, her total earnings for Wednesday is $30.

Now, let's add her earnings for both days: $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold.

The company sold 5 of each of the 4 vanilla scents, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.

The company sold 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold. 

20 (vanilla scents) - 16 (fruity scents) = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount he gets from selling eggplants is 20 x 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he already has $60 from selling eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling corn.

Bennet has 25 ears of corn, and he needs to make $75 from selling them. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount he needs to make ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25).

$75 ÷ 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total time Tatiana has for the weekend, we add the hours on Saturday and Sunday. 
Total time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours.

Since Tatiana reads for 3 hours, we subtract this from the total time to find the remaining time. 
Remaining time = Total time - Time spent reading = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours.

Tatiana plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time. 
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours.

Now, we subtract the time spent reading and playing video games from the total time to find the time spent playing soccer. 
Time spent playing soccer = Total time - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games = 12 hours - 3 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours.

To find the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time and multiply by 100. 
Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time) * 100 = (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 50%.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps of the problem.

Anthony started with 50 pencils. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. 

1/2 of 50 is 50 * 1/2 = 25. So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon. 

Now, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. 

3/5 of 25 is 25 * 3/5 = 15. So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie.

Now, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils. 

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at 75 mph. So, the time it takes to drive to the museum is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since he drives back, the total driving time is 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours.

Adding the time he spends at the museum (6 hours), the total time Jack is gone from home is:

Total time = Driving time + Time at the museum
Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 10 hours

"To find out how many wheels Henry will need in total, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles separately and then add them together.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each car, and he has 57 cars. So, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is 4 * 57 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle, and he has 73 motorcycles. So, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is 2 * 73 = 146.

Now, we add the total number of wheels needed for the cars and the motorcycles: 228 + 146 = 374.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels in it. To find out how many wheels will be left, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the total number of wheels in the box: 650 - 374 = 276.

So, you have to pay $800."
"To find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to calculate the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so we multiply 600 by 1/3:
600 * (1/3) = 200 movies in series

Since Mike can buy the series for $6, the cost of the series is $6.

Next, let's find the number of remaining movies. We subtract the movies in series from the total number of movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies remaining

40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we multiply 400 by 0.4:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

The cost of the older movies is $5 each, so the total cost of the older movies is:
160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are normal movies. We subtract the number of older movies from the remaining movies:
400 - 160 = 240 normal movies

The cost of the normal movies is $10 each, so the total cost of the normal movies is:
240 * $10 = $2400

Now, we add the cost of the series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies to find the total cost:
$6 + $800 + $2400 = $3206

The final answer is: $3206"

The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To find the distance, we first need to find the speed at which they hiked. They drove at 50 miles per hour, and they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their speed when they drove. 

Half of 50 miles per hour is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. 
5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. To find the distance they hiked, we multiply the speed by the time: 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

They drove for 4.5 hours (6 - 1.5 = 4.5) at 50 miles per hour. To find the distance they drove, we multiply the speed by the time: 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked: 225 + 30 = 255 miles.

The final answer is: 255"
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them gets from enemies, berries, and the timer.

Let's assume Emma's score from enemies is x. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's score from enemies will be x + 8.

Emma collects 3 fewer berries than Ava, so let's assume Ava collects y berries. Emma collects y - 3 berries.

The time difference is 4 seconds, and Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma. So, Emma gets 30 * (60 - (60 - 4)) = 120 points from the timer, and Ava gets 30 * (60 - (60 - 4)) = 120 - 30 * 4 = 120 - 120 = 0 points from the timer.

Now, let's calculate their total scores:

Emma's score = (x) + (y - 3) + 120
Ava's score = (x + 8) + y + 0

To find the difference in their scores, we need to find the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores. 

Ava's score - Emma's score = (x + 8) + y - (x + (y - 3) + 120)
= (x + 8) + y - x - y + 3 - 120
= 8 + 3 - 120
= 11 - 120
= -109

The final answer is: -109"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each, so the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 x 30 = 60 dollars.

Since the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, we can subtract the cost of the two pizzas that we already know to find the cost of the other two pizzas. 

64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars. 

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on usual days and the extra days to get the total number of times they ride in a week. 

15 (usual days) + 12 (extra days) = 27

"Let's break down the information given:

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.

After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. The number of orange fish he bought would then be 2x (since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish).

The total number of fish in the pet store tank was 17, and it's a mix of white and orange fish. Since Bob bought all the fish from the tank, the total number of fish he bought is 17.

The total number of fish in Bob's pond after buying more fish is 7 (initial fish) + 17 (bought fish) = 24.

We know that the number of orange fish in the pond is 3 (initial) + 2x (bought), and the number of white fish is 4 (initial) + x (bought).

Since the total number of fish in the pond is 24, we can set up the equation:

3 + 2x + 4 + x = 24

Combine like terms:

3 + 4 + 2x + x = 24
7 + 3x = 24

Subtract 7 from both sides:

3x = 17

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 17/3
x = 5.67

Since we can't buy a fraction of a fish, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, as you can't buy a fraction of a fish. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of white fish he bought, and the question does not specify that we must round down. 

However, since the question asks for the number of white fish he bought, and we know that the total number of fish he bought is 17, we can find the number of white fish he bought by setting up the equation:

Number of white fish bought + Number of orange fish bought = 17
x + 2x = 17

Combine like terms:

3x = 17

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 17/3
x = 5.67

Since we can't buy a fraction of a fish, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, as you can't buy a fraction of a fish. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of white fish he bought, and the question does not specify that we must round down."
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total miles driven per week and then multiply it by the fuel efficiency and the price of gas.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per week. Since Andy drives to work and back home every day from Monday to Friday, the total miles driven per day is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles. 

The total miles driven per week is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, let's calculate the total gallons of gas consumed per week. We can do this by dividing the total miles driven per week by the fuel efficiency (10 MPG).

Total gallons of gas consumed per week = Total miles driven per week / Fuel efficiency
= 50 miles/week / 10 MPG
= 5 gallons/week

Finally, let's calculate the total money spent on gas per week by multiplying the total gallons of gas consumed per week by the price of gas.

Total money spent on gas per week = Total gallons of gas consumed per week * Price of gas
= 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon
= $15/week

"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the amount she spent from the quarters and the twenties separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent from the quarters. Since she had 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, we can multiply the number of quarters by the value of each quarter:

140 quarters * $0.25 = $35

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent from the twenties. Since she had 10 twenties and spent 3/5 of them, we need to find 3/5 of 10:

3/5 * 10 = 6

Since each twenty is worth $20, we can multiply the number of twenties she spent by the value of each twenty:

6 twenties * $20 = $120

Now, let's add the amount she spent from the quarters and the twenties to find the total amount she paid for lunch:

$35 + $120 = $155

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature at night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night. So, the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house to at least 32 degrees. 

To find out how many degrees Carson needs to heat the house, we subtract the current temperature from the safe temperature: 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we divide the total degrees needed by the degrees each log heats: 20 / 5 = 4.

Price after discount = Original price - Discount
Price after discount = $40 - $10
Price after discount = $30

Now, let's find out how much money Mike will have left over:
Money left over = $50 - $30
Money left over = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total salary for each month, then multiply it by 3.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After 3 months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (hired in the first month) + 20 (hired in the second month) + 20 (hired in the third month) = 260 employees

The total salary for each month is the number of employees multiplied by the salary per employee:
200 employees * $4000 = $800,000 per month

Since the company pays this amount every month for 3 months, the total amount paid is:
$800,000 * 3 = $2,400,000

The final answer is: $2,400,000"
"To find the total time the choir will be caroling, we need to add the time it takes to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and the time it takes to sing ""Jingle Bells"" once.

Time for ""Deck the Halls"" = 150 seconds
Time for ""Jingle Bells"" = 240 seconds

Total time for ""Deck the Halls"" = 150 seconds * 2 = 300 seconds
Total time for ""Jingle Bells"" = 240 seconds

Total caroling time = Total time for ""Deck the Halls"" + Total time for ""Jingle Bells""
Total caroling time = 300 seconds + 240 seconds
Total caroling time = 540 seconds

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial pay rate is $10 per hour. After 2 months, he gets a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new pay rate $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After another year, he gets a raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final pay rate $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, so her starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours:

Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the cost of 3 loaves of bread, we multiply the cost of one loaf by 3. 
3 loaves of bread cost 3 x $2 = $6.

To find the cost of 2 bagels, we multiply the cost of one bagel by 2. 
2 bagels cost 2 x $1 = $2.

Now, we need to find the difference between the cost of 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels. 
The difference is $6 - $2 = $4.

"To find out how many points Nikita scored, we need to calculate half of Pierson's score and then add 11. 

Pierson's score is 278. Half of 278 is 278 / 2 = 139. 

Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, so Nikita scored 139 + 11 = 150.

To find the total points, we need to add Pierson's score and Nikita's score. 

Pierson's score is 278 and Nikita's score is 150. 

278 + 150 = 428.

The final answer is: 428"
"To find the total number of trees planted by the students, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of students per class and then multiply the result by 1 (since each student plants 1 tree).

Total students = 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students
Total trees planted by students = 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

To find the total number of trees planted by the teachers, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of teachers per class and then multiply the result by 2 (since each teacher plants 2 trees).

Total teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers
Total trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Now, we add the total number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to find the total number of trees planted.

Total trees = 1000 trees (by students) + 240 trees (by teachers) = 1240 trees

The final answer is: 1240"
"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 4.2 stuffed goats, but we'll round up to 5 stuffed goats to ensure the percentage is at least 30%.

So, Bubbles should buy 5 stuffed goats.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in 2 weeks and 1 week.

In 2 weeks, there are 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in 2 weeks.

In 1 week, there are 7 days. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in 1 week.

Total hours Kris has played = 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

Since Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement, she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between the two distances.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles

The distance between the two cars will be the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars:
140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

So, the distance between the two cars after 2 hours will be 20 miles.

The final answer is: 20"

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice the fourth-graders', so it's 2 * 40 = 80 out of 400 passed

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460 students passed

Next, let's calculate the total number of students in the school:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000 students

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
(460 students passed / 1000 total students) * 100 = 46%

The final answer is: 46"
"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to find out how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and he has 2 bags of glass chips, we need to find out how many glass chips he has in total. 

Each bag holds 72 chips, so 2 bags will hold 2 x 72 = 144 chips.

Now, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of chips needed to make one square inch of the mosaic. 

144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches.

Since the mosaic is three inches tall, and it's a square mosaic, we need to find the length of the mosaic. 

To do this, we need to find the square root of the total square inches of the mosaic. 

Square root of 12 square inches = √12 ≈ 3.46 inches.

However, since the question asks for the length of the mosaic, we need to consider the width of the mosaic as well. Since the height is 3 inches, and it's a square mosaic, the width will also be 3 inches.

So, the length of the mosaic will be the square root of the total square inches, which is approximately 3.46 inches. However, since the width is 3 inches, the length will be the square root of 12, which is approximately 3.46 inches."
"To find the total amount of tea left, we need to calculate the total amount of tea drank by the students. 

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea drank by all students is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. 

So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party in gallons is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to first determine how many candies he has in total. 

Dale initially ordered 100 candies and then sold 150. So, he had 100 - 150 = -50 candies left. However, this is not possible since you can't have a negative number of candies. This means he must have ordered more candies to sell. 

Dale then ordered 100 more candies. So, the total number of candies he has now is 100 (initial) + 100 (additional) = 200 candies.

Since he sold 150 candies, he still needs to sell 200 - 150 = 50 candies to sell all of his candy. 

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break it down step by step:

- At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students on campus.
- At the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

To find the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, we need to subtract the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May: 
320 - 10 = 310

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25).

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (7 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 x 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 x 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used and the ones dropped from the total number of marshmallows in the bag.

Total marshmallows in the bag = 35
Marshmallows used by John = 9
Marshmallows used by DeSean = 9
Total marshmallows used = 9 + 9 = 18
Marshmallows dropped = 3
Total marshmallows used and dropped = 18 + 3 = 21

Now, let's subtract the total marshmallows used and dropped from the total number of marshmallows in the bag:
Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14

Since there are 14 marshmallows left, and there are 2 kids, we can divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many each kid can have:
Marshmallows per kid = 14 / 2 = 7

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per minute.

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. 
Two of his friends can play for half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter.
One of his friends can play for 1.5 times as long, so they can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter.

They play for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Jack's total time played is 240 minutes. Since he plays for 20 minutes per quarter, he uses 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.
Two of his friends play for 10 minutes per quarter, so they use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each.
The other friend plays for 30 minutes per quarter, so they use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 + 24 + 24 + 8 = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 * 0.25 = $17.

The final answer is: $17"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces.
- The amount of citrus zest is equal to the amount of fragrance.
- The amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x. Then the amount of salt (and sugar) is 2x, and the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total amount of the scrub is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: x (citrus zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces.

Combine like terms: 8x = 10.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 10 / 8 = 1.25.

Since the amount of oil is 4x, the amount of oil is 4 * 1.25 = 5 ounces.

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars. So, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

3. He gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

4. In total, Joe sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars. So, he gave away a total of 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

5. To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the total number of cars he gave away from the initial number of cars he had: 40 - 24 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine how much money the students raised in total. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the students raised $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we know that there are 20 students and they all raised the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the number of students: $125,000 / 20 = $6,250.

"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first find the total number of cars in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break.

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 of the cars had gone. This means 1/2 of 70 had left, so 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars had left.

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot when Hunter got out of class for the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35.

However, the question asks for the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break. Since 1/2 of the cars had gone, the other half remained. So, the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break is also 35.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341. We can write an equation to represent this:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, Smendrick has 3x cards, and Becca has 3x + 12 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

Cindy had 5 green eggs.

She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars.
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week:

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, Saskay can lift 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we need to convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12.

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total distance traveled by Mason, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance covered in the first 4 hours + Distance covered in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total distance = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, one kangaroo would take 18 * 3 = 54 hours to travel across the highway.

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, if one kangaroo takes 54 hours to travel across the highway, four turtles traveling at half the speed would take 54 * 2 = 108 hours to travel across the highway.

The final answer is: 108"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Kora made 20 dishes.
- Rory made 20 more clay dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
- Jada made twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

To find the total number of clay dishes they all made together, we add the number of dishes each person made: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

The final answer is: 140"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The original price of the laptop is $600.
- The price is reduced by $200 when trading in the old laptop, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
- Erika has some savings in her purse, let's call this x.
- She earned $150 from her part-time job.
- Her mom gave her $80.

After receiving the $150 and $80, Erika has a total of $150 + $80 = $230. Since she now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, she must have had some savings to begin with. 

The total amount of money Erika has now is $230 (from her job and her mom) + $50 (the amount she still needs) = $280. This is the total amount she has now, which includes her initial savings.

So, the initial savings in her purse is $280 - $230 = $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find out how many slices Adam has initially, we need to calculate the total number of slices from the large and small apples. 

3 large apples can be sliced into 3 * 5 = 15 slices.
5 small apples can be sliced into 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

So, the total number of slices is 15 + 15 = 30.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to find out how many cows he currently has. 

The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow, and he has 3 cows. So, the total amount of milk he currently produces is 5 * 3 = 15 liters.

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs 25 - 15 = 10 more liters. Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, he needs 10 / 5 = 2 more cows.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the used length of each glue stick and subtract it from the original length.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the used length is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6 of the original length. 
5/6 of 12 millimeters is (5/6) * 12 = 10 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the used length is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 of the original length. 
1/3 of 12 millimeters is (1/3) * 12 = 4 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the used length is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2 of the original length. 
1/2 of 12 millimeters is (1/2) * 12 = 6 millimeters.

Now, let's add the used lengths of all three glue sticks: 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 12 - 20 = -8 millimeters. However, since we can't have a negative length, this means that the total used length is more than the original length, which is not possible. This indicates that the problem has an error or inconsistency."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy and subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the items is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and $200 from his brother, so he has a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

Now, let's subtract the amount of money Gabriel has from the total cost of the items: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

So, Gabriel still needs $5600."

"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount he had.

Craig initially had 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is 2 x $20 = $40.

He bought 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of the squirt guns is 6 x $2 = $12.

He also bought 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 x $3 = $9.

The total amount Craig spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

So, Craig has $19 left.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, but we don't know the number of socks Jack has yet.
3. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, which means Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.
4. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Now, we know Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes. Peter has 30 dishes and an unknown number of socks. Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.

The total number of socks is 30 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Peter's socks) = 90 socks.
The total number of dishes is 60 (Jack's dishes) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 90 dishes.

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90 + 90 = 180."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total students: 20
- Students good at math only: 5
- Students good at English only: 8
- Students good at both math and English: unknown (let's call this x)

We know that the total number of students is the sum of students good at math only, students good at English only, and students good at both math and English. 

So, we can write the equation: 5 + 8 + x = 20

Combine the constants: 13 + x = 20

Subtract 13 from both sides: x = 7

Now, we know that the students good at both math and English are 7. To find the total number of students good at math, we need to add the students good at math only and the students good at both math and English.

Total students good at math = students good at math only + students good at both math and English
= 5 + 7
= 12

"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time available for performances and then divide it by the time each group takes to perform, including getting on and off the stage.

The total time for each group is 2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit the stage = 10 minutes.

The total time available for performances is the total time of the concert minus the intermission time. The concert is 2 hours long, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. The intermission is 10 minutes. So, the total time available for performances is 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we divide the total time available for performances by the time each group takes to perform: 110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the original amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

After 1 year, Brenda will have: $300 (original amount) + $225 (interest) = $525
After 2 years, Brenda will have: $525 (previous amount) + $225 (interest) = $750
After 3 years, Brenda will have: $750 (previous amount) + $225 (interest) = $975

The final answer is: $975"
"To find the number of white shirts with no collars, we need to find the number of white shirts with collars first. Since half of the white shirts have collars, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of white shirts with collars = Total number of white shirts / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20

Now, we can find the number of white shirts with no collars by subtracting the number of white shirts with collars from the total number of white shirts:

Number of white shirts with no collars = Total number of white shirts - Number of white shirts with collars
= 40 - 20
= 20

Next, we need to find the number of floral shirts with no buttons. We know that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons, so we can find the number of floral shirts with no buttons by subtracting the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts:

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars:

Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we need to first determine how many trays the farmer has. 

The farmer has 900 eggs and each tray holds 30 eggs. 

To find the number of trays, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray: 
900 eggs / 30 eggs per tray = 30 trays

Now, we know the farmer has 30 trays and each tray is sold for $2.5. 

To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray: 
30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

"To find the number of rooms that need to be cleaned, we need to calculate one-half of 90 rooms. 

One-half of 90 rooms is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we need to multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes per room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

"Let's break down the information given:

1. I am three years younger than my brother, so if my age is x, my brother's age is x + 3.
2. I am 2 years older than my sister, so my sister's age is x - 2.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so my mom's age is 3(x + 3) - 1.
4. When you add all our ages, you get 87, so the equation is: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 
x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87
Combine like terms: 
6x + 9 = 87

Subtract 9 from both sides: 
6x = 78

Divide both sides by 6: 
x = 13

So, I am 13 years old."
"To find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required and then divide that by the number of glue sticks in each pack.

Total number of students: 27
Number of glue sticks per student: 2
Total number of glue sticks required: 27 * 2 = 54

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by 8 to find out how many packs are needed.

54 ÷ 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are asked to assume he will have some extra glue sticks left over, so we can round down to the nearest whole number.

6.75 ≈ 6.75 → 7 (rounding up would be 7, but since we are assuming he will have some extra glue sticks left over, we can round down to 6)

However, if we round down to 6, we will not have enough glue sticks for all the students. So, we will round up to 7 packs.

7 packs of glue sticks will give us 7 * 8 = 56 glue sticks. This is more than the 54 glue sticks needed, so Mr. Jackson will have some extra glue sticks left over.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to calculate the amount of water on the first day, the second day, and the third day, then add them together.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Now, let's add the amount of water on each day: 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

"To find the total number of people infected after three days, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the previous total.

Day 1: 
- Initially, there are 10 people infected.
- Each infected person infects 6 others, so 10 * 6 = 60 new infections.
- Total infected after Day 1: 10 (initial) + 60 (new) = 70.

Day 2: 
- The 60 people infected on Day 1 infect 60 * 6 = 360 others.
- The 10 people from the initial infection are still infected, so we add the 360 new infections to the 10 from the previous day.
- Total infected after Day 2: 70 (previous day) + 360 (new) = 430.

Day 3: 
- The 410 people infected on Day 2 (430 - 20, because 10 of the original 10 were already infected) infect 410 * 6 = 2460 others.
- The 10 people from the initial infection are still infected, so we add the 2460 new infections to the 430 from the previous day.
- Total infected after Day 3: 430 (previous day) + 2460 (new) = 2890.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each girl is:
- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold. 

She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, she baked 2 * 5 = 10 loaves. 

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she baked 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so the total amount she raised is 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars.

The final answer is: $40"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. If Gretchen has 70 gold coins, we can represent the number of silver coins as x. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can write an equation: x + 30 = 70. 

To find the number of silver coins, we need to solve for x. Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation: x = 70 - 30. 

x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we need to add the number of gold coins and silver coins: 70 (gold) + 40 (silver) = 110.

"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We know that S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
We also know that A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to get S = (F - 12) + 25
S = F + 13

We also know that the total number of books is 85, so S + A + F = 85
Substituting the first two equations into this one, we get (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85
Combine like terms to get 2F + 1 = 85
Subtract 1 from both sides to get 2F = 84
Divide both sides by 2 to get F = 42

Then, he lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he lost, we need to calculate 1/4 of 80, which is 80 * 1/4 = 20 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles he lost from the total marbles he had after receiving the gift: 80 - 20 = 60 marbles.

So, Paul has 60 marbles left.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she gets from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
Amy correctly answers 80% of 10 questions, so she answers 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correctly.
Each question is worth 1 point, so she gets 8 * 1 = 8 points from multiple-choice questions.

For true/false questions: 
Amy correctly answers 90% of 20 questions, so she answers 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correctly.
Each question is worth 1 point, so she gets 18 * 1 = 18 points from true/false questions.

For long-answer questions: 
Amy correctly answers 60% of 5 questions, so she answers 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correctly.
Each question is worth 5 points, so she gets 3 * 5 = 15 points from long-answer questions.

Now, let's add the points from each type of question to find Amy's total score:
8 (multiple-choice) + 18 (true/false) + 15 (long-answer) = 41 points.

The final answer is: 41"
"To find out how much money Isaias made from selling the chickens, we first need to find out how many chickens he sold. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens, we can calculate this as:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since he sold 180 chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he made is:

180 * 50 = $9000

However, the question asks for the cost of the chickens he took to the market for sale, not the selling price. To find the cost, we need to subtract the profit from the selling price:

$9000 (selling price) - $2000 (profit) = $7000

So, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 2, since they sold an equal number. 

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people who sold an equal number of glasses = 2 (Micah and Mitchell)
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16

Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we need to find the difference between the number of glasses Julie sold and the number of glasses Micah sold.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 16
Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah = 14 - 16 = -2

The final answer is: $\boxed{-2}$"
"To find out how much Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure first.

Let's start with the cost of the manicure. Since Iris spent 1/4 as much on the manicure as she did on her hair, and she spent $400 on her hair, the cost of the manicure is 1/4 * $400 = $100.

Now, let's find the cost of the pedicure. Since Iris spent 3/4 as much on the pedicure as she did on her manicure, and the manicure cost $100, the cost of the pedicure is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, we can add up the costs of the hair, manicure, and pedicure to find the total amount Iris spent at the spa: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The final answer is: $575"
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to first calculate how much money she will make from selling the rope. 

The rope is 20 meters long, and her friend wants to buy it for $2 a meter. So, the total amount she will make is 20 * $2 = $40.

Now, she plans to use this money to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 a meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we divide the total amount she made by the cost per meter of the new rope: $40 / $1.5 = 26.67 meters.

Since she can't buy a fraction of a meter, we'll round down to 26 meters. 

The cost of the new rope will be 26 * $1.5 = $39.

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the total amount she made: $40 - $39 = $1.

So, Sarah will have $1 left over after buying the new rope.

The final answer is: $1"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years. This means that her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years old.

Let's assume that the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age is 'x'. 

In 'x' years, Melanie's age will be her current age plus 'x', which is 8 + x. 

Her age in 'x' years will also be thrice her current age, which is 3 * 8 = 24.

So, we can set up the equation: 8 + x = 24.

To solve for 'x', we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: x = 24 - 8.

x = 16.

Therefore, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age in 16 years.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken. Since each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and the 5 packs of bacon cost $10, the cost of one pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2. Therefore, the cost of one pack of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4. Since Kelly has 6 packs of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

Next, let's find the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Now, let's find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Since Kelly has 7 packs of apples, the total cost of the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

The total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart is $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65, so the amount of money she has left in her budget is $65 - $60 = $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let the runtime of Elaina's usual concert be x minutes. 

The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so its runtime is 2x minutes. 

At the end of the concert, she also performs a 15-minute encore. 

The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, which is the sum of the runtime of the concert and the encore. 

So, we can write the equation: 2x + 15 = 65.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. 

Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 50 / 2
x = 25

The runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he had initially.

Argo initially had 200 toys. He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. 

First, let's add up the number of toys he gave away: 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys.

Now, let's subtract the number of toys he gave away from the initial number of toys: 200 - 150 = 50.

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday and Wednesday, and then multiply the number made on Friday by 2.

Number of chimichangas made on Tuesday and Wednesday: 125 + 125 = 250
Number of chimichangas made on Friday: 125 * 2 = 250
Total number of chimichangas made on those three days: 250 + 250 = 500

The final answer is: 500"
"To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs. 

Let's assume the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is x. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the total number of microphones arranged in pairs is 2x.

However, we know that 20% of the total 50 microphones won't fit, which means 80% of the microphones will be arranged in pairs. 

We can set up the equation: 80% of 50 = 2x

To find 80% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.8: 
50 * 0.8 = 40

Now we have the equation: 40 = 2x

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
x = 40 / 2
x = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

20"
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, Jerry counts 6 birds in the bushes.

Then, 2/3 of 6 is 4, so 2/3rd of the number of birds flying overhead is 4. This means there are 4 birds flying overhead.

Next, Jerry sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we multiply 3 by 8, which is 24.

Now, we add the number of birds in the bushes, flying overhead, and feeding: 6 + 4 + 24 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to subtract the cookies Lani ate from the total number of cookies and then divide the result by the number of jars.

Total cookies = 55
Cookies eaten = 5

"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids."
"To find the number of flowering plants, we first need to find the number of indoor and outdoor plants.

One-fourth of the plants are indoor plants. 
Number of indoor plants = 100 * (1/4) = 25

The remaining plants are outdoor and flowering plants. 
Total remaining plants = 100 - 25 = 75

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. 
Number of outdoor plants = 75 * (2/3) = 50

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants. 
Number of flowering plants = 75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.
Percentage of flowering plants = (25/100) * 100 = 25%

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up an equation to find the speed of the thingamabob.

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x. Then, the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11x. We know that the speed of the whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second, so we can set up the equation:

11x = 121

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 11:

x = 121 / 11
x = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob is 11 meters per second, we can find the speed of the whirligig. The whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob, so we can multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55

"Let's break down the information given. Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad. 

Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, the price of the yogurt is $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Since Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods, the cost of two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

To find the cost of one carrot, we divide the cost of two carrots by 2: $2 / 2 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Tasha made $80 in total from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.
2. She made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn.
3. The number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is three times the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn.
4. The number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is five times the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn.

Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. Then, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is 3x, and the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is 5x.

Since we know she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and she made the same amount for each lawn, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x + 6(3x) + 6(5x) = 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x.

We know that the total amount she made from mowing lawns and selling lemonade is $80. So, we can set up the equation: 54x + lemonade sales = 80.

We also know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, so we can substitute 6 for 6x in the equation: 54x + lemonade sales = 80. Since 6x = 6, x = 1.

Now we can substitute x = 1 into the equation 54x + lemonade sales = 80 to find the amount she made from lemonade sales: 54(1) + lemonade sales = 80. 54 + lemonade sales = 80. 

Subtract 54 from both sides: lemonade sales = 26.

"To find Harry's weight, we need to find Christian's weight first, then subtract 5 kg from it.

Martin's weight is 55 kg. 
Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"To find John's total earnings, we need to calculate the total hours he rents his car out in a month and multiply it by his hourly rate. 

He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so the total hours he rents his car out in a month is 10 * 3 = 30 hours.

His hourly rate is $25, so his total earnings are 30 * $25 = $750.

To find his profit, we need to subtract his car payment from his total earnings. 

Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Martha initially had some notebooks, but we don't know the exact number. Let's call the number of notebooks Martha initially had 'x'. 

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3x notebooks.

Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so now she has x + 5 notebooks.

We are also given that after buying 5 more notebooks, Martha had a total of 7 notebooks. This means that x + 5 = 7.

To find the value of x, we need to solve the equation x + 5 = 7. 

x + 5 = 7
x = 7 - 5
x = 2

So, Martha initially had 2 notebooks. 

Now, we know that Joseph had 3x = 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

The question asks how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. To find this, we need to subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has: 7 - 6 = 1.

"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we first need to determine how many cookies are left after Susan's husband took some. 

Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies, so we subtract 4 from 100: 100 - 4 = 96 cookies left.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. 

To divide 96 cookies by 6, we do the following calculation: 96 ÷ 6 = 16.

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies."
"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today.

So, Denise read a total of 10 + 18 = 28 pages, and Daniel read a total of 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the number of pages Daniel read from the number of pages Denise read: 28 - 13 = 15.

"To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we first need to determine how many bowls of soup are left after dinner. 

Since Calvin, his wife, and their two children are eating dinner, that's a total of 3 adults and 2 children, which equals 5 people. 

Each adult can eat one bowl, so the adults will eat 3 bowls. Each child can also eat one bowl, so the children will eat 2 bowls. 

In total, 3 + 2 = 5 bowls will be eaten for dinner. 

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child's bowls. Since 5 bowls were eaten for dinner, we need to find out how many bowls the pot can fill in terms of child's bowls. 

Since 4 adult bowls equal 8 child's bowls, we can say that 1 adult bowl equals 2 child's bowls. 

So, 5 bowls (eaten for dinner) in terms of child's bowls is 5 * 2 = 10 child's bowls. 

Since the pot can fill 8 child's bowls, and 10 child's bowls were eaten for dinner, there are 8 child's bowls left. 

To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to divide the remaining child's bowls by the number of children. 

8 child's bowls / 2 children = 4 times.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. 

Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write the equation: 
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2x

We know that Duncan's current age is 60, so we can find his age eight years ago by subtracting 8 from 60:
Duncan's age eight years ago = 60 - 8 = 52

Now we can equate the two expressions for Duncan's age eight years ago:
52 = 2x

To find Adam's age four years ago, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:
x = 52 / 2
x = 26

Now that we know Adam's age four years ago, we can find his current age by adding 4 to x:
Adam's current age = x + 4
Adam's current age = 26 + 4
Adam's current age = 30

Finally, we can find Adam's age in 8 years by adding 8 to his current age:
Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku and then divide it by the time it takes to drink one bottle of water.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so an extreme sudoku takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to convert the time from minutes to half hours. 180 minutes is equal to 180 / 30 = 6 half hours.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, he drinks 6 bottles of water in 6 half hours.

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. 1 dozen balloons is equal to 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, 12 balloons will cost 12 * $0.5 = $6.

The total cost of the cake and the balloons is $11 + $6 = $17.

They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total cost of the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount of money they spent is $17 + $14 = $31.

Since they spent $31 in total, and they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount by 2 to find out how much each of them received. 

$31 / 2 = $15.50

The final answer is: $15.50"
"To find out how many pieces of fruit Kira bought in total, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges. 

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit, we need to subtract 2 from the total number of fruits Kira bought.

14 - 2 = 12

So, there are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer, and then add them together.

There are 6 students playing tennis. Since there are twice that number playing volleyball, there are 6 * 2 = 12 students playing volleyball.

The total number of students playing soccer is 16 boys + 22 girls = 38 students.

Now, let's add the number of students playing each sport: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total profit, we need to first find the total revenue and the total cost.

The total number of lollipops sold is 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops.

The total revenue is the price per lollipop * total number of lollipops sold = $0.8 * 300 = $240.

The total cost is the price per lollipop * total number of lollipops bought = $0.5 * 300 = $150.

The total profit is the total revenue - total cost = $240 - $150 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them together.

Larry has 3 cats.

He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of each type of pet together: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The final answer is: 47"
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices both Abby and Josh can eat per day. 

Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day. 

Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day.

To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat per day. 

24 slices / 6 slices per day = 4 days.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and we want to know the total by her 10th birthday, we need to count the months from her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday.

From 5 to 10 years old is 5 years. There are 12 months in a year, so 5 years is 5 x 12 = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell every month, she will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we first need to determine how many cups of tea are in each row. 

Lana has 27 cups of tea in total and divides them into 3 rows. So, the number of cups in each row is 27 / 3 = 9 cups.

Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row is also 9 / 2 = 4.5. However, since you can't have half a cup of tea, this means that the number of mint tea cups in each row must be 4 or 5. 

However, if there were 4 mint tea cups in each row, then there would be 5 chamomile tea cups in each row, and the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 4 = 12. This leaves 27 - 12 - 15 = 0 cups for cinnamon tea, which is not possible.

If there were 5 mint tea cups in each row, then there would be 4 chamomile tea cups in each row, and the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 5 = 15. This leaves 27 - 15 - 15 = -3 cups for cinnamon tea, which is also not possible.

However, if we consider the fact that the number of mint tea cups in each row must be a whole number, we can try 4.5 as the number of mint tea cups in each row. This is not possible, but we can try 4.5 * 2 = 9 as the total number of mint tea cups in each row. This leaves 27 - 9 - 15 = 3 cups for cinnamon tea, which is possible.

However, we are looking for the number of mint tea cups in each row, not the total number of mint tea cups. If there are 9 mint tea cups in total, then there must be 9 / 3 = 3 mint tea cups in each row.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to first determine how many trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes the sloth 4 hours to make a round trip, he can make 8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips in 8 hours.

Since he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and he makes 2 trips, he needs to collect 24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the amount of water in the tank, we need to first calculate half of the water in the pool. 

Half of 10000 gallons is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Since they use water from the tank to water their garden, we don't need to consider the garden in this problem.

The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. To find the remaining water after 6 days, we need to subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount.

Total water used in 6 days = 500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons.

Remaining water in the tank = Initial water in the tank - Total water used
= 5000 gallons - 3000 gallons
= 2000 gallons

The final answer is: 2000"

Colby's monthly budget is $150. He has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Money left: $150 - $130 = $20

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 and he has $20 left, he can see 2 more movies on Fridays or Saturdays.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to first find the calories of a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we can find the total calories of the pastries. There are 200 mini cinnamon rolls with 200 calories each, so the total calories from the cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories. 

There are 300 mini blueberry muffins with 150 calories each, so the total calories from the blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories of the pastries are 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: 85000"
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to find the total number of Junebugs removed and divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
= 378 / 5

"To find out how far each vehicle traveled, we need to multiply their speeds by the time they traveled.

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so it traveled 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so it traveled 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of toys she has now.

The total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls is the sum of the blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings: 31 + 8 + 9 = 48.

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of toys Sophie has now: 62 - 48 = 14.

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14. 

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and John's age as J. 

We are given that Pp = J + 10. 
We are also given that P = Pp + J. 
We are also given that P + Pp + J = 100.

Substituting Pp = J + 10 into the equation P = Pp + J, we get P = (J + 10) + J. 
Simplifying this, we get P = 2J + 10.

Substituting P = 2J + 10 and Pp = J + 10 into the equation P + Pp + J = 100, we get (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100.
Simplifying this, we get 4J + 20 = 100.

Subtracting 20 from both sides, we get 4J = 80.

Dividing both sides by 4, we get J = 20.

Now that we know J = 20, we can find Pp = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.

Finally, we can find P = Pp + J = 30 + 20 = 50.

"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had a total of 1 (Maria's balloon) + 4 * 2 (friends' balloons) = 1 + 8 = 9 balloons.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons: 9 + 15 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many tables they need, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so they have 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. 
They already have 10 boxes, so in total, they have 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

They can fit 2 boxes per table, and they already have 15 tables. To find out how many more tables they need, we need to divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes per table and subtract the number of tables they already have.

60 boxes / 2 boxes per table = 30 tables needed
30 tables needed - 15 tables already owned = 15 tables needed

So, they need 15 new tables.

"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then divide it by the number of seeds they spat.

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both of them is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

They spat a total of 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

The average total distance spat is 820 / 75 = 10.93 (rounded to two decimal places).

"To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then multiply that by the price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine:

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Now, let's find the difference in revenue:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

So, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay with the two options and then find the difference.

Option 1: 24-hour stay - 1600 pesos
Option 2: 12-hour stay (1000 pesos) + additional hours

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is 17 hours later. Since the first 12 hours are already included in the 1000 pesos, we need to calculate the cost of the additional 5 hours.

5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay with the additional hours is 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's find the difference between the two options:
Difference = 1600 pesos (24-hour stay) - 1350 pesos (12-hour stay with additional hours)
Difference = 250 pesos

Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing the option of adding 70 pesos for every additional hour after the 12-hour mark.

The final answer is: $250"
"To find out how much hay Nate needs, we first need to determine how much each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. 
3 pounds less than 10 pounds is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now that we know each sheep needs 7 pounds, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, so the total amount of hay needed for the sheep is 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds, so the total amount of hay needed for the goats is 15 * 5 = 75 pounds.

Finally, we can find the total amount of hay Nate needs by adding the amount needed for the goats and the amount needed for the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

"To find out how much money John has left after buying gas and depositing money in the bank, we first need to calculate his total earnings. 

John's total earnings = 50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars.

Now, let's subtract the cost of gas and the money he wants to deposit in the bank from his total earnings. 

Money left after gas and deposit = 300 dollars - 50 dollars - 100 dollars = 150 dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pencils. 

Cost of pencils = 5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars.

Now, let's subtract the cost of pencils from the money left after gas and deposit. 

Money left after pencils = 150 dollars - 50 dollars = 100 dollars.

Finally, let's calculate how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money. 

Number of pens = 100 dollars / 25 dollars = 4.

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we need to calculate the original price and then subtract the discount. 

Original price of 10 CDs = 10 * $15 = $150
Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60
Price after discount = $150 - $60 = $90

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each, so he made a total of 5 * $40 = $200 from selling them.

To find out how much money James was out, we need to subtract the money he made from the price after discount. 

Money James was out = Price after discount - Money made from selling CDs
= $90 - $200
= -$110

However, since we can't have a negative amount of money, this means James actually lost $110."

"To find the time it took James to swim 60% of the distance, we first need to find 60% of 20 miles. 

60% of 20 miles = 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time it took him to swim 12 miles is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. James swims the remaining distance at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

The total time it took James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time it took to swim the remaining distance:

Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D. 

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. 

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can set these two equations equal to each other: A + 20 = D + 10.

We can simplify this equation by subtracting 10 from both sides: A + 10 = D.

Now we know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. We also know that the total points scored by the team is 45, so A + B + D = 45.

We can substitute B = A + 20 and B = D + 10 into the equation A + B + D = 45. This gives us A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3A + 30 = 45.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 3A = 15.

Divide both sides by 3: A = 5.

"To find out how many reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked. He worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. 

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the total number of minutes he worked is:
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know that Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many reports he staples per minute, we divide 30 by 15:
30 reports / 15 minutes = 2 reports/minute

Now, we multiply the total number of minutes he worked by the number of reports he staples per minute:
900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports

"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she usually sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total sleep time, we need to calculate the time from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. This is 7 hours and 55 minutes, which is 7 * 60 + 55 = 455 minutes.

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

Two dozen cups = 2 * 12 = 24 cups
Measuring spoons = 2/3 * 24 = 16 spoons

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with:
16 - 6 = 10 spoons

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the measuring spoons and the measuring cups:

"To find the number of occupied beds initially, we need to calculate 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital. 

1/5 of 1000 is 100. 

So, the hospital has 100 occupied beds initially. 

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, in 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted will be 50 * 14 = 700.

The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks will be 100 (initially occupied) + 700 (admitted in 2 weeks) = 800.

The total capacity of the hospital is 1000, so the number of unoccupied beds will be 1000 - 800 = 200.

"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to first find out how many emails are not work-related. 

Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. So, 6 emails are to family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after subtracting the work and family emails. 9 (non-work emails) - 6 (family emails) = 3.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.
2. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya.
3. Aliya is 3 years old.

Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old, we can find Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3:
Shawna's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years

Now that we know Shawna's age, we can find her father's age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5:
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9 = 45 years

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from the number she reported.

Let's assume the number Courtney reported is 100%. 
20% of 100 is 20. 

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 100 - 20 = 80% of the number Courtney reported.

Since Courtney reported 48 people, 80% of 48 is 0.8 * 48 = 38.4.

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

However, since we can't have a fraction of a person, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. 

The final answer is: 38"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Since Jason carried 2 balls, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey must have carried half of what Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan must have carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

The total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is the same as the total number of balls carried by the three boys, which is 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day, we need to add the holes dug each day and subtract the two holes filled in. 

Holes dug on the first day = 10
Holes dug on the second day = 13
Holes dug on the third day = 8
Holes filled in on the third day = 2

Total holes by the end of the third day = 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. 
Holes at the end of the first day = 10
Holes at the end of the fourth day = 4 * 10 = 40

Since the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 40, and we know that 29 holes were dug by the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is 40 - 29 = 11."
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 15 more than each of them. 

Since the third person got 15 more than Amora and Lainey, the third person got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

We also know that the total number of corn chips is the sum of the amount each person got. 

Let's denote the total number of corn chips as 'x'. We can set up the equation: 

x = 70 + 70 + 85

Combine the constants on the right side of the equation: 
x = 225

So, the total number of corn chips is 225."
"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, let's find 50% of the cost of supplies. 
50% of $400 = 0.5 * $400 = $200

Now, we add this to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel.
Cost of travel = Cost of supplies + 50% of cost of supplies
Cost of travel = $400 + $200
Cost of travel = $600

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L. 

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so A + S + L = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so L = S + 5.

We also know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so S = 4A - 13.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one: A + (S + 5) + S = 339.

This simplifies to A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Now we can substitute the third equation into this one: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.

This simplifies to A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.

Combine like terms: 9A - 21 = 339.

Add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Divide by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

The final answer is: 147"
"Let's break down the information given. Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

If there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, then the number of episodes is 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Then, let's calculate the distance traveled in the northerly direction:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled in the final southerly direction:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

The total distance traveled in the southerly direction is the sum of the first and third distances:
Total southerly distance = 300 miles + 110 miles
Total southerly distance = 410 miles

The distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is the total southerly distance minus the distance traveled in the northerly direction:
Distance between homes = Total southerly distance - Northerly distance
Distance between homes = 410 miles - 36 miles
Distance between homes = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"
"To find out how many brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she had initially and then subtract the number of brownies eaten.

Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies. 
She took home 1/2 a dozen brownies from the office, which is 6 brownies. 
Her friends had 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies. 
So, the total number of brownies Greta had initially is 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

To find out how many brownies Greta had left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies: 66 - 18 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we need to multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form).

Nani's sister's age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of all three family members: Nani (8 years), his brother (16 years), and his sister (6 years).

The total age of all three family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time it takes for each type of string and then add them together.

For synthetic gut: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
For polyester string: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
For hybrid sets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Now, let's add the time for each type of string together: 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first 2 phones and the remaining 2 phones. 

The first 2 phones cost $600 each, so the total cost for the first 2 phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining 2 phones are half price, so each costs $600 / 2 = $300. The total cost for the remaining 2 phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

The total cost for all 4 phones is $1200 + $600 = $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we first need to find the number of players in Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can add 7 to 13 to find the number of players in Zeke's team.

13 (Carlton's players) + 7 = 20 (Zeke's players)

Now, we can add the number of players in both teams to find the total number of players.

13 (Carlton's players) + 20 (Zeke's players) = 33

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the garden first. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2 to get the total number of slats needed.

Total slats = Perimeter * 2
Total slats = 50 * 2
Total slats = 100

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we first need to determine how many boxes she had left after giving some to her mom and sister. 

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, so she gave away a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. 

Now, she has 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left. 

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges in 8 boxes is 8 * 20 = 160 oranges.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges. 

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total number of states in both countries together, we first need to find the number of states in the USA and India.

The USA has 50 states.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we need to find half of 50 first. 
Half of 50 is 50 / 2 = 25.

Now, we add 4 to 25 to find the number of states in India.
25 + 4 = 29

Now, we add the number of states in the USA and India together.
50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, he still needs to earn $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can find the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the amount he still needs to earn ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 / $5 = 5 hours.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Robert has 30 cherries.
- Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard.
- The total number of cherries is 60.

Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, we can represent Richard's cherries as 30 - 10 = 20.

Now, let's find out how many cherries Jerry has. We know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries together. 

So, Jerry has 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.

Now, let's find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. Robert has 30 cherries, and Jerry has 10 cherries. 

The difference is 30 - 10 = 20.

"Let's break down the information given:

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. 
On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. 
On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. 
So, on Saturday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:

On Saturday:
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes * $6 = $60
- Apple pie: 11 boxes * $15 = $165
Total earnings on Saturday: $60 + $165 = $225

On Sunday:
- Gingerbread: 15 boxes * $6 = $90
- Apple pie: 15 boxes * $15 = $225
Total earnings on Sunday: $90 + $225 = $315

Total earnings for two days: $225 + $315 = $540

"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use.

Pamela will be outside for 4 hours a day for 8 days, so the total hours she will be outside is 4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours.

Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour, she will use 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.

Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she will need, we divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces):

32 ounces / 8 ounces per bottle = 4 bottles

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

First, let's find 40% of the price of the blue car:
40% of $100 = 0.4 x $100 = $40

Now, subtract $40 from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car:
$100 - $40 = $60

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad and twice as old as his brother. 

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's current age as D, and his brother's current age as B. 

We know that E = 19. 

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = 0.5D. 

We can solve for D by multiplying both sides by 2: 2 * 24 = D, D = 48.

When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B. 

We can solve for B by dividing both sides by 2: 24 / 2 = B, B = 12.

Now that we have the ages of Emil's dad and brother, we can find the sum of their ages. 

The sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to first convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches
111 feet = 111 * 12 = 1332 inches

Now, we need to find the total space taken up by the plants and the space between them. 

Let's assume the number of plants is 'n'. The total space taken up by the plants is 12n inches. The total space between the plants is 1.5 * (n - 1) feet, which is equal to 18 * (n - 1) inches.

The total length of the flower bed is the sum of the space taken up by the plants and the space between them. 

1332 = 12n + 18(n - 1)

Simplifying the equation:
1332 = 12n + 18n - 18
1332 = 30n - 18
1332 + 18 = 30n
1350 = 30n
n = 1350 / 30
n = 45

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of flowers she needs to buy is 45 - 17 = 28.

"To find out how much Jessica sets aside each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income. 

25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 x $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, we need to find out how many months are in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

Now, let's calculate how much she saves in a year: $500.00 x 12 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so we need to divide the total amount she saves in a year by the cost of one pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can buy: $6,000.00 ÷ $1,000.00 = 6.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp. 

First, let's find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we can divide 90 by 6 to get the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. 

90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Now, let's find out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide 90 by 30 to find out how many sets of 30 shrimp she needs to cook, and then multiply that by 10 minutes. 

90 / 30 = 3 sets of 30 shrimp
3 sets * 10 minutes = 30 minutes

However, since peeling and cooking are done simultaneously, we need to add the time it takes to peel and cook. 

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes

So, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature. 

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, and the room warmed up by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total warming effect in 2 hours is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is the sum of the cooling effects minus the warming effect: 6 + 12 - 4 = 14 degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
2. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, Bill saw the comet when he was 3 * 30 = 90 years old.

Now, we need to find out how long ago Bill's dad saw the comet. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can divide the time it takes for the comet to orbit the sun by the age of Bill when he saw the comet the second time to find the time between the two sightings.

Time between sightings = 90 years (Bill's age when he saw the comet the second time) / 3 (the factor by which Bill's age was multiplied) = 30 years.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, and the time between the two sightings is 30 years, it means that Bill's dad saw the comet 30 years before the comet's orbit period (75 years). 

So, the time between the two sightings is 75 - 30 = 45 years.

Now, we need to find out how old Bill was when his dad saw the comet. Since the time between the two sightings is 45 years, and Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, we can find Bill's age at that time by subtracting 45 from Bill's age when he saw the comet the second time.

Bill's age when his dad saw the comet = 90 - 45 = 45 years.

Therefore, Bill was 45 years old when his dad saw the comet.

"To find the number of flights to France, we first need to find the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 flights.

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is (3/4) * 88 = 66. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/2) * (88 - 66) = (1/2) * 22 = 11.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

In total, Adam received $6 from his mother and $12 from his father, which is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam bought the trousers for $30. To find out how much he had to contribute from his savings, we need to subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers.

So, Adam had to contribute $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. We know that the total age of the children is 20, and Akbar and Alessandro are 3 and 4 years old, respectively. 

The total age of Akbar and Alessandro is 3 + 4 = 7. 

Since the total age of the children is 20, the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 20 - 7 = 13.

We are also given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's denote the average age of the group as A. Then, Helene's age is 2A.

The total age of the group is the sum of the ages of all children, which is A + A + 2A + W = 20. 

Combine like terms: 4A + W = 20.

We also know that the average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 20/4 = 5. 

So, A = 5.

Now we can substitute A = 5 into the equation 4A + W = 20:

4(5) + W = 20
20 + W = 20

Subtract 20 from both sides:
W = 0

However, this is not possible since the age of a child cannot be 0. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, which is 5. So, Helene's age is 2 * 5 = 10.

The combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 13, and Helene is 10 years old. So, Wilfred's age is 13 - 10 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 

Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend gives him $200, but this is not included in the amount that the lawyer will donate based on. 

The lawyer will donate three times the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, which is 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to first find out the total number of cookies. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

Since the bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church, the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 * 1/2 = 750.

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got. 

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Number of cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's assume the total number of slices of the watermelon is 6x, where x is a constant. 

Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid, let's say each kid gets 1 slice and each adult gets 2 slices. 

The total number of slices given to the kids is 4 * 1 = 4 slices. 
The total number of slices given to the adults is 2 * 2 = 4 slices.

The total number of slices given out is 4 + 4 = 8 slices. 

Since the total number of slices is 6x, we can set up the equation 6x = 8. 

Solving for x, we get x = 8 / 6 = 4/3.

Now, the total number of slices given to each adult is 2 slices. 

The percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (2 / (6x)) * 100 = (2 / (6 * 4/3)) * 100 = (2 / 8) * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments.

Time spent on rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 180 minutes to hours: 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Converting 300 minutes to hours: 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours

Since Doctor Jones works 9 hours at the clinic, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total work hours: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

First, let's add the time to make the cake batter (20 minutes) and bake the cake (30 minutes): 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.

Next, we add the time to cool the cake (2 hours, which is 120 minutes) and the time to frost the cake (10 minutes): 120 + 10 = 130 minutes. 

Now, we add the time to make the cake batter and bake the cake (50 minutes) to the time to cool and frost the cake (130 minutes): 50 + 130 = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

Now, we add the 3 hours to the time she wants to serve the cake (5:00 pm) to find the latest time she can start making the cake: 5:00 pm + 3 hours = 8:00 pm.

The final answer is 8."
"Let's break down the information given. Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes, and together they sold 64 chocolate bars. 

First, let's add the number of boxes they sold: 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars in total and they sold 8 boxes, we can find the number of chocolate bars in a box by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes: 64 / 8 = 8.

The number of chocolate bars in a box is 8."
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, so it is rented 3 x 4 = 12 days in a month (assuming a 4-week month).

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 x 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40.

The total cost per session is $40. Since the studio is rented 12 days a month, the total number of sessions is 12.

The total earnings per month would be the total cost per session multiplied by the number of sessions: $40 x 12 = $480.

The total cost of renting the studio per month is $25 x 12 = $300.

The total earnings of the dance studio in a month would be the total earnings from students minus the total cost of renting the studio: $480 - $300 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as 'x'. Since Peter has 4 boxes, the total number of chocolate bars he has is 4x. We are given that this total is 64, so we can write the equation:

4x = 64

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 64 / 4
x = 16

So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as 'y'. Since Martha has 7 boxes, the total number of chocolate bars she has is 7y. We are given that this total is 56, so we can write the equation:

7y = 56

To find the value of 'y', we can divide both sides of the equation by 7:

y = 56 / 7
y = 8

So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

To find the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box between Peter and Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in Martha's box from the number of chocolate bars in Peter's box:

16 - 8 = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5. 

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of babies born in a month is 30 * 4 = 120.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the initial population plus the number of babies born in a year. 

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed them to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need, we need to do that next.

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon.

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

The final answer is: $826"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to find the number of blue and yellow sticks first. 

We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"

"To find the number of female students, we need to first find the number of students over 16 and under 16, and then find the number of female students in each group.

Half of the students are over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students over 16 years old.
One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male: 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16 years old.
The number of female students over 16 years old is 1500 - 375 = 1125.

The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students under 16 years old.
One-half of the students under 16 are male: 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16 years old.
The number of female students under 16 years old is 1500 - 750 = 750.

Now, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16 years old to find the total number of female students: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To find out how much water is remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons. 

The remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the initial charge of the power bank be x%.

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining will be x - 5 * 9 = x - 45%.

In the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining will be (x - 45) - 3 * 7 = x - 45 - 21 = x - 66%.

We are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

x - 66 = 28

To solve for x, we add 66 to both sides of the equation:

x = 28 + 66
x = 94

The charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%.

The final answer is: 94"
"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and her hourly tips are $15. So, her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Now, Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car for the down payment. 20% of $10,000 is 0.2 * $10,000 = $2000.

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save the down payment, we divide the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000). 

$2000 / $1000 = 2

So, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate how much money he has left after purchasing the other fruits. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he has already purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Now, let's calculate how many plums he can buy with the remaining money:
Plums cost $0.25 each, so the number of plums he can buy is $0.75 / $0.25 = 3.

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. 

Anne kept 2 packs, so she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Since she gave the packs equally to 10 friends, each friend received 13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are in 1.3 packs. Since each pack has 60 pieces, 1 pack has 60 pieces. 

1.3 packs = 1 pack + 0.3 packs. 
1 pack has 60 pieces, so 0.3 packs will have 0.3 * 60 = 18 pieces.

So, each friend received 60 + 18 = 78 pieces of sweets.

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."

"To find the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, there were 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the remaining guests are 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests who have not checked out yet is 76 + 15 = 91.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30.

So, the total number of guests who have checked in is 30 (in the afternoon) + 7 (after dinner) = 37.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say the number of large stuffed animals sold is L and the number of small stuffed animals sold is S. We know that S = 2L (since she sold twice as many small ones as large ones).

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one, and the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. So, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total amount earned from the sales is $120. We can set up the equation:

(Large stuffed animal price * Number of large stuffed animals) + (Small stuffed animal price * Number of small stuffed animals) = Total amount earned
($12 * L) + ($4 * S) = $120

Since S = 2L, we can substitute S with 2L in the equation:
($12 * L) + ($4 * 2L) = $120

Combine like terms:
($12 * L) + ($8 * L) = $120
($20 * L) = $120

Now, divide both sides by $20:
L = $120 / $20
L = 6

Since S = 2L, we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold:
S = 2 * 6
S = 12

"To find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe, we need to first find out how much he can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. So, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, we know that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. To find out how much 40 dwarves can mine in a day, we multiply 36 by 40: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds.

Since there are 30 days in a month, we multiply 1440 by 30 to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The ratio for the first package is 3/2, and for the second package is 6/4. We can simplify these ratios to 3/2 and 3/2, which means the price increases by a factor of 1.5 for each additional sandwich. 

Since the first package has 2 sandwiches and the second package has 4 sandwiches, the price of the second package is 1.5 times the price of the first package. 

Given that the second package costs $6, we can calculate the price of the first package as 6 / 1.5 = $4. 

Now, we can find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches by multiplying the price of the first package by 4 (since 8 is 4 times 2). 

The price of the package with 8 sandwiches is 4 * 4 = $16."

"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 x 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so she released 6 yellow balloons, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 x 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). 

However, the last scenario is dependent on the first two not happening. So, we need to find the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not convincing her, which is 60% (100% - 40%) * 80% (100% - 20%). 

Now, we can find the total probability of the first two scenarios happening: 50% + 40% = 90%. 

The probability of the last scenario is 60% * 20% = 12%. 

Now, we add the probabilities of the first two scenarios and the last scenario: 90% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since probabilities cannot exceed 100%. This means we have to subtract the total probability from 100% to get the correct answer.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we need to first calculate the total number of available seats for guests. 

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300
Total seats taken: 950 + 300 = 1250
Available seats for guests: 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Now, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive. 

Number of graduates: 950
Available seats for guests: 4750
Tickets per graduate: 4750 / 950 = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up.
2. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. So, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is 2 * 75 = 150.
3. Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, the number of small beans he can eat is equal to the number of medium-sized beans multiplied by 3. 

Now, let's calculate the number of small beans he can eat: 
150 (medium-sized beans) * 3 (small beans per medium-sized bean) = 450 small beans.

The final answer is: 450"
"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses.

Total earnings: Melissa is paid $15 per day for 3 days, so her total earnings are 15 * 3 = $45.

Total expenses: Melissa has to pay $3 for parking each day for 3 days, so her total expenses are 3 * 3 = $9.

Now, let's calculate her net earnings: Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses = 45 - 9 = $36.

Since Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, her total hours worked is 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

To find out her hourly wage after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total hours worked: Hourly wage = Net earnings / Total hours worked = 36 / 18 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of the books is 3 * 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of the pencils is 3 * 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the books and the pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

So, Ted spent a total of 66 dollars.

The final answer is: 66"
"To find the total number of seconds it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to find out how many soda bottles he can place along the driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next.

First, let's find out how many bottles Richard can place along the driveway. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to put a bottle every 3 feet. 

Number of bottles = Total length of driveway / Distance between each bottle
Number of bottles = 24 / 3
Number of bottles = 8

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to go to 7 more bottles (8 total bottles - 1 for starting point). 

Time taken to go from one bottle to the next = 5 seconds
Total time taken = Number of bottles - 1 (since he starts at the first bottle) * Time taken to go from one bottle to the next
Total time taken = 7 * 5
Total time taken = 35 seconds

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how many packs Uncle Franky can make, we first need to find out how many apples he has in total. Since he ordered two boxes and each box has 40 apples, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box.

Total apples = 2 boxes * 40 apples/box = 80 apples

Now, we need to find out how many packs he can make with 80 apples. Since each pack has 8 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack.

Number of packs = Total apples / apples per pack = 80 / 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract it from the initial amount of money she had.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 x $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 x $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor starts with $50, so after buying the cheese, she will have $50 - $40 = $10 left.

The final answer is: $10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and not working while in college. 

The total amount of loans he took is 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000.

The amount of money he lost by not working while in college is 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000.

So, the total amount of money he needs to earn is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After college, his income triples, so he now earns $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

To find out how long it will take him to earn $300,000 at this new income, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to find the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, so the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of one piece of fabric is length * width, so it's 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, he needs 2 * 80 = 160 square feet of fabric.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102. 
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 
5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209. 
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add up the number of letters delivered each day: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The final answer is: 736"
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.
The cost of the pasta salad is 6 people * $6 per person = $36.

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad together: $65 + $36 = $101.

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101."
"To find the average amount Johnny's dad lost, we need to calculate the total amount lost and divide it by the number of races.

On the first race, he lost $5.
On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost, so he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.
On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race, so he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

The total amount lost is $5 + $16.50 = $21.50.
The number of races is 3.

The average amount lost is $21.50 / 3 = $7.17.

The final answer is: $7.17"

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to first calculate their current heights.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet, which is equal to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole's initial height was 50 inches and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's denote the share of the first person as x.

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

The share of the first person is $420."
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

First, let's convert 3 weeks to days: 3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to find the fraction of a day in hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 of a day is (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

Combine like terms:

(2x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2(2x + 4) + x = 38

Expand the equation:

4x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4
= 10

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

Initial price of the car = $20,000
Depreciation rate = 21% per year

In 2008:
Price in 2008 = Initial price - (Initial price * depreciation rate)
= $20,000 - ($20,000 * 0.21)
= $20,000 - $4,200
= $15,800

In 2009:
Price in 2009 = Price in 2008 - (Price in 2008 * depreciation rate)
= $15,800 - ($15,800 * 0.21)
= $15,800 - $3,328
= $12,472

In 2010:
Price in 2010 = Price in 2009 - (Price in 2009 * depreciation rate)
= $12,472 - ($12,472 * 0.21)
= $12,472 - $2,620.32
= $9,851.68

The price of the car in 2010 is $9,851.68."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to find the total number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

10% of the books are written in German, so that's 10% of 50, which is 0.1 x 50 = 5 books in German.

Now, we add the number of English and German books to find the total number of non-Spanish books: 25 + 5 = 30.

Since there are 50 books in total, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

Total distance = 1955 kilometers
Distance driven by Bernice = 325 kilometers

Distance left to drive = Total distance - Distance driven by Bernice
= 1955 - 325

"To find out how many gallons Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we first need to find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. 
So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups.

Now, we need to convert the cups to gallons. 
There are 16 cups in a gallon. 
So, the number of gallons Ingrid drinks in 30 days is 240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Initially, Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
120 + 20 = 140

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100) board the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
140 - 50 + 100 = 190

At the third station, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
190 - 80 = 110

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"To find the total amount Alison spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55

The final answer is: $55"
"To find the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, we need to find the area of one tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of one tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Now, we need to find the total number of tiles required to cover the kitchen floor. Since the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt and each tile covers 1 SqFt, we need 200 tiles.

The cost of each tile is $12. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of tiles by the cost of each tile: 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the increased cost of the insurance, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72
Increased cost = $120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we need to multiply it by 12 to find the yearly cost.

Yearly cost = $192 * 12 = $2304

The final answer is: $2304"
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since each twin bed has 1 set of sheets and the king size bed has 1 set of sheets, the total number of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 + 1 = 5 sets of sheets.

Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 1, which is 2. This means he can wash 2 twin sets of sheets and 1 king set of sheets at a time.

However, since he has 5 sets of sheets to wash, he will need to do 3 loads of laundry: 2 loads of 2 twin sets and 1 king set, and 1 load of 1 twin set.

Now, to find out how many loads of laundry he does in a year, we need to multiply the number of loads he does in a week by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year.

So, the total number of loads of laundry he does in a year is 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas, so the total number of slices is 8 * 4 = 32 slices.
- Becky ate 10 slices.
- Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.
- Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, let's add up the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia: 
10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31 slices.

The final answer is: 31"
"Let's denote the time Donovan took as 'x'. Since Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, the time Betsy took is 'x + 18'. 

The total time they took to make the meal is the sum of their individual times, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation as x + (x + 18) = 98.

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98.

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Since x is Donovan's time, and Betsy took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's time is x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

The cost of the cast is $200.

"To find out how many emails James responds to, we first need to find out how many emails he doesn't respond to. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 x 80 = 16 emails. 

So, James doesn't respond to 16 emails. 

The rest of the emails he responds to is 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Since James works for 5 days a week, we need to multiply the number of emails he responds to in a day by 5. 

64 emails/day * 5 days/week = 320 emails/week.

The final answer is: 320"

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"To find out how many pizzas are left, we first need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 is 0.7 x 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. 
They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 x 40 = 32 pizzas.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

He also wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, which is 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert 24500 cents to dollars by dividing by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

2. Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in the 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.
3. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so there are 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches left.
4. Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so now there are 3 + 3 = 6 sub sandwiches left.
5. The total number of meatballs in the remaining 6 sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

"To find the total cost of the butter, we need to first calculate the total pounds of butter Dennis needs to buy. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen, he needs 6 pounds of butter.

Since the grocery store has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half off, we can calculate the cost as follows:

- For the first pound of butter, the cost is $4.00.
- For the second pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00 (since it's half off).

For the remaining 4 pounds of butter, the cost will be the same as the first pound, which is $4.00 per pound.

So, the total cost of the butter is:
$4.00 (first pound) + $2.00 (second pound) + $4.00 (third pound) + $4.00 (fourth pound) + $4.00 (fifth pound) + $4.00 (sixth pound) = $22.00

"To find the total number of guests, we need to add the number of classmates, dance class members, and family members, then subtract the number of people who said they could not come.

Total guests = 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family members) - 4 (could not come) = 41

Since the initial fee is for 20 guests, we need to find the number of additional guests.
Additional guests = Total guests - 20 = 41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is $6 each, so we multiply the number of additional guests by the cost per guest.
Cost for additional guests = 21 * 6 = $126

Now, we add the initial fee and the cost for the additional guests to find the total cost.
Total cost = Initial fee + Cost for additional guests = $125 + $126 = $251

"To find out how much Jenny paid for the roses, we need to determine if she bought the roses by the dozen or individually. Since she bought 15 roses, it's more cost-effective for her to buy a dozen (12 roses) and 3 individual roses.

The cost of a dozen roses is $15. 
The cost of 3 individual roses is 3 * $2 = $6.
The total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she paid with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

"To find out how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time he needs to wait for the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, we need to find out how long Paul has been waiting at the station. Since the first train arrives at 10 minutes, we need to calculate the time from 10 minutes to 145 minutes.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and then the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is 75% of $2000, which is 0.75 * 2000 = $1500.

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is 1.2 * 1500 = $1800.

To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price he paid, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100.

The difference between the original price and the price he paid is $2000 - $1800 = $200.

The percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend is ($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%.

"To find the total number of jellyfish created, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of jellyfish each spring creates per second. 

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in 4 hours. 

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, we multiply the total seconds by the number of springs:

14400 seconds * 1 jellyfish/second * 5 springs = 72000 jellyfish

However, we need to consider that each spring creates a jellyfish every second, so we should multiply the total number of jellyfish by the number of seconds in a second, which is 1.

72000 jellyfish * 1 = 72000 jellyfish

"To find the total distance James walked, we need to calculate the round trip distance. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back home, the total distance is 2 * 4 miles = 8 miles.

Since James walks 4 miles per hour, we can find the total time it took him to walk the 8 miles by dividing the total distance by his speed. 

Time = Total Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

However, this is the total time for the round trip. We need to find the time it took him to reach the store initially. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back, the time it took him to reach the store initially is half of the total time.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

If Jenny bought the bananas individually, the cost would be: 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Since Jenny bought the bananas in bunches, the cost would be: 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:

- Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the earnings from all types of bikes:

$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we first need to find out how many minutes he spends in class per day and then multiply it by 5.

Since John has 6 periods in a day and each class is 40 minutes long, he spends 6 * 40 = 240 minutes in class per day.

For 5 days a week, he spends 240 * 5 = 1200 minutes in class.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. Since he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these two days, we first need to find his total weekly minutes.

There are 7 days in a week, and he spends 240 minutes in class per day, so his total weekly minutes in class is 240 * 7 = 1680 minutes.

1/16 of his weekly minutes is 1680 / 16 = 105 minutes.

So, he spends 105 minutes on Saturday and Sunday.

Now, we add the minutes he spends in class and the minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday to get his total weekly minutes: 1200 + 105 = 1305 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 1305 / 60 = 21.75 hours.

The height of the ball after the second bounce is 2/3 of the height after the first bounce:
(2/3) * 16 = 10.67 feet

The final answer is: 10.67"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches. 

The first child is 6 feet tall, which is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10).

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"To find the original weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the 270 kilograms left after the Allosaurus ate.

First, the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which was half of what the velociraptors had. So, the velociraptors had 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms.

Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex, the T-Rex must have eaten half of the original weight of the triceratops. The velociraptors had 540 kilograms, which is half of what the T-Rex ate. So, the T-Rex ate 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the original weight of the triceratops was 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint to find out how many gallons are needed. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet. 
The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet. 
The total area of all the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost of painting the room is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so 3 were shaken and 9 were unshaken. Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 1 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 7 sodas in total, with 1 shaken and 6 unshaken. The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans.

Probability = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of cans)
Probability = 1 / 7

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Probability = (1 / 7) * 100
Probability = 14.29%

The final answer is: 14.29"
"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

To find the total distance between the two trains, we add the distances traveled by each train: 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of days Billy helps, we first need to find the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

Now, we subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy helps. 
50 - 10 = 40

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so we need to find the total number of hours he works in a day. 
3 hours/day

Now, we multiply the number of days he works by the number of hours he works per day to find the total number of hours he works. 
40 days * 3 hours/day = 120 hours

Finally, we multiply the total number of hours he works by the number of people he can help per hour to find the total number of people he helps. 
120 hours * 2 people/hour = 240 people

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people who were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people who were present.

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses:
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the number of people transported from the total number of people present. However, the question does not provide the total number of people present. 

But, we can assume that the total number of people present is the sum of the people transported by the buses and the cars and the people inside the church. 

Let's denote the number of people inside the church as x. Then, the total number of people present is x + 480.

However, the question does not provide the total number of people present. We can only assume that the number of people inside the church is the difference between the total number of people present and the number of people transported.

Since we cannot find the total number of people present, we cannot find the number of people inside the church.

However, if we assume that the total number of people present is the sum of the people transported by the buses and the cars and the people inside the church, then the number of people inside the church is the difference between the total number of people present and the number of people transported.

But, the question does not provide the total number of people present."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so Martha's age is 24 - 4 = 20 years old.

"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 
The total time spent on breaks is 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes.
The total time spent on lunch and breaks per day is 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. 
After 5 days, the total time spent is 1 hour * 5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total miles run by all three is 52. We can subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Total miles = 52
Amber's miles = 8
Micah's miles = 28
Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after returning the $15.00 item and then add that to the initial charge.

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. Return: -$15.00 (since she returned an item)
   New balance: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

3. Frying pan: 20% off $20.00
   Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
   Price of frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

4. Towels: 10% off $30.00
   Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
   Price of towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

5. Total cost of new purchases: $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

6. New balance on credit card: $70.00 (previous balance) + $43.00 (new purchases) = $113.00

"Let's break down the information given:

- A fifth of the jellyfish are large.
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
- The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue.
- When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. 
A third of the large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, so x/15 = 6. 

To find the total number of jellyfish, we need to solve for x:
x/15 = 6
x = 6 * 15
x = 90

The final answer is: 90"

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for her retirement. 

First, let's calculate Lauren's current annual savings. Since she saves 20% of her $100,000 salary, her annual savings will be:

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000

Next, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save for her retirement. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current salary in retirement, her annual retirement expenses will be:

40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000

Since she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, the total amount she needs to save is:

$40,000 * 20 years = $800,000

Now, we need to calculate how many years she needs to work to save this amount. We already know her annual savings is $20,000. 

To find the number of years, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her annual savings:

$800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for her retirement. Since she already has a retirement period of 20 years, we need to subtract this from the total number of years:

40 years - 20 years = 20 years

So, Lauren needs to work for 20 more years to save for her retirement."
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to first divide the total length of the ribbon by 4 to get the length of each of the initial cuts. 

100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

Then, we need to divide the length of each initial cut by 5 to get the length of each final cut.

25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

"To find the total population of the school, we need to use the information that 40% of the population is 240 boys. 

Let's set up an equation: 40% of the total population = 240 boys. 

Converting the percentage to a decimal, we get 0.4 * total population = 240.

To find the total population, we divide both sides by 0.4: total population = 240 / 0.4 = 600.

Now that we know the total population is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population: number of girls = total population - number of boys = 600 - 240 = 360.

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how much money your mom spent, we need to add the cost of the pots and the garden soil, then subtract the coupon discount.

The cost of the pots is $19.
The cost of the garden soil is $26.
The total cost before the discount is $19 + $26 = $45.
The coupon discount is $7.

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost: $45 - $7 = $38.

So, your mom spent $38 at the gardening shop.

There are 6 women in total.

The average height of heels is 18 / 6 = 3 inches."
"To find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

To find out how many days it will take her to hike 9,300 miles, we divide the total miles by the miles per day: 9,300 / 250 = 37.2 days.

Since Soledad only has 30 days in June, she will not be able to complete her journey on time. To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we need to calculate the total miles she can hike in 30 days at 250 miles per day: 250 * 30 = 7,500 miles.

The difference between the total miles she wants to hike and the miles she can hike in 30 days is 9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 miles.

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the difference by the number of days: 1,800 / 30 = 60 miles per day.

"To find the total distance John drives in a round trip, we need to calculate the distance of a one-way trip and then multiply it by 2.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles (one way)

Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Total Distance = 140 miles * 2
Total Distance = 280 miles

"To find the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers, we need to calculate the production rate of each group and then add them together.

The first 2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, so together they produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys an hour.
The other 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour, so together they produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys an hour.
The total production rate of the first 4 workers is 12 + 8 = 20 toys an hour.

Since they work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, and the total order is 400 toys. This means that the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys in 10 hours.

To find the production rate of the fifth worker, we divide the total number of toys produced by the number of hours worked: 180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour.

"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we first need to find the weight of each of his dogs. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/4 to find the weight of Elijah's first dog: 60 * 1/4 = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/2 to find the weight of Elijah's second dog: 60 * 1/2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's two dogs to find the total weight of his dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs: 60 + 45 = 105 pounds.

2. Since Kris had 16 stickers, and he got them from Luis, Luis had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he got from Seth, so he had 16 stickers left, which means he used 16 / 2 = 8 stickers from Seth.
4. Since Luis used 8 stickers from Seth, Seth had 8 stickers before giving them to Luis.
5. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so he had 8 stickers before giving them to Luis, which means he had 8 * 2 = 16 stickers in the beginning.

"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to multiply the number of large bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that by the number of M&M's per ounce. 

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Since John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, we can find the total number of small bags by dividing the total number of M&M's by 10.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's call this number A. 
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. 
   Let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted S. Then, Camden painted S + 12 eggs.
   Since they painted a total of 30 eggs, we can write the equation: S + (S + 12) = 30
   Simplifying the equation, we get: 2S + 12 = 30
   Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get: 2S = 18
   Dividing both sides by 2, we get: S = 9
   So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.
3. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, the total number of eggs they painted is 30 + A + A = 56 (since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs).
   Simplifying the equation, we get: 2A + 30 = 56
   Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: 2A = 26
   Dividing both sides by 2, we get: A = 13
   So, Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.
4. To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we subtract the number of eggs Arnold painted from the number of eggs Camden painted: 21 - 13 = 8

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and Nik has 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces and Nik has 200 crayons, he will need 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

The total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 200 (crayons) + 200 (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, the total weight in pounds is 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to calculate 80% of 80 feet. 

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet long, we need to divide the total length by the length of each log to find out how many logs he can make.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks, so we multiply the number of logs by 5 to find out how many planks he can make.

16 * 5 = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank to find out how much he makes.

80 * 1.2 = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Valerie earns $5000 per month.
2. Valerie's brother earns 2 times what Valerie earns, so he earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.
3. Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.
4. Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.
5. To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the speed of Grandma on the beach as x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

The time spent on the beach is 40 minutes, and the distance covered on the beach is 2 miles. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed to find the speed on the beach.

Time on the beach = 2 miles / x miles/minute = 40 minutes
x = 2 miles / 40 minutes
x = 1/20 miles/minute

Now, we know the speed on the beach is 1/20 miles/minute. Since the speed on the sidewalk is twice the speed on the beach, the speed on the sidewalk is 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles/minute.

The time spent on the sidewalk is 1 mile / (1/10 miles/minute) = 10 minutes.

The total time spent on the entire walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk.
Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60. This is 60 - 32 = $28.

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the amount she needs to save ($28) by the amount she saves per week ($4) to find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount. 

28 / 4 = 7

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60. 

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree. 

3 trees had 7 blue birds each, so that's 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.
2 trees had 4 blue birds each, so that's 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.
1 tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add them together: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles and has 60 marbles, we need to find out how many marbles he had initially. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24.

So, if Bob receives 24 more marbles and has 60 marbles, we can set up an equation to find the initial number of marbles he had:

Initial marbles + 24 = 60

To find the initial number of marbles, we need to subtract 24 from 60:

Initial marbles = 60 - 24
Initial marbles = 36

Now, we know that Bob initially had 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from 36:

36 - 10 = 26

So, Bob will have 26 marbles.

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle. 

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the two temperatures multiplied by the total ounces. 

The total ounces after pouring is 5 ounces. 

The average temperature is (33 + x) / 2. 

The total temperature is 5 * ((33 + x) / 2). 

Since Donny can now drink the water, the total temperature must be at least 40 degrees. 

5 * ((33 + x) / 2) >= 40 

Multiplying both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 

5 * (33 + x) >= 80 

Expanding the equation: 

165 + 5x >= 80 

Subtracting 165 from both sides: 

5x >= -85 

Dividing both sides by 5: 

x >= -17 

Since temperature cannot be negative, the minimum temperature of the second bottle must be at least 40 degrees."
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

The number of cows added in three weeks is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.

The initial number of cows is 50, and 420 cows are added. So, the total number of cows after three weeks is 50 + 420 = 470 cows.

Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

The number of chickens added in three weeks is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

The initial number of chickens is 20, and 210 chickens are added. So, the total number of chickens after three weeks is 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is the sum of the total number of cows and chickens, which is 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the total cost of the bagels, we need to first calculate the original price of 4 packs of bagels. 

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs will cost 4 x $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $40.00 and subtract it from the original price.

10% of $40.00 is 0.1 x $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, and Russell ordered 4 packs, the total number of bagels is 4 x 9 = 36.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate, we first need to determine how many scoops 1 less than 3 scoops is. 

1 less than 3 scoops is 3 - 1 = 2 scoops.

Now, we know it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

3 less than 6 potatoes is 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes.

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

To find out how many scoops Gomer ate, we need to know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. 

5 less than 23 scoops is 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, we know it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to divide the number of scoops by 2 and then multiply by 3.

18 scoops / 2 = 9
9 * 3 = 27

"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens: 240 eggs / 12 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to find the total number of red jellybeans. We know there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans. 

So, the number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34.

We know the total number of jellybeans is 60. We already know the number of green and red jellybeans, so we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the number of green and red jellybeans from the total.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
= 60 - (17 + 34)
= 60 - 51
= 9

"To find out how many lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the total number of lemons he collects in a year and then multiply it by 10 (since a decade has 10 years).

First, let's find out how many lemons Tim collects in a year. He has 5 trees and each tree gives him 6 lemons per year. 

5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

Now, we multiply the number of lemons he collects in a year by 10 to find out how many lemons he gets in a decade.

30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

Given that the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can let the number of men be 5x and the number of women be 9x. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation: 5x + 9x = 84

Combine like terms: 14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14: x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of women on the bus initially: 9x = 9 * 6 = 54

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is: 54 - 20 = 34

"Let's break down the information given:

- The cost of a sunflower is $2.
- The cost of a bouquet is $8, which contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earns $26 from sunflowers per day.
- Faraday earns $56 from bouquets per day.

First, let's find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold per day. Since he earns $26 from sunflowers per day, and each sunflower costs $2, we can divide the earnings by the cost of a sunflower to find the number of sunflowers sold per day:

$26 (daily earnings from sunflowers) / $2 (cost of a sunflower) = 13 sunflowers per day

Next, let's find out how many bouquets Faraday sold per day. Since he earns $56 from bouquets per day, and each bouquet costs $8, we can divide the earnings by the cost of a bouquet to find the number of bouquets sold per day:

$56 (daily earnings from bouquets) / $8 (cost of a bouquet) = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:

7 bouquets per day * 12 sunflowers per bouquet = 84 sunflowers per day

Now, let's find the total number of sunflowers sold per day by adding the sunflowers sold individually and the sunflowers in the bouquets:

13 sunflowers per day (sold individually) + 84 sunflowers per day (in bouquets) = 97 sunflowers per day

To find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days, we multiply the number of sunflowers sold per day by 3:

97 sunflowers per day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers

"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to first calculate how many rocks he buys, how much he sells, and then the difference between his initial investment and the money he has left after selling 60% of his inventory.

Adam has $100 to invest. He buys rocks for $5 each. 

Number of rocks he buys = Total money / Price per rock
= $100 / $5
= 20 rocks

He sells 60% of his inventory, which is 60% of 20 rocks.
Number of rocks sold = 20 * 0.6
= 12 rocks

He sells each rock for $7. 
Total money made from selling rocks = Number of rocks sold * Price per rock
= 12 * $7
= $84

Adam initially had $100. After selling 12 rocks, he has $84 left. 
However, he still has 8 rocks left unsold. Since he bought 20 rocks, he still has 8 rocks worth of investment left. 
Value of unsold rocks = Number of unsold rocks * Price per rock
= 8 * $5
= $40

Total money Adam has left = Money made from selling rocks + Value of unsold rocks
= $84 + $40
= $124

However, Adam initially had $100. Since he has $124 now, he has made a profit of $24. But the question asks for the amount of money he loses. Since he made a profit, the amount he loses is $0.

The final answer is $0."

"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). 
So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. 
So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, let's add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend: 
20 (weekdays) + 10 (weekend) = 30.

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week."
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to find the length of the second song first. 

The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (which is the decimal form of 60%).

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we have the lengths of both songs: 5 minutes for the first song and 8 minutes for the second song. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of one person. 

Since each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, Hortex would need 100% / 20% = 5 bottles.

Now, to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, Hortex would need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the current production from the required production: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Since Carla has 8 babies and 3/4 of them wear purple, the number of babies wearing purple is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

Now, 1/4 of the babies wear blue, so the number of babies wearing blue is 1/4 * 8 = 2.

The number of babies wearing blue and bows is 2. 

The number of babies wearing purple and bows is 1/3 of the purple wearers, which is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

Now, the total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of the number of babies wearing blue and bows and the number of babies wearing purple and bows, which is 2 + 2 = 4.

The percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is the number of babies wearing purple and bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, multiplied by 100.

"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he earned from selling the land.

First, let's find out how much land he sold in the first two transactions. 

He sold half of the land for $50, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. 
Then, he sold 1/4 of the remaining land for $30. Since he had 80 - 40 = 40 square meters left, 1/4 of that is 40 / 4 = 10 square meters. 

So, in total, he sold 40 + 10 = 50 square meters in the first two transactions.

The remaining land is 80 - 50 = 30 square meters.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter, so the total amount he earned from the remaining land is 30 * 3 = $90.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he earned from the first two transactions. 
He sold 40 square meters for $50, and 10 square meters for $30. 
The total amount he earned from the first two transactions is $50 + $30 = $80.

"To find the total number of apartments in the first two complexes, we multiply the number of apartments in each by 2: 200 * 2 = 400. 

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400. To find 60% of 400, we multiply 400 by 0.6: 400 * 0.6 = 240. Then we add 240 to 400: 400 + 240 = 640. 

So, the total number of apartments in all three complexes is 400 + 640 = 1040.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects from 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment, so we multiply the number of apartments he collects from per week by his pay per collection: 3120 * 0.40 = 1248.

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

- In the 5th year, the tree produces 50 fruits.
- In the 6th year, the tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- In the 7th year, the tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- In the 8th year, the tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits, the 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
- In the 9th year, the tree doesn't produce any fruit.
- In the 10th year, the tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. 

We are given that R = 4B and B = Y - 7. 

We also know that R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting R = 4B into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Substituting B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37, we get 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides to get 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6 to get Y = 12.

Now that we know Y, we can find B by substituting Y = 12 into the equation B = Y - 7, which gives B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B, we can find R by substituting B = 5 into the equation R = 4B, which gives R = 4 * 5 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Ronnie was given x dollars. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3x dollars.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Ronnie is left with x - y dollars and Rissa is left with 3x - y dollars, where y is the amount they each gave to their little sister.

We are told that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money, so we can set up the equation:

3x - y = (4/5)(3x)

To solve for y, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

15x - 5y = 12x

Now, let's isolate y by subtracting 12x from both sides:

15x - 12x - 5y = 12x - 12x
3x - 5y = 0

Now, let's add 5y to both sides:

3x = 5y

Now, let's divide both sides by 5:

(3/5)x = y

Now, let's substitute this expression for y into the equation for Ronnie's remaining money:

x - y = x - (3/5)x
x - (3/5)x = x - (3/5)x
(2/5)x = x - (3/5)x

Now, let's add (3/5)x to both sides:

(2/5)x + (3/5)x = x
(5/5)x = x

Now, let's multiply both sides by 5:

5x = 5x

Now, let's divide both sides by 5:

x = x

We still have x as the variable. To find the value of x, we need to use the information that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money. We can set up the equation:

3x - (3/5)x = (4/5)(3x)

Now, let's simplify the left side:

(12/5)x = (4/5)(3x)

"Let's break down the information given:

- There are four colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow.
- There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
- Half the mural is yellow.
- The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is the combination of red, white, and purple paint. Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as x. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the total amount of these three colors is 3x.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow. So, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

The other half of the mural is the combination of red, white, and purple paint, which is 3x. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, we can set up the equation:

3x + 6 = 12

Subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 6

Divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x = 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas together: 960 (bedrooms) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 3160 square feet.

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box for $1, we first need to find out how many pods are in the new box. 

The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. 20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. So the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with the new box for $12. Since the new box costs $12 and you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 120 cycles with the new box for $12.

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the total number of cycles by 12.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since he withdraws 1000 dollars in 20 dollar bills, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which means he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he has 20 bills left, and each bill is worth $20, he has 20 * 20 = $400. Tripling this amount gives him 3 * 400 = $1200.

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has $1200, he needs 1200 / 5 = 240 5 dollar bills.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then divide it by the amount of chalk used each day.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of it. 

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

So, after Monday, 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk is left.

The teacher now uses 20% of the chalk each day. 

To find out how many days the chalk will last, we need to divide the remaining chalk by the amount used each day.

2.75 inches / 0.20 = 13.75 days

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Colin's current age as C and Wendy's current age as W.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

3. He put all but 1 of the new apples in his pocket, so he has 1 apple left outside and 7 apples in his pocket. 
4. He threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 6 new apples and 7 apples in his pocket. 
5. He picked up all the remaining apples, so he has 6 new apples and 7 apples in his pocket, making a total of 13 apples.

Cost per bag = $18
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
= 17 * $18
= $306

The final answer is: $306"
"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza her friends will eat. 

For cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is 6 * 6 = 36. 

For pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 4 * 6 = 24.

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find out how many whole pizzas are needed for each type. 

For cheese pizza, 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas. 

For pepperoni pizza, 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, she needs a total of 3 + 3 = 6 pizzas. 

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total miles Sam ran, we need to add the miles he ran on each day. 

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So, the total miles he ran on these days is 3 * 3 = 9 miles.

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So, the total miles he ran on these days is 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. So, his rate of building snowballs is 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. This means that Jay loses 2/15 snowballs per minute.

To find the net rate of snowballs, we subtract the rate at which they melt from the rate at which he builds them:

Net rate = (1/3) - (2/15)
To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 15. So, we convert 1/3 to 5/15:
Net rate = (5/15) - (2/15) = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take Jay to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 1/5 snowballs per minute. We can do this by dividing the total number of snowballs by the net rate:

Time = Total snowballs / Net rate
Time = 60 / (1/5)
Time = 60 * 5
Time = 300 minutes

However, this is the time it would take if Jay didn't lose any snowballs. Since he loses 2 snowballs every 15 minutes, we need to account for this. 

Let's calculate how many 15-minute intervals it will take Jay to build 60 snowballs:

60 / (20/3) = 9 intervals of 15 minutes each

In each 15-minute interval, Jay loses 2 snowballs. So, in 9 intervals, he loses 9 * 2 = 18 snowballs.

To find the actual number of snowballs Jay will have after 9 intervals, we subtract the number of snowballs he lost from the total number of snowballs he built:

Actual snowballs = 60 - 18 = 42

Since Jay has 42 snowballs after 9 intervals, we need to find out how many more snowballs he needs to build to reach 60. 

60 - 42 = 18

Since Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, we can find out how many minutes it will take him to build 18 more snowballs:

18 / 20 = 0.9 hours

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 0.9 hours to minutes:

0.9 * 60 = 54 minutes

So, it will take Jay 54 minutes to build the remaining 18 snowballs.

Now, we add the time it took Jay to build 42 snowballs (9 intervals of 15 minutes each) to the time it will take him to build the remaining 18 snowballs:

9 * 15 = 135 minutes
135 + 54 = 189 minutes

Therefore, it will take Jay 189 minutes to have 60 snowballs."
"To find Jim's age, we need to first find out how old John was 20 years ago. Since John is 28 now, 20 years ago he was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, Jim's age 20 years ago was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

To find Jim's current age, we add 20 years to his age 20 years ago: 4 + 20 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Doxa ate 1 slice. 
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. 
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices eaten, we need to add the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother. 
Total slices eaten = Doxa's slices + sister's slices + brother's slices 
Total slices eaten = 1 + 2 + 3 
Total slices eaten = 6

"Let's break down the information given:

- On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
- On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages (since 50 / 2 = 25).
- At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x. 

After the first day, they had x - 38 + 50 bandages (since they ordered 1 pack of 50).
After the second day, they had (x - 38 + 50) - 28 bandages.
After the third day, they had ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) + 100 (since they ordered 2 packs of 50) - 25 bandages.

We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages. So, we can set up the equation:

((x - 38 + 50) - 28) + 100 - 25 = 78

Simplifying the equation:
(x - 38 + 12) + 75 = 78
x - 26 + 75 = 78
x + 49 = 78
x = 29

The final answer is: 29"
"To find the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut first. 

The initial length of her hair was 10 inches, and it was cut to 8 inches. So, the length of hair cut is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost of the haircut is 2 * $30 = $60.

The cost of the color is $40.

The total cost of the haircut and color is $60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To find out how much Jen will receive, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total earnings. 

First, let's calculate her total hours worked in April. 
Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. 
There are 4 weeks in April. 
Total hours worked in a week = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week
Total hours worked in April = 45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Now, let's calculate her total earnings. 
Her hourly rate is $1.5. 
Total earnings from hours worked = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Jen also receives an additional $10 for complete attendance.

"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we first need to find the total number of red pens and black pens separately.

Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

Since Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens, the total number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

The total number of pens Alain has is the sum of red and black pens, which is 25 + 50 = 75 pens.

"To find the total cost, we first need to find the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. So, the cost per bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of cognac per bottle is 50% more than the cost of scotch per bottle. 50% of $60 is $30, so the cost of cognac per bottle is $60 + $30 = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let x be the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The problem states that ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8.

We are told that this expression is equal to 40, so we can set up the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the total volume of the jar, we need to multiply the length, width, and height of the jar. 

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume used by the jelly beans will be 80% of the total volume. 

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of one jelly bean.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people.

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first stop, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we can find out how much seasoning he needs. He adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat.

Total pounds of meat needed = 5
Seasoning per pound = 2 tablespoons

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the width of one window by the total number of windows. 

Width of one window: 35 inches
Number of windows: 5

Total width of windows = 35 inches/window * 5 windows = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Fabric needed = 2 * 175 inches = 350 inches

The final answer is: 350"

"To find the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we need to calculate the amount of rain on Monday and then the amount of rain on Tuesday.

The amount of rain on Monday is given as 2 inches.

The amount of rain on Tuesday is expected to be 1 more inch than twice the amount of rain on Monday. 

Twice the amount of rain on Monday is 2 * 2 = 4 inches.
1 more inch than twice the amount of rain on Monday is 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

So, the total inches of rain on Tuesday will be 5 inches.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let the number of cupcakes Carly made be 'c'. Since she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, the number of brownies she made is 3c - 2.

The total number of treats (cupcakes + brownies) is 5 * 2 = 10, since each person gets 2 treats.

We can set up an equation to represent this situation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10.

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12.

Divide both sides by 4: c = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount, and then add the cost of the nail art.

The original cost of the manicure and pedicure is $35 + $40 = $75.

The discount is 20% of $75, which is 0.2 x $75 = $15.

So, the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers, the total cost of the nail art is 10 x $3 = $30.

The total cost is the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of the nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"

"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to calculate the price after the increase in December and then the decrease in January.

In December, the price increased by 80% of $40. 
80% of $40 is 0.8 x $40 = $32.
So, the price in December is $40 + $32 = $72.

In January, the price decreased by 50% of $72.
50% of $72 is 0.5 x $72 = $36.
So, the price in January is $72 - $36 = $36.

The final price of the toy after the discount in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the standard lessons and the veteran lessons separately and then add them together.

For the standard lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. So, the total amount from standard lessons is 4 * $80 = $320.

For the veteran lessons, Charlie reduces his rate by 25%. This means he charges 75% of his standard rate. 75% of $80 is 0.75 * $80 = $60. He has 2 lessons at this rate, so the total amount from veteran lessons is 2 * $60 = $120.

Now, we add the total amount from standard lessons and veteran lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make: $320 + $120 = $440.

The final answer is: $440"

"To find out how many apples Walter ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60. 

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, we need to find out how many apples were left. 

60 - 24 = 36

Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. 

25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. Now, we need to find out how many apples were left.

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. 

27 * 3 = 81

"Let's break down the information given:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books that one bookcase can hold: 
10 (middle shelf) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 45 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases she needs to hold all of them. To do this, we'll divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold:
110 / 45 = 2.44

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we need 3 bookcases to hold all of her books.

First, let's find out how many questions she got right on the first test. 
60% of 70 questions is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions right, we need to find the total number of questions. Let's assume the total number of questions is x. 
70% of x is 0.7x. We know that 0.7x = 42 + y, where y is the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test.

We also know that the total number of questions is the sum of the questions on both tests, which is 70 + 40 = 110 questions. 
So, x = 110.

Now we can substitute x into the equation 0.7x = 42 + y. 
0.7 * 110 = 42 + y
77 = 42 + y
y = 77 - 42
y = 35

"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

"To find the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we need to calculate the total amount of food consumed by the German Shepherds and the Bulldogs separately and then add them together.

The 3 German Shepherds consume 5 kilograms each per day, so the total amount of food consumed by the German Shepherds per day is:
3 * 5 = 15 kilograms

The 2 Bulldogs consume 3 kilograms each per day, so the total amount of food consumed by the Bulldogs per day is:
2 * 3 = 6 kilograms

The total amount of food consumed by both the German Shepherds and the Bulldogs per day is:
15 + 6 = 21 kilograms

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total amount of food needed in a week is:
21 * 7 = 147 kilograms

"To find the total number of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals and the 4-legged animals separately and then add them together.

For 2-legged animals: 10 animals * 2 legs per animal = 20 legs
For 4-legged animals: 15 animals * 4 legs per animal = 60 legs

Now, let's add the total number of legs from both types of animals: 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

Since the question asks for pairs of animal legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the number of pairs: 80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the information given. 

The tower is made of 4 blue blocks. 
There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.
The total number of blocks is 32, and we already know that 4 + 8 = 12 blocks are blue and yellow. 
To find the number of red blocks, we subtract the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 32 - 12 = 20.

"To find the distance Elvis traveled west, we multiply the speed by the time: 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles. 

To find the distance Elvis traveled east, we multiply the speed by the time: 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the difference between the two distances to determine how far he is from his house now. 

The distance traveled west is 90 miles, and the distance traveled east is 144 miles. The difference is 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

Initial value of the boat = $9000

Depreciation in the first year = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Depreciation in the second year = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Depreciation in the third year = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after the third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to find the number of orange and yellow candies. 

The bag has 54 red candies. It has twice that amount of orange candies, so the number of orange candies is 54 * 2 = 108.

The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

We know the total number of candies is 232. We can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total.

Number of pink candies = Total number of candies - (Number of red candies + Number of orange candies + Number of yellow candies)
= 232 - (54 + 108 + 27)
= 232 - 189
= 43

"To find the total weight of the car, luggage, and children, we need to add the weight of the car, luggage, and the weight of the two children.

Total weight = weight of car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + (75 * 2)
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to find 1% of 1600.

Force needed = 1% of 1600
Force needed = (1/100) * 1600
Force needed = 0.01 * 1600
Force needed = 16 pounds

"To find out how many hot dogs John needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party. 

There are 20 guests and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs, so the total number of hot dogs needed is 20 * 2 = 40. 

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over, so he only needs to buy 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs.

Since each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, we need to find out how many packs John needs to buy. 

To do this, we divide the total number of hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs in each pack: 36 / 6 = 6.

"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws he will use and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, he will need 4 x 8 = 32 screws in total.

James has 40 screws, and he will use 32 screws, so he will have 40 - 32 = 8 screws left over.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we first need to determine the number of eggs in the second basket. Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as in the first, we multiply the number of eggs in the first basket by 2.

Number of eggs in the first basket: 10
Number of eggs in the second basket: 10 * 2 = 20

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets to find the total.

Total number of eggs: 10 + 20 = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount raised by each girl and add them together.

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430. So, Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. So, Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we add the amounts raised by each girl: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron.
2. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
3. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if Vanessa runs 4 miles, Aaron would run half the distance, which is 2 miles.

Now, we know Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes. To find out how long it would take Vanessa to run 4 miles, we need to find out how long it takes her to run 1 mile. 

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, it would take Vanessa twice as long to run 2 miles as it took Aaron. So, it would take Vanessa 16 * 2 = 32 minutes to run 2 miles.

To find out how long it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile, we divide 32 minutes by 2, which is 16 minutes.

Now, since Vanessa runs 4 miles, and it takes her 16 minutes to run 1 mile, it would take her 4 * 16 = 64 minutes to run 4 miles.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line

However, the caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. So, we need to subtract this from the total amount of line required.

600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate their daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

Daily earnings = (2 meals * $5) + $5 (bottle of wine) = (2 * $5) + $5 = $10 + $5 = $15
Daily earnings = $15

Since they are open 2 days a week, their weekly earnings = daily earnings * 2 = $15 * 2 = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"To find the cost price of each watermelon, we need to divide the total cost by the number of watermelons. 

Cost of 50 watermelons = $80
Cost of 1 watermelon = $80 / 50
Cost of 1 watermelon = $1.60

Now, let's find the selling price of each watermelon. The profit is 25% of the cost price.

Profit = 25% of $1.60
Profit = 0.25 * $1.60
Profit = $0.40

Selling price of 1 watermelon = Cost price + Profit
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $1.60 + $0.40
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $2

The selling price of each watermelon is $2."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. James is now twice as old as Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that James is 2 * 12 = 24 years old now.
2. Since James is 24 years old now, and he was born when John was 19, John is now 24 + 19 = 43 years old.
3. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, which means the youngest son is 43 - 32 = 11 years old now.
4. In 3 years, the youngest son will be 11 + 3 = 14 years old.

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's break down the problem. 

Ana peels 1 orange in 3 minutes, so in 1 hour (60 minutes), she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels 1 orange in 4 minutes, so in 1 hour (60 minutes), she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

To find out how many more oranges Ana has peeled than Jane, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peeled from the number of oranges Ana peeled: 20 - 15 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor cost.

The original cost of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, so he pays 20% of the original cost. 
20% of $400 is 0.2 x $400 = $80.

The labor cost is $50 per hour for 3 hours, so the total labor cost is $50 x 3 = $150.

The total cost is the cost of the radiator plus the labor cost: $80 + $150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write the equation:

2C + 4W = 70

We can solve the first equation for W:

W = 20 - C

Now, substitute this expression for W into the second equation:

2C + 4(20 - C) = 70

Expand the equation:

2C + 80 - 4C = 70

Combine like terms:

-2C + 80 = 70

Subtract 80 from both sides:

-2C = -10

Divide both sides by -2:

C = 5

So, there are 5 chickens on the farm."
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, let's find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. 

Total slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

There are 4 people in total, including Henry and his 3 friends. 

Slices per person = Total slices / Number of people = 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person

The final answer is: 14"
