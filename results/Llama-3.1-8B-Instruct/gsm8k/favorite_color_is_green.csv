"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

Now, we subtract the number of eggs she uses from the total number of eggs she lays: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. To find out how much she makes, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg: 9 * 2 = 18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we have:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber together:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we need to first find the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

Let's denote the increased value as x. We can set up the equation: 
80,000 + 50,000 = x + 1.5x (since 150% is the same as 1.5 times the original value)

Combine like terms: 
130,000 = 2.5x

Divide both sides by 2.5: 
x = 52,000

So the total value of the house after the repairs is $52,000. 

To find the profit, we need to subtract the original cost of the house from the new value: 
Profit = 52,000 - 80,000 - 50,000 (the cost of repairs)
Profit = 52,000 - 130,000
Profit = -78,000

However, since Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, we should only subtract the original cost of the house from the new value to find the profit from the sale of the house. 
Profit = 52,000 - 80,000
Profit = -28,000

However, Josh also spent $50,000 on repairs, so we need to add that to the profit to find the total profit. 
Total profit = -28,000 + 50,000
Total profit = 22,000

The final answer is: $22,000"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

James runs 3 sprints in a session, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to find out the total number of cups of feed she gives her chickens in a day. 

In the morning, she gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens 25 cups of feed. So, the total number of cups of feed she gives her chickens in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi gives each of her chickens 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in a day is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

Since she has already given her chickens 40 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon, she needs to give them 60 - 40 = 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * 5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * 3 = $1.8. 
We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass. 

The sequence of the cost of the glasses is: $5, $3, $1.8, $1.08, $0.64, $0.384, $0.2304, $0.13824, $0.0829376, $0.04956256, $0.029837696, $0.017902816, $0.0107458496, $0.00644751424, $0.003823477632, $0.002294028784, $0.0013764173696.

To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of all the glasses. However, we can also use a formula to simplify the calculation. 

Let's denote the cost of the first glass as a, and the number of glasses as n. The cost of the second glass is 0.6a, the cost of the third glass is 0.6 * 0.6a = 0.36a, and so on. The cost of the nth glass is 0.6^(n-1)a. 

The total cost is the sum of the cost of all the glasses: a + 0.6a + 0.36a + ... + 0.6^(n-1)a. 

This is a geometric series with the first term a, the common ratio 0.6, and n terms. The sum of a geometric series is given by the formula: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where r is the common ratio.

In this case, a = 5, r = 0.6, and n = 16. 

S = 5 * (1 - 0.6^16) / (1 - 0.6) = 5 * (1 - 0.00006103515625) / 0.4 = 5 * 0.99993896484375 / 0.4 = 5 * 2.49959726671875 = 12.49748633359375

The total cost is approximately $12.50."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Seattle has 20 sheep.
- Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
- Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle: 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to calculate the time taken for the first part of the download, the time taken for the restart, and the time taken for the second part of the download.

First, let's find the time taken for the first part of the download. Carla can download 2 GB/minute. The file is 200 GB, so the time taken for the first part of the download is:

Time = Total size / Download speed
Time = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 100 minutes

40% of the file is 200 * 0.4 = 80 GB. Carla has already downloaded 80 GB, so she has 200 - 80 = 120 GB left to download.

The time taken for the second part of the download is:

Time = Total size / Download speed
Time = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 60 minutes

The time taken for the restart is given as 20 minutes.

The total time taken is the sum of the time taken for the first part of the download, the time taken for the restart, and the time taken for the second part of the download:

Total time = 100 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes
Total time = 180 minutes

The final answer is: 180"
"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled in the first 3 hours and the distance he traveled in the last 4 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time

For the first 3 hours, John drove at 60 mph:
Distance = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

For the first 2 hours of the return trip, John was stuck in traffic, so he didn't move:
Distance = 0 miles

For the next half-hour, John drove at 30 mph:
Distance = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

For the remaining 2.5 hours of the return trip, John drove at 80 mph:
Distance = 80 * 2.5 = 200 miles

Total distance traveled in the return trip = 15 + 200 = 215 miles

Since John was driving back home, we need to subtract the distance he traveled from home to the point where he turned around (180 miles) from the total distance he traveled in the return trip (215 miles) to find the distance he is from home:
Distance from home = 215 - 180 = 35 miles

The final answer is: 35"
"To find Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is $10 * 1.2 = $12/hour. 
So, her earnings for the overtime hours are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings for the week = $400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads from each month together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total revenue it generates each year.

The initial cost of the tree is $90. 

Each year, the tree generates revenue from selling lemons. Since the tree grows 7 lemons per year and each lemon sells for $1.5, the total revenue per year is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

However, it also costs $3 to water and feed the tree each year. So, the net revenue per year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

To find out how many years it will take for the tree to start earning money, we need to find the break-even point, which is when the total revenue equals the initial cost of the tree. 

Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. The total revenue after 'x' years is $7.5x, and the total cost is $90. We set up the equation:

7.5x = 90

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides by 7.5:

x = 90 / 7.5
x = 12

So, it will take 12 years for the tree to start earning money.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.
2. She sold 2 more at the red house.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house.
4. She has 5 vacuum cleaners left.

Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as x.

From point 1, Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she has (2/3)x left after the green house sale.

From point 2, she sold 2 more at the red house, so she has (2/3)x - 2 left after the red house sale.

From point 3, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she has (1/2)((2/3)x - 2) left after the orange house sale.

From point 4, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

(1/2)((2/3)x - 2) = 5

To solve for x, we need to isolate x:

(1/2)((2/3)x - 2) = 5
(2/3)x - 2 = 10
(2/3)x = 12
x = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is 4, and the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance is also 4. So, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To maximize profit, the merchant should choose the item that will increase in value the most. 

First, calculate the increase in value for each item:

Jewelry: 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125
Electronic gadgets: 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96

Since $125 is greater than $96, the merchant should choose the jewelry. 

The profit will be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. 

On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance.

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles.

"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in 4 weeks and then multiply it by the number of eggs she eats per day.

There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will have 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Claire eats 3 eggs per day, so in 28 days, she will eat 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she eats in 4 weeks.

84 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 7 dozens.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total time Marissa wants to take to complete the 12-mile trail, we need to divide the total distance by her desired average speed. 

Total distance = 12 miles
Desired average speed = 4 miles per hour
Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles, she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance. 

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance already walked
Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles
Remaining distance = 6 miles

To find the speed needed to walk the remaining distance, we need to divide the remaining distance by the remaining time.

Remaining time = Total time - Time already taken
Remaining time = 3 hours - 2 hours
Remaining time = 1 hour

Speed needed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Speed needed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed needed = 6 miles per hour

"To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. 

Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the remaining one-third is non-water. So, the amount of non-water in the orange drink is 10 - 6.67 = 3.33 liters.

Now, to find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, we need to calculate three-fifths of 15 liters.

Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Since we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of the orange drink. The remaining amount of the orange drink is 10 - 1 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the remaining amount of the orange drink to the pineapple drink to get the total amount of the mixture. The total amount of the mixture is 9 + 15 = 24 liters.

The amount of water in the orange drink that we are keeping is 6.67 liters, and the amount of water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters. So, the total amount of water in the mixture is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

The final answer is: 15.67"

The first 3 customers buy one DVD each, so they bought a total of 3 DVDs.
The next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so they bought a total of 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so we don't need to add anything to the total.

The total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 7."

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since the book was sold with a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of 'x', which is 0.25x. 

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so it is x - 0.25x = 0.75x. We are given that the discounted price is $19.50. 

Now, we can set up the equation: 0.75x = 19.50. 

To solve for 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75. 

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples, we need to multiply the cost of each item by the quantity and add them together.

Cost of milk: 5 packs * $3 = $15
Cost of apples: 4 apples * $1.50 = $6
Total cost of chicken, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Now, we need to subtract the total cost of the chicken, milk, and apples from the total amount paid by Marie to find the cost of the pizza boxes.

Cost of pizza boxes: $50 - $33 = $17

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can divide the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box to find the number of boxes ordered.

Number of boxes of pizza: $17 / $8.50 = 2

"Let's denote the cost of the more expensive pair of heels as x. Since the other pair costs twice as much, the cost of the less expensive pair is 2x.

We know that the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = boots - 5

Combine like terms:

3x = boots - 5

We also know that one pair of heels costs $33, which is the more expensive pair. So, we can set up the equation:

x = 33

Now we can substitute x into the previous equation:

3(33) = boots - 5

99 = boots - 5

Add 5 to both sides:

104 = boots

The boots cost $104.

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age: 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109

Number of dogs: 10
Time per dog: 0.5 hours

Total time per day = Number of dogs * Time per dog
Total time per day = 10 * 0.5
Total time per day = 5 hours

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the total time per day by 7 to find the total time spent in a week.

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We know that G = S + 30. We also know that the total number of coins is 110, so S + G = 110.

Substituting G = S + 30 into the second equation, we get S + (S + 30) = 110. Simplifying this, we get 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2S = 80. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30. G = 40 + 30 = 70.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys. 

60 yogurts / 4 yogurts per set = 15 sets.

Now, we multiply the number of sets by the price per set to find the total cost. 

15 sets * $5.00 per set = $75.00

"To find out how much money John made from selling the Lego sets, we need to multiply the number of sets by the price per set. 

13 sets * $15/set = $195

Then, we need to find out how much money John spent on video games. 

8 games * $20/game = $160

Since John had $5 left after buying the video games, we can find out how much he spent in total by adding the money he had left to the money he spent on video games.

$160 (spent on video games) + $5 (left) = $165

Now, we can find out how much money John made from selling the Lego sets by subtracting the total amount he spent from the total amount he made.

$195 (made from Lego sets) - $165 (spent) = $30

However, this is the amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets, not the number of sets. To find the number of sets, we need to divide the amount of money he made by the price per set.

$30 / $15/set = 2

So, John still has 13 - 2 = 11 Lego sets left. 

The final answer is: 11"
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his total running time and then divide the total distance by the total time.

John runs 3 hours the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

Total running time = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours

Since John runs 60 miles a week and 3 days a week, we can also calculate his average daily running distance as 60 miles / 3 days = 20 miles per day.

However, to find his speed, we need to calculate his total running time in hours per week. Since he runs 3 days a week, we can multiply his daily running time by 3: 6 hours * 3 = 18 hours per week.

Now, we can calculate his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time: 60 miles / 18 hours = 3.33 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 3.33"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out Dana's walking speed first. Since she can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Since Dana's running speed is four times her walking speed, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours she spends walking and running. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, in 6 hours, she spends 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours running and 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is 6 * 2 = 12 miles, and the distance she travels while walking is 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles.

The total distance she can travel in six hours is 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

The final answer is: 18"

"To find the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone, we need to multiply the original distance by 3. 

Original distance = 400 feet
Distance with gemstone = 400 * 3 = 1200 feet

Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1000 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the javelin. However, we need to find the distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames. 

Distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames = 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet

"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total cost. Since Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, to make 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.

Total cost = $10.00

Next, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles.

Total revenue = 20 candles * $2.00/candle = $40.00

Now, let's find the net profit. Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= $40.00 - $10.00
= $30.00

The final answer is: $30.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Total number of articles written in 3 days = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since it takes 4 hours to write one article, the total number of hours spent writing articles is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to first determine how many Post-it notes she used in total. 

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work. To find the total number of Post-it notes she used, we add 80 and 220: 80 + 220 = 300. 

Since she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, we need to subtract 23 from the total number of Post-it notes she used to find out how many she purchased: 300 - 23 = 277.

The final answer is: 277"
"To find the total amount spent on ties, we first need to determine the number of blue ties and the cost of red ties.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per tie:
200 / 40 = 5 blue ties

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is 1.5 times the cost of each blue tie:
1.5 * 40 = 60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties:
10 * 60 = 600

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:
200 + 600 = 800

First, let's find out how many eggs are produced per week: 
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since eggs are sold in dozens, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens: 
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total amount Lloyd makes per week: 
147 dozen eggs * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

"To find the total time Tom spent traveling, we need to calculate the time he spent traveling from 1 to 4 PM and the time he spent traveling back.

The distance from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours. Since Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour, the distance is 3 hours * 10 miles per hour = 30 miles.

The time it took to travel 30 miles at 10 miles per hour is 30 miles / 10 miles per hour = 3 hours.

Now, let's calculate the time it took to travel back. The distance is the same, 30 miles. Since Tom's ship can travel at 6 miles per hour, the time it took to travel back is 30 miles / 6 miles per hour = 5 hours.

The total time Tom spent traveling is 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours.

"To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the total weight of the comic books he removed. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removed 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books already removed weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys to be removed can be calculated by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

"To find the revenue earned on Thursday, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately and then add them together. 

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday: 6 * $60 = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday: 4 * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

To find the revenue earned on Friday, we need to calculate the revenue from car tires only since no truck tires were repaired.

Revenue from car tires on Friday: 12 * $40 = $480

Now, we need to compare the revenues earned on Thursday and Friday to find the day with higher revenue. 

Thursday's revenue: $520
Friday's revenue: $480

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 

To find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the revenue of the day with lower revenue from the revenue of the day with higher revenue.

$520 - $480 = $40

Then, multiply the result by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600

The total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's denote the number of games the team lost as L and the number of games they won as W. We know that W = L + 8 and the total number of games played is 22, so L + W = 22.

Substituting W = L + 8 into the second equation, we get L + (L + 8) = 22. Simplifying this, we get 2L + 8 = 22.

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2L = 14. Dividing both sides by 2, we get L = 7.

Now that we know L = 7, we can find W by substituting L into the equation W = L + 8. W = 7 + 8 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of years Gene has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of vacations he goes on per year.

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34, so he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

He goes on 4 vacations per year, so the total number of quilt blocks is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time it went off and add them together.

The first time it went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after the 10% increase for five years, and then calculate the increase for the next three years.

Initial salary: $600
Increase after 5 years: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 5 years: $600 + $60 = $660

Now, we need to calculate the increase for the next three years:
Increase after 6 years: 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 6 years: $660 + $66 = $726
Increase after 7 years: 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 7 years: $726 + $72.60 = $798.60
Increase after 8 years: 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 8 years: $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46
Increase after 9 years: 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.85
Salary after 9 years: $878.46 + $87.85 = $966.31

The final answer is: $966.31"
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as H. Since Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10H.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is given as 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

16 (invited guests) - (1/4 * 16) = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of guests who will attend by 0.75.

12 (guests) * 0.75 (gift bags per guest) = 9

Now, we multiply the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag to find the total cost.

9 (gift bags) * $2 (cost per gift bag) = $18

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount eaten by adults and children separately and then add them together.

Adults will eat 20 * 10 = 200 pounds of potato salad.

Children will eat half as much as adults, so they will eat 5 * (10 / 2) = 5 * 5 = 25 pounds of potato salad.

The total amount of potato salad needed is 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we first need to determine the total volume of the tomatoes before they were cooked. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and the tomatoes lost half their volume, the total volume of the tomatoes before cooking must be 2 times the volume of the sauce, which is 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Since each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can divide the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can to find out how many cans Freda used: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so we can multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can to find the total number of tomatoes: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total cars that drove through the traffic jam = cars in the first 15 minutes + cars in the remaining 15 minutes
- Cars in the remaining 15 minutes = 20

Let's represent the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. Then, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20 = 25.

To find the value of 'x', we need to solve the equation:
x + 20 = 25
x = 25 - 20
x = 5

"To find the inner volume of one box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the dimensions of the box and then multiply the resulting dimensions.

The length of the box is 5 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner length is 5 - 2 = 3 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side).

The width of the box is 6 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner width is 6 - 2 = 4 inches.

The height of the box is 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner height is 4 - 2 = 2 inches.

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions: 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3: 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

"Let's break down the total time Frankie watched TV each day:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: Let's call the number of 30-minute episodes x. So, the total time on Wednesday is 30x minutes.
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes) = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

The total time Frankie watched TV is 7 hours, which is equal to 420 minutes. We can set up an equation to represent the total time:

1 + 1 + 30x + 1.5 + 2 = 420

Combine like terms:
35.5 + 30x = 420

Subtract 35.5 from both sides:
30x = 384.5

Divide both sides by 30:
x = 12.81666667

Since we can't have a fraction of an episode, we'll round down to the nearest whole number because you can't watch a fraction of an episode. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of 30-minute episodes, and the answer is a decimal, so we will round down to 12.81666667 is approximately 12.8, but since you can't watch 0.8 of an episode, we will round down to 12, but we need to check if 12 is the correct answer.

12 * 30 = 360 minutes
1 + 1 + 360 + 1.5 + 2 = 364.5

Since 12 is not the correct answer, we will round up to 13 and check if it is the correct answer.

13 * 30 = 390 minutes
1 + 1 + 390 + 1.5 + 2 = 395.5

Since 13 is not the correct answer, we will round down to 12 and up to 13 and see which one is correct. We already know that 12 is not the correct answer, so we will try 12.8.

12.8 * 30 = 384 minutes
1 + 1 + 384 + 1.5 + 2 = 389.5

Since 12.8 is not the correct answer, we will round up to 13 and down to 12 and see which one is correct. We already know that 12 is not the correct answer, so we will try 12.8.

12.8 is the correct answer, but we need to round it to the nearest whole number."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.
2. This year, Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so he bakes 2x cookies.
3. However, he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.
4. After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.
5. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110.
6. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 2x = 100.
7. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 50.

2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

From point 1, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

From point 2, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This means that the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 300 / 50 = 6.

"To find the total cost of the lumber, we need to calculate the cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards and the 4 x 4 x 10 boards.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 per board = $100.
The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. 

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 per board.
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 per board.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.
The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 per board = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. This means Lylah's salary was 100% - 30% = 70% of Adrien's salary. If Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, then Lylah's salary four years ago was 0.7 * $40000 = $28000.

2. Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%. To find his new salary, we need to calculate 40% of his old salary and add it to his old salary. 40% of $40000 is 0.4 * $40000 = $16000. So, Adrien's new salary is $40000 + $16000 = $56000.

3. Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, we need to find her new salary. We know that her old salary was $28000. To find her new salary, we need to calculate the percentage increase in Adrien's salary, which is 40%. We can assume that Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage. So, 40% of $28000 is 0.4 * $28000 = $11200. Lylah's new salary is $28000 + $11200 = $39200.

4. To find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later, we add their new salaries: $56000 + $39200 = $95200.

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours:
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Now, let's calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distances together to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:

- Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps.
- She puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps.
- After putting stamps on one-third of the letters, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

Since Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters, that means two-thirds of the letters are still in the pile needing stamps. We can set up an equation to represent this:

(2/3) * (number of letters needing stamps) = 60 - 30 (since 30 letters were already stamped)

Simplifying the equation:

(2/3) * (number of letters needing stamps) = 30

To isolate the number of letters needing stamps, multiply both sides by 3/2:

number of letters needing stamps = 30 * (3/2)
number of letters needing stamps = 45

So, there were 45 letters in the pile needing stamps when Jennie began.

The final answer is: 45"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

- Julia bought a package of spoons.
- Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
- Julia used 3 spoons while making the stew.
- After using the spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as 'x'. 

Since Julia's husband gave her 5 spoons, the total number of spoons she had before using any is x + 5. 

After using 3 spoons, the total number of spoons she had left is (x + 5) - 3 = x + 2.

We are told that after using the spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 12

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 12 - 2
x = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of sausages, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages. 

Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 
He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages: 
38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we need to add the number of friends Lily has to the number of friends Amy has. 

Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily has 50 friends, Amy has 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

Now, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to find the cost of each item and multiply it by the quantity.

The cost of each pepper is given as $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of each watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

An orange costs 5 dollars less than what a watermelon costs, so the cost of each orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To find the total time spent by doctors, we need to multiply the number of patients by the average time each patient is seen. 

500 patients * 24 minutes = 12000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total minutes to hours.

12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The hospital pays the doctors $150 an hour, so the total cost is:

200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour, so the total revenue is:

200 hours * $200/hour = $40000

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

$40000 - $30000 = $10000

The final answer is: $10000"
"To find the number of elves left, we need to follow the steps:

1. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. 
   60 / 3 = 20 elves quit.
   So, 60 - 20 = 40 elves are left.

2. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins.
   40 - 10 = 30 elves are left.

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides taken by Pam and Fred and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she took a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he took a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides taken by both Pam and Fred is 4 + 6 = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 * 6 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first determine how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked 4 * 6 = 24 miles on Tuesday.

The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We already know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday, so we can subtract these from the total to find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday: 
41 - 4 - 24 = 13 miles.

"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we first need to determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially has 20 video games, but he lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. To find out how many video games Bobby has, we multiply the number of video games Brian has by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 times the number of video games Brian has is 3 * 15 = 45.

5 fewer than 45 is 45 - 5 = 40.

"To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed in both tests and subtract that from the total number of questions in both tests.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 
Time taken to complete the first test = 75 / 5 = 15 hours. 
Since Mark only had 8 hours, he completed the test in 8 hours. 
So, the number of questions he completed in the first test = 5 * 8 = 40 questions.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 
Time taken to complete the second test = 100 / 5 = 20 hours. 
Since Mark only had 6 hours, he completed 5 * 6 = 30 questions in the second test.

Total questions completed = 40 + 30 = 70 questions.

Total questions in both tests = 75 + 100 = 175 questions.

Questions left incomplete = 175 - 70 = 105 questions.

"To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we need to subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Total number of cars = 20
Number of automatic cars = 12
Number of manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

"Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W. 

We are given that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q. 
We are also given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B. 

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the second equation to get W = 2(2Q), which simplifies to W = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so Q + B + W = 700. 
Substituting B = 2Q and W = 4Q into this equation, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700, which simplifies to 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Now that we know Q = 100, we can find B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200, and W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400.

The final answer is: 400"

Total cost of food items: 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
Total cost of non-food items: 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
Tax = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax to the cost of non-food items:
Total cost of non-food items with tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax:
Total cost = 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

"I think there may be a mistake in the question. It says ""Kim"" has started the business, but then refers to ""Lucas"" in the last sentence. I will assume the correct name is ""Kim"".

To calculate the profit, we first need to find the total income and total expenses. 

Kim has 8 clients (3 current clients + 5 potential clients). Each client will need 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. So, the total number of bottles of bleach needed is 8 * 2 = 16, and the total number of packs of cloths needed is 8 * 1 = 8.

The cost of bleach is 16 * $2 = $32, and the cost of cloths is 8 * $5 = $40. The total expenses are $32 + $40 = $72.

Kim's total income is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income: $92 - $72 = $20.

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare and then multiply it by the number of harvests in a year.

There are 100 pineapples per hectare. Since John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples per year is:
100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples per year by the number of harvests:
1000 pineapples/year * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left return, which is 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees.
   So, the total number of bees that have left and returned is 30 + 15 = 45.
3. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 leave the hive, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
   So, the total number of bees that have left is now 30 + 60 = 90.
4. The number of bees that have left but not returned is 90 - 45 = 45.
5. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left but not returned come back, which is 45 bees.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy.
- James has four times as many friends as Dorothy.
- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook.

Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can represent the number of Dorothy's friends as x. This means Charlie has 3x friends.

We know Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation: 3x = 12

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 12 / 3
x = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find the number of James' friends. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so James has 4 * 4 = 16 friends.

"To find out who wins the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

Steve's distance is 3 miles, which is 5280 feet (since 1 mile = 5280 feet). His speed is 440 feet per minute. 

Time taken by Steve = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Steve = 5280 / 440
Time taken by Steve = 12 minutes

Tim's distance is 2 miles, which is 10560 feet (since 1 mile = 5280 feet). His speed is 264 feet per minute.

Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Tim = 10560 / 264
Time taken by Tim = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 12 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will be the winner. 

To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the time taken by the winner from the time taken by the loser.

Time waited by the winner = Time taken by the loser - Time taken by the winner
Time waited by the winner = 40 - 12
Time waited by the winner = 28 minutes

"To find the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires. 

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and 5 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * 25 cents = $2.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and 3 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * 25 cents = $2.25.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and 1 person came by to get their tire inflated. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1.

The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * 25 cents = $0.25.

Now, let's add up the total cost of inflating all the tires: $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 french fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total number of fries eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
   Now, the total number of fries eaten is 21 + 9 = 30.
4. A raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's denote the total number of fries initially as x. 
   After the seagull and pigeons ate, there were x - 30 fries left. 
   The raccoon ate 2/3 of (x - 30), so the number of fries left after the raccoon is (x - 30) - 2/3(x - 30).
   To simplify this, we can multiply (x - 30) by 1/3 to get 1/3(x - 30), and then subtract 2/3(x - 30) from it to get -1/3(x - 30).
   So, the number of fries left after the raccoon is (x - 30) - 2/3(x - 30) = (1/3)(x - 30).
5. After the raccoon, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. 
   So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.
   To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides to get (1/3)(x - 30) = 6.
   Then, we can multiply both sides by 3 to get x - 30 = 18.
   Finally, we can add 30 to both sides to get x = 48.

"To find the total hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes per day, each lasting 1 hour. So, the total hours per day for these days is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total hours per week for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes per day, each lasting 2 hours. So, the total hours per day for these days is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total hours per week for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week is the sum of the hours for both sets of days, which is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together:

"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

"To find the total cost of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and add them together.

The cost of one action figure is $5.
The cost of one red car is $4.

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, the cost of the doll is 3 * $5 = $15.

The total cost of the 5 red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

The total cost of the 3 action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

The total cost of all the toys is $20 (red cars) + $15 (doll) + $15 (action figures) = $50.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can write an equation:

S = 2B

In 2 years, their ages will be B + 2 and S + 2. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the equation:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can find Seth's age by multiplying Brooke's age by 2:

S = 2B
S = 2 * 8
S = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to first calculate twice the amount of money Ethel has. 

Twice the amount of money Ethel has is 2 * 8 = 16.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The hat costs $25.

The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.

The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
2. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
3. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo.
4. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.

From point 3, we know Sally Four is 8 years old. 
From point 2, we know Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.
From point 1, we know Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now we have the ages of three birds: Sally Four (8), Granny Red (16), and Sally Two (19). 
The only bird left is the one at the Caboose, which is Sally, but we don't know which Sally. However, since Sally Two and Sally Four are already accounted for, the remaining Sally must be Sally Thirtytwo, who is 8 years old.

The total age of the four birds is 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51.

- Student loans: $300 * 1.5 = $450
- Credit card: $200 * 1.5 = $300
- Mortgage: $500 * 1.5 = $750

Now, let's add up the increased minimum payments:
$450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

Since this is the monthly payment, we multiply it by 12 to get the yearly payment:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes, then add the time it takes to cut one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)

Total time to peel all potatoes: 60 * 1.5 minutes = 90 minutes
Total time to cut all potatoes: 60 * (5/60) minutes = 5 minutes

Total time to peel and cut all potatoes: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much they made in total from selling lemonade. 

Let's denote the number of gallons they made as 'g'. Since they get 20 glasses per gallon and each glass is sold for $0.50, the total revenue from selling lemonade is 20 * 0.5 * g = 10g dollars.

The cost of making lemonade is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar per gallon, so the total cost is 3 + 2 = $5 per gallon.

Since they made a profit of $25, we can set up the equation: 
10g - 5g = 25
This simplifies to 5g = 25.

To find the number of gallons, we divide both sides by 5:
g = 25 / 5
g = 5

Now that we know they made 5 gallons, we can find the total cost of lemons:
Cost of lemons = 3 * 5 = $15

Chinese participants = 160

Now, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team was 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls on the Chinese team = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 160 - 60
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 100

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of white carnations first. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and there are 200 pink calla lilies. 

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Then, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x, and we know that 5x = 200. 

To find 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5: 
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. We know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of red roses as 'y'. Then, y = 4x, and we know that x = 40. 
y = 4 * 40
y = 160

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 2, we know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Since Jan is 30 now, two years ago, Jan was 28. Half of 28 is 14. So, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Since Mark was 19 two years ago, Mark is now 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

From point 1, Jean is two years older than Mark. So, Jean is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them up.

The well-rounded team's total time is 55 seconds per runner, and they have 4 runners. So, their total time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's total time is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to count the favorable outcomes and divide by the total number of outcomes. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) and 6 total outcomes. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 or 50%.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to count the favorable outcomes and divide by the total number of outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Now, we need to find the difference in probability and express it as a percentage. The difference in probability is 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

"To find the number of rats in each cage, we first need to find the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters) and the total number of straw pieces given to them. 

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of rats is 3r. 

The total number of hamsters is 10. 

The total number of straw pieces given to rats is 3r * 6 = 18r. 
The total number of straw pieces given to hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50. 

The total number of straw pieces given to small rodents is 160. So, the total number of straw pieces given to rats and hamsters is 160. 

We can set up the equation: 18r + 50 = 160.

Now, let's solve for 'r'. 
18r = 160 - 50
18r = 110
r = 110 / 18
r = 110 / (2 * 9)
r = 55 / 9
r = 6.11 (approximately)

However, since the number of rats must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the equation. We made an error in assuming that the total number of straw pieces given to small rodents is 160. This is incorrect because the problem states that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, but it does not specify that this is the total number of straw pieces given to small rodents. It is likely that this is the total number of straw pieces given to rats and hamsters combined, but we also need to consider the straw given to the rabbits.

The total number of straw pieces given to rabbits is 20. So, the total number of straw pieces given to small rodents (rats and hamsters) and rabbits is 160 + 20 = 180.

Now, let's re-evaluate the equation: 18r + 50 = 180.

18r = 180 - 50
18r = 130
r = 130 / 18
r = 130 / (2 * 9)
r = 65 / 9
r = 7.22 (approximately)

However, since the number of rats must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the equation again.

The total number of straw pieces given to rabbits is 20. So, the total number of straw pieces given to small rodents (rats and hamsters) is 160. The total number of straw pieces given to hamsters is 50. 

The total number of straw pieces given to small rodents (rats and hamsters) is 160. The total number of straw pieces given to hamsters is 50. So, the total number of straw pieces given to rats is 160 - 50 = 110.

"To find the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The initial amount owed is $100.
The monthly interest rate is 2% or 0.02.

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

The total interest is $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

The total amount Mandy should pay is the initial amount plus the total interest: $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

Rounded to two decimal places, the total amount is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to first calculate the total cost and total revenue.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $400. So, we can set up the equation:

$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$8x = $400

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:

x = $400 / $8
x = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, they spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75 on food.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he collects peaches and then multiply it by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the total minutes by the peaches collected per minute:

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks needs per day, we need to first find out how many pounds of insects they need per week and then divide that by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The flock of ducks needs 3.5 pounds of insects per duck per week. Since there are 10 ducks, the total amount of insects needed per week is 3.5 * 10 = 35 pounds.

Now, we divide the total amount of insects needed per week by 7 to find out how many pounds of insects they need per day: 35 / 7 = 5 pounds.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees over 10 years, subtract the trees that die, and then add the initial number of trees.

Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net change in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8.

Over 10 years, the net change is 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

So, Tom has 80 more trees than he started with. 

Initially, Tom had 50 trees. 

After 10 years, he has 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3 (which is 30% as a decimal).

The number of trees that die is 130 * 0.3 = 39.

So, the number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find the number of pink and white flamingos, we need to break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, the number of white flamingos is 6.

The number of pink flamingos left after taking 6 away is 18 - 6 = 12.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is now 12 + 18 = 30.

The number of white flamingos remains the same, which is 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

Number of crayons Violetta can buy: $20 / $2 = 10

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color. 

Total number of crayons Violetta will buy: 2 * 5 = 10

Since Violetta bought 10 crayons and she had $20, we need to find out how much change she will get. 

Cost of 10 crayons: 10 * $2 = $20

Change Violetta will get: $20 - $20 = $0

"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to calculate the total pounds of carrots that will be used by the restaurants and subtract that from the total pounds of carrots available.

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots used = 2 pounds/restaurant * 40 restaurants = 80 pounds

Now, subtract the total pounds used from the total pounds available:

Total pounds available = 200 pounds
Total pounds used = 80 pounds

Pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds available - Total pounds used
= 200 - 80
= 120 pounds

New salary = 2000 + 100 = 2100

Since John got the award on the first day of the year, he will receive the $5000 reward only once. 

Now, let's calculate the total amount he made that year:
Total amount = (New salary * 52 weeks) + $5000

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for the sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni and cheese separately and then add them together.

For the sandwiches, Carl ate 7 days' worth of sandwiches (since it's a week) and used 2 slices per sandwich. So, the total slices used for sandwiches = 7 * 2 = 14.

For the omelets, Carl ate 3 days' worth of omelets and used 3 slices per omelet (since he used one more slice per omelet than per sandwich). So, the total slices used for omelets = 3 * 3 = 9.

For the macaroni and cheese, Carl used 8 slices.

Now, let's add the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni and cheese together: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31.

"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of blue and red pens she bought and add them to the initial number of pens she had.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she had a total of 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens.

She bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply 93 by 6 to get the total score.

Total score needed = 93 * 6 = 558

Next, we add up the scores of the first five tests.

Total of first five tests = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, we need to find the lowest score among the first five tests.

Lowest score = 71

Now, we subtract the lowest score from the total of the first five tests to get the total score without the lowest score.

Total of first five tests without the lowest score = 338 - 71 = 267

Since Brinley needs a total score of 558 for the semester, we subtract the total of the first five tests without the lowest score from the total score needed to find the score she needs on the sixth test.

Score needed on the sixth test = 558 - 267 = 291

"To find the total weight of the chocolate bars, we need to multiply the number of chocolate bars by their weight. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40 = 1000g.

To find the weight of each candied apple, we need to divide the weight of a chocolate bar by 2, since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. So, the weight of each candied apple is 40 / 2 = 20g.

To find the total weight of the candied apples, we need to multiply the number of candied apples by their weight. So, the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20 = 1600g.

To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples. So, the total weight of the bag of candy is 1000 + 1600 = 2600g.

"To find out how much money Sara needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and 2 pairs of shoes cost $20 each, so the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs $70 - $10 = $60 more to buy the jacket and shoes.

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting.

To find out how much she earns from mowing the lawn, we need to subtract the amount she earns from babysitting from the total amount she needs. $60 - $20 = $40.

Since Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we need to divide the amount she needs from mowing the lawn by the amount she earns per mowing. $40 / $4 = 10.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We know that W = R + 2.

The total number of eggs collected is 42, and each red chicken produces 3 eggs, while each white chicken produces 5 eggs. So, the total number of eggs can be represented as 3R + 5W = 42.

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42.

Expanding the equation, we get 3R + 5R + 10 = 42.

Combining like terms, we get 8R + 10 = 42.

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 8R = 32.

Dividing both sides by 8, we get R = 4.

"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park, l = 6 miles and w = 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(l + w)
P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at 3 miles/hour, the time he spends walking is the total distance divided by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

- Day 1: 100 customers
- Day 2: 50 more customers than Day 1, so 100 + 50 = 150 customers
- Total by Day 3: 500 customers

To find the number of customers on Day 3, we need to subtract the total customers on Day 1 and Day 2 from the total by Day 3.

Customers on Day 3 = Total by Day 3 - (Customers on Day 1 + Customers on Day 2)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - (100 + 150)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - 250
Customers on Day 3 = 250

"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

The rate at which water is leaking from each pool is 4 gallons/minute. Since 4 minutes have passed, the amount of water leaked from each pool is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as y gallons. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y gallons.

We know that the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago (x) minus the amount of water leaked (16) is equal to the current amount of water in the small pool (y). So, we can write the equation:

x - 16 = y

We also know that the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago (2x) minus the amount of water leaked (16) is equal to the current amount of water in the big pool (4y). So, we can write the equation:

2x - 16 = 4y

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x in the first equation:

x = y + 16

Substituting this expression for x into the second equation, we get:

2(y + 16) - 16 = 4y

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:

2y + 32 - 16 = 4y

Combine like terms:

2y + 16 = 4y

Subtract 2y from both sides:

16 = 2y

Divide both sides by 2:

8 = y

Now that we know y, we can find x:

x = y + 16
x = 8 + 16
x = 24

Since x is the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago, the amount of water leaked from the small pool is 16 gallons. To find the current amount of water in the small pool, we subtract the leaked amount from x:

y = x - 16
y = 24 - 16
y = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn, which is the sum of the cost of the shoes and the belt. 

Total cost = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Now, we need to divide the total cost by Lori's hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours to work = 44

"To find the total amount Janeth will pay, we need to calculate the total interest she will pay over 12 months. 

First, let's find the interest she will pay each month. 10% of $2000 is 0.1 * 2000 = $200. 

Since she will pay $165 a month, the interest she will pay each month is $200 - $165 = $35.

Now, let's find the total interest she will pay over 12 months. $35 * 12 = $420.

The total amount she will pay is the initial amount plus the interest. $2000 + $420 = $2420.

Since she will pay $165 a month for 12 months, the total amount she will pay is $165 * 12 = $1980.

The remaining balance will be the total amount she will pay minus the initial amount. $2420 - $1980 = $440.

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias. 

First, we know there are 4 roses. 
Then, we know there are 7 more dahlias than roses, so the number of dahlias is 4 + 7 = 11.

Now, we add the number of roses and dahlias: 4 + 11 = 15.

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to find their current ages and then add 3 to each age. 

Given that Harriet is 21 years old now, and Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). 

In three years, their ages will be: 
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3: 
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored. 

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Naomi scored 68 points. Half of 68 is 34. 10 more than 34 is 44. So Yuri scored 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. Naomi scored 68 points. 17 more than 68 is 85. So Brianna scored 85 points.

Now we know that Naomi scored 68 points, Yuri scored 44 points, and Brianna scored 85 points. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points scored by the four students. 

Total points scored by the four students = 251
Points scored by Naomi = 68
Points scored by Yuri = 44
Points scored by Brianna = 85

Points scored by Jojo = Total points - (Points scored by Naomi + Points scored by Yuri + Points scored by Brianna)

"To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we need to first calculate the total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type and buying 14 grass type. 

Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 

After losing 8 water type cards, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.

After buying 14 grass type cards, he has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

The total number of cards James has now is 30 (fire type) + 34 (grass type) + 32 (water type) = 96 cards.

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is (number of water type cards / total number of cards) * 100.

Percentage chance = (32 / 96) * 100 ≈ 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33."
"To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito is $6.50. 
He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. 
So, the total cost of the add-ons is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.
The total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the new total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.

"To find out how many vines Steve needs, we first need to determine how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply this by 7 days in a week.

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve. 

42 tomatoes/week / 2 = 21 tomatoes/week (girlfriend's consumption)

Total tomatoes consumed per week = Steve's consumption + girlfriend's consumption
Total tomatoes/week = 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes/week

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we divide the total tomatoes consumed per week by the number of tomatoes per vine.

63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then convert that to hours.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike receives from his remaining 3 pen pals. Since each of them sends 2 letters a week, and there are 3 of them, the total number of letters he receives is 2 * 3 = 6 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as 'x'. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin was left with (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27 to find the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.
7. Solving the equation 7 + x = 27, we get x = 27 - 7 = 20.

- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
The total calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

The difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

Since the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls, the total number of girls in these two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls in the school is 50% of the total number of students. Let's find the total number of students in the school. 

There are 3 classes with 20 students each, so the total number of students is 3 * 20 = 60.

Since 50% of the students are girls, the total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

However, we already know that the total number of girls in the first two classes is 27. So, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% boys, the total number of boys in the school is also 30.

- Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.
- Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and three fewer cougars than the previous night.

Let's denote the number of cougars Rick killed today as 'x'. Since he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, the number of cougars he killed last night was x + 3.

Since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, the number of wolves he killed today is 3x.

The total number of animals Rick killed last night is 10 (wolves) + 15 (cougars) = 25.

The total number of animals Rick killed today is 3x (wolves) + x (cougars) = 4x.

The total number of animals Rick killed is the sum of the animals he killed last night and today: 25 + 4x.

We are also given that the number of cougars he killed today is three fewer than the previous night, so we can set up the equation: x = (15 - 3).

Solving for x, we get x = 12.

Now we can find the total number of animals Rick killed: 25 + 4x = 25 + 4(12) = 25 + 48 = 73.

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections and then multiply it by the weight of each section. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of 8000 from the total weight. To find 30% of 8000, we multiply 8000 by 0.3: 8000 * 0.3 = 2400.

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making and then divide that by the number of cups of flour needed per dozen cookies.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Since there are 12 cookies in a dozen, we can divide the total number of cookies by 12 to find out how many dozens of cookies Carla is making: 66 / 12 = 5.5 dozen cookies.

Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies, we can multiply the number of dozens of cookies by 2 to find out how many cups of flour Carla needs: 5.5 * 2 = 11 cups of flour.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first find two thirds of 9,300. 

Two thirds of 9,300 can be calculated as (2/3) * 9,300. 

To calculate this, we multiply 9,300 by 2 and then divide by 3. 

9,300 * 2 = 18,600 
18,600 / 3 = 6,200 

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62.00

The final answer is: $62.00"

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $100 + $125 + $175 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the total price of the house, we need to add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee. 

The selling price is $350,000. 
The brokerage fee is 5% of $350,000, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.
The transfer fee is 12% of $350,000, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the difference between the total price and her budget is $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract it from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

"To find the time it takes to heat up to 400 degrees, we need to calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 
So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 20 (to heat up to 300 degrees) + 28 (to heat up to 400 degrees) + 23 (to cook) = 71 minutes.

"To find the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

Each house has 3 bedrooms with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is 3 * 2 = 6. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12.

Each house has 4 additional windows not connected to bedrooms. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is 4 * 2 = 8.

The total number of windows in one house is 12 (from bedrooms) + 8 (additional) = 20. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows is 20 * 2 = 40.

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to find the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is a 1800-stitch project, the total number of stitches for the body and the sleeves is 1800 - 270 = 1530 stitches.

The body takes 900 stitches, so the sleeves take 1530 - 900 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 4/5 * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to find the number of cards that didn't have the letter A, B, or C on them.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 is (2/5) * 80 = 32.

Then, we find the number of cards with the letter B: 1/2 of the remaining 80 - 32 = 48 cards is (1/2) * 48 = 24.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C: 5/8 of the remaining 48 - 24 = 24 cards is (5/8) * 24 = 15.

The number of cards with the letter D is the total number of cards minus the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C: 80 - 32 - 24 - 15 = 9.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: R = 6S
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: (R + 9) = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots per cobra: 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

Since the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras, we divide the number of spots per cobra by 2 to find the number of spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

To find the total number of spots on the mambas, we multiply the number of mambas by the number of spots per mamba: 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

Now, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

To find half the number of spots, we divide the total number of spots by 2: 4900 / 2 = 2450.

"To find the total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for, we need to calculate the total number of team members, coaches, and guests. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. 
Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 
The total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas Maddy needs to buy is 39 / 3 = 13.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12. 
The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36. 
Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we first need to find the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, its speed is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. 

For the car in the fast lane, the time taken is 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours.

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed, it will take twice as long to cover the same distance. 

Time taken by the car in the slow lane = 2 * 8 hours = 16 hours.

1. Ali has 22 medals.
2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
4. Together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, which means they have 1/10 of the total medals given out.

Let's represent the total medals given out as 'x'. Then, 1/10 of x is equal to 39. 

To find x, we multiply both sides by 10:
x = 39 * 10
x = 390

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the time to minutes first. 

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed, we need to first calculate their points after the fourth round.

Initially, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point and still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed:

"To find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day. 

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 3 meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). So, each person consumes 0.2 * 3 = 0.6 kg of rice per day.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.6 * 5 = 3 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per day (3 kg).

42 kg / 3 kg per day = 14 days

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total miles driven, the total cost of driving, and the total bonus given to the driver.

1. Total miles driven: Since John goes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 = 60 miles. 
   Since he goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, the total miles driven per year is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15000 miles.

2. Total cost of driving: He gets charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of driving per year is 15000 * $2 = $30000.

3. Total bonus given to the driver: He gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus given to the driver per year is $150 * 12 = $1800.

4. Total cost per year: The total cost per year is the sum of the total cost of driving and the total bonus given to the driver, which is $30000 + $1800 = $31800.

"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process. 

When a piece of paper is folded, it creates two layers: the front and the back. 

For a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the number of pages on the left and right sides. 

Since page 1 is on the left back, and page 2 is on the left front, we have 2 pages on the left side. 

Similarly, page 32 is on the right back, and page 31 is on the right front, so we have 2 pages on the right side. 

However, we also need to consider the middle pages, which are not folded. Since there are 30 pages in the middle (from page 3 to page 31), we need 15 pieces of paper for the middle pages (since 30 / 2 = 15).

In total, we need 2 pieces of paper for the left side, 2 pieces of paper for the right side, and 15 pieces of paper for the middle pages.

- Books sold in the first year = 2 * Books sold this year = 2 * 45 = 90
- Books sold in the second year = Total books - Unsold books - Books sold this year - Books sold in the first year
= 250 - 50 - 45 - 90
= 65

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
Total money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book
= 65 * 20
= 1300

The final answer is: $1300"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Since Watson gets a $300 bonus each week, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

April has 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for the month are:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to find 20% of 20, since he beat 80% of the people.

"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we first need to determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 
Two-thirds of 60 is 60 * (2/3) = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 
60 - 40 = 20 loaves left.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. 
Half of 20 is 20 * (1/2) = 10 loaves sold in the afternoon.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much weight Sandy loses in a week, we need to divide the total weight lost by Joey in 4 weeks by 4. 

Weight lost by Joey in 4 weeks = 8 pounds
Weight lost by Joey in 1 week = 8 / 4 = 2 pounds

Since Sandy loses the same amount of weight as Joey in a week, Sandy loses 2 pounds per week.

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey in 4 weeks, we need to divide the total weight lost by Joey in 4 weeks by the weight lost by Sandy in a week.

Weight lost by Joey in 4 weeks = 8 pounds
Weight lost by Sandy in a week = 2 pounds
Number of weeks for Sandy to lose the same amount of weight = 8 / 2 = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $13 = $26. The discounted price is 2 * $11 = $22. The savings on the tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 * $1 = $4. The discounted price is 4 * ($1 - $0.5) = 4 * $0.5 = $2. The savings on the packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the total number of new limbs, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs separately and then add them together.

Extra arms: Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days, in 15 days, they will grow 15 / 3 = 5 extra arms.

Extra legs: Since the person grows an extra leg every 5 days, in 15 days, they will grow 15 / 5 = 3 extra legs.

Total new limbs = Extra arms + Extra legs = 5 + 3 = 8

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we need to calculate how much he has spent so far and subtract that from the total amount he has.

1. Cost of business suits: 6 suits * $100 = $600
2. Cost of suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 = $150
3. Cost of the flight ticket: 5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
   The flight ticket costs $700 more than this, so the cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200
4. Total spent so far: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950
5. Total amount saved: $2000
6. Total amount spent on the trip: $6000 - $2000 = $4000

"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to first find the total number of eggs consumed in a day and then multiply it by 7.

There are 5 people in the family. Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs consumed by these 3 people is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs. The rest of the people (5 - 3 = 2) eat 2 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs consumed by these 2 people is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs consumed in a day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we multiply the total number of eggs consumed in a day by 7: 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
2. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
3. The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60000.
4. The population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, so the current population is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

The final answer is: 120000"
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is D/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams: 2D + D + D/2.

We are given that the total number of players is 105. So, we can set up the equation:

2D + D + D/2 = 105

To solve for D, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

D = 30

The number of players on the defense is 30."
"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

2 families with 6 people: 2 * 6 = 12 people
3 families with 4 people: 3 * 4 = 12 people
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24 people

Then, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. 
24 - 8 = 16 people

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people. 
So, 2 people had previous commitments and couldn't come.

Now, subtract the people who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments from the total number of people invited.
16 - 2 = 14 people

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Cost = Volume * cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * 0.1
Cost = 12

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls, nongendered children, and then add them to the number of boys.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls is:
Girls = 3 * Boys = 3 * 30 = 90

The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so the number of nongendered children is:
Nongendered children = (1/10) * Boys = (1/10) * 30 = 3

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Let's assume the number of electric poles is 'x'. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of people who left, we first need to find the total number of people at the party. Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people is 25 + 15 = 40.

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can find the number of people who left by multiplying the total number of people by 1/4. 

Number of people who left = 40 * (1/4) = 10

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3. 

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 left. So, the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, totaling 26 pencils. This means the 3 boxes contain 26 - 2 = 24 pencils.

Since each box contains 24 / 3 = 8 pencils, we can determine that each box holds 8 pencils.

Now, Jam and Meg have a total of 26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils.

To find out how many boxes they need, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box: 72 / 8 = 9.

"To find the total weakening of the coffee, we need to calculate the weakening caused by the ice cubes and the cream separately, then add them together.

Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we need to find out how many ice cubes are used. 

Let's assume the initial temperature of the coffee is 100 degrees (for simplicity). After cooling by 65 degrees, the temperature will be 35 degrees. 

Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, the number of ice cubes used can be calculated as follows:
65 / 13 = 5 ice cubes

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. So, 5 ice cubes will make it 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which weakens the coffee.

The total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening caused by the ice cubes and the cream:
60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out the ratio of old records to new records. Since people can trade 2 old records for 1 new one, the ratio is 2:1. 

Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can set up an equation to find the total number of new records traded. Let's assume x is the number of new records traded. Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, the total number of new records traded is 7. However, since the ratio is 2:1, the total number of old records traded must be 2x. 

Since the total number of new records traded is 7, we can set up the equation 2x = 7. However, this is not correct because the 5 people are trading for 7 new records in total, not each person. So, we need to multiply the number of new records each person gets by the number of people. Since each person gets 7/5 new records, the total number of new records traded is 7. So, we can set up the equation 2x = 7 * 5. 

2x = 35

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 2.

x = 35 / 2
x = 17.5

However, x represents the number of new records each person gets, not the total number of new records. Since the total number of new records is 7, we can set up the equation 17.5 * 5 = 7 * x. However, this is not correct. We need to find the total number of new records traded, not the number of new records each person gets. Since the ratio is 2:1, the total number of new records traded is 7. So, we can set up the equation 2x = 7 * 5. However, this is not correct.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. 
2/5 * 100 = 40 junior programmers.

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, so the total amount paid to junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so they are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

The total amount paid to senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount paid to all programmers is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The final answer is: $224,000"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'. 

Initially, there were x people on the bus. 
At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total became x + 5. 
At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2. 
Then, 8 more people got in, so the total became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6. 
We are given that the total number of people at the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 20. 

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: 
x = 20 - 6 
x = 14

"To find out how many lollipops Oscar has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
2. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
3. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
4. He eats 3 more lollipops that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
5. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first find out how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can find the time it takes to charge 40% by multiplying 40 by 3. 

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 / 60 = 2 hours

"To find the net pay for each job, we need to calculate the total income, subtract the property tax, and then subtract the income tax.

Job A:
- Total income: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year
- Since there's no property tax mentioned for Job A, we'll proceed with income tax only.
- Income tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income for Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Total income: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Income tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net income for Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, let's compare the net incomes of the two jobs:
- Net income for Job A: $24,000
- Net income for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

"Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. 

So, we can write the equation: 
x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 
3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 
3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 70

Since the smallest group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from x:
70 - 10 = 60

"Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as CH. We know that CH = 2C, since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows. We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so C + CH = 60.

Substituting CH = 2C into the equation, we get C + 2C = 60, which simplifies to 3C = 60. Dividing both sides by 3, we get C = 20.

Since CH = 2C, we can substitute C = 20 into this equation to get CH = 2(20) = 40.

Now, we know that cows have 4 legs and chickens have 2 legs. The total number of legs is 4C + 2CH. Substituting C = 20 and CH = 40, we get 4(20) + 2(40) = 80 + 80 = 160.

2. A pink frog weighs the same as a green toad.
3. A pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, which means the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
4. A pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, which means the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
5. A pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
6. A pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:

The factory used to make $100 per tractor and sold 10 tractors a day, so they made $100 * 10 = $1000 per day.

Now, they make $220 per silo and sell 5 silos a day, so they make $220 * 5 = $1100 per day.

The difference in the amount they make per day now and the amount they used to make per day is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100:

"To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we first need to determine how much money he had left after buying the candy. 

Billy started with $10. He spent $1.5 per pound on candy. Let's call the number of pounds of candy he bought 'x'. The total cost of the candy is 1.5x. 

The amount of money he had left after buying the candy is 10 - 1.5x.

He then took half of this amount and spent it on gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05, the total cost of the gumballs is 0.05 * (40 / 2) = 1.

The amount of money he had left after buying the candy is also equal to the amount he spent on gumballs. So, we can set up the equation: (10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 1.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: 10 - 1.5x = 2.

Now, we subtract 10 from both sides: -1.5x = -8.

Dividing both sides by -1.5 gives us x = 16/3.

Now, let's add up the number of people kicked out for each reason:
- Refusing to wear masks: 3
- Shoplifting: 7
- Physical violence: 21

Total number of people kicked out for these reasons: 3 + 7 + 21 = 31

Since a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
50 - 31 = 19

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Erin now has 14 points. Sara scored 8 points. Erin has three times more points than Sara. 

Let's represent Sara's points as S and Erin's points as E. We know that E = 3S. We also know that E = 14. 

Since E = 3S and E = 14, we can set up the equation 3S = 14. 

To find S, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3. 

S = 14 / 3
S = 4.67

Now that we know Sara's points, we can find Erin's points before. We know that Erin now has 14 points. To find Erin's points before, we need to subtract the points Sara scored from Erin's current points. 

Erin's points before = Erin's current points - Sara's points
Erin's points before = 14 - 8
Erin's points before = 6

However, the question asks for Erin's points before she had three times more points than Sara. This means we need to find Erin's points before she scored 14 points. 

Let's represent Erin's points before as E'. We know that E' + 14 = 3S. 

We already know that S = 4.67. 

E' + 14 = 3 * 4.67
E' + 14 = 14
E' = 0

The final answer is: 0"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors. So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of etching the logo on each frame. The etching costs 20% of the cost of the frame, which is 0.2 * $20 = $4. So, the total cost of etching is 44 * $4 = $176.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins, and each pin costs $5. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers. Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12. So, the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, let's add up the costs: $880 (picture frames) + $176 (etching) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1098.

The final answer is: $1098"
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the materials cost first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

Since making it yourself saves 20%, that means you save 20% of $400. 

20% of $400 = 0.2 * $400 = $80

So, the materials cost for making the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $400 - $80 = $320.

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is the materials cost, which is $320.

The final answer is: $320"
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold on each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday.

Total shoes sold on Sunday = 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 
14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest paid over the five months and then divide it by the number of months.

The total interest paid is calculated as follows:
Interest = Principal * Rate * Time
Interest = $3,650 * 10% * 5/12 years
Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5/12
Interest = $3,650 * 0.04167
Interest = $152.025

The total amount to be paid is the principal plus the interest:
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $152.025
Total Amount = $3,802.025

Now, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment:
Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
Monthly Payment = $3,802.025 / 5

"To find the total profit per hour, we need to first find the total profit and then divide it by the number of hours she spends running the stand.

Millie buys supplies for $18 to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade, so she makes a total of 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

She sells each cup of lemonade for $1, so the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is 36 * $1 = $36.

The cost of supplies is $18, so the total profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she makes 36 cups of lemonade, she will spend 36 / 4 = 9 hours selling all the lemonade.

The profit per hour is $18 / 9 = $2.

First, let's find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, she gets 1 pound at the regular price of $3 and 1/2 pound at half off. The half pound is 0.5 pounds. The cost of the half pound is 0.5 * $3 = $1.50. So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. She bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework.

The first package of fireworks costs $400. The second package costs twice that much, so it's 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

He gets a 20% discount on the fireworks. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.20: $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discount amount is subtracted from the total cost: $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150.

The total amount spent is the cost of the fireworks with the discount plus the cost of the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate how many cookies she will eat in 30 days. 

Since she eats 2 cookies a night, and there are 30 days, we multiply 2 cookies by 30 days: 
2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make:
60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen cookies

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two conditions.

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50000 candles smell like wet dog, so the number of candles that smell like wet dog is 0.05 * 50000 = 2500.

Next, we need to find the number of candles that are more dangerous and have a defect. However, the problem doesn't directly give us the percentage of candles that are more dangerous. But we know that 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of the candles are more dangerous. So, the number of candles that are more dangerous is 0.01 * 50000 = 500.

Now, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and are more dangerous. Since 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog, we can find this by multiplying the number of more dangerous candles by 0.05. However, this would be the same as finding 5% of 500, which is 0.05 * 500 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, first, we need to find the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount is 30% of the regular price, which is $20. 
30% of $20 = 0.3 * $20 = $6

So, the discount on each blouse is $6. 
The price of each blouse after the discount is $20 - $6 = $14.

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The combined total of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 30 + 60 + 15 + 45 = 150 apples.
- Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 150 = 350 apples.
- Since Joanne gathers the same amount from the average trees as her sister doesn't, Joanne gathers 350 / 2 = 175 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: 175"
"Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We know that the total number of heads is 180, so we can write an equation based on this information:

C + D = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304. Since camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each, we can write another equation:

2C + D = 304

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system by subtracting the first equation from the second equation to eliminate D:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each part of the trip and add them together.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

In the next 2 days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 km is:
(30/100) * 800 km = 240 km
So, the total distance traveled in the next 2 days is 240 km.

In the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each part of the trip:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The final answer is: 3140"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. This means Zack's locker is 4 times as big as Peter's locker.
3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. This means Timothy's locker is twice as big as Zack's locker.

Now, let's calculate the size of Zack's locker:
Zack's locker = 4 * Peter's locker = 4 * 5 = 20 cubic inches

Now, let's calculate the size of Timothy's locker:
Timothy's locker = 2 * Zack's locker = 2 * 20 = 40 cubic inches

"To find the elevation where Stanley's comb fell, we need to subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation. 

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation where the comb fell: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation where the comb fell and Oliver's elevation.

Elevation where the comb fell: 6,000 feet
Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

"To find out how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from the two banks and add it to his initial capital.

The first bank gave him $4000. 
The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

Total money from banks = $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Now, we add the total money from the banks to his initial capital: 
$12000 + $5000 = $17000.

"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the steps:

1. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats carried away is 4 * 5 = 20.
   Remaining cats = 50 - 20 = 30

2. 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran, we need to calculate 3/5 of 30.
   Number of cats that ran = (3/5) * 30 = 18

3. Now, we need to find the number of cats left on the rock. 
   Cats left on the rock = Remaining cats - Cats that ran
   Cats left on the rock = 30 - 18 = 12

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different price periods.

1. The first 6 months cost $8 per month, so the total cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.
2. The next 8 months cost $12 per month, so the total cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.
3. The remaining months in 2 years (24 months) minus the first 14 months (6 + 8) is 24 - 14 = 10 months. These 10 months cost $14 per month, so the total cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, we add up the costs of all the periods: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The final answer is: $284"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. 
   Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J. 
   We can write the equation: J = T - 6.

2. The total savings is $6. 
   Since Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 2/3 from the tattered jeans. 
   We can write the equation: (1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6.

3. Substitute J from the first equation into the second equation: 
   (1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6.

4. Multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 
   T - 6 + 2T = 18.

5. Combine like terms: 
   3T - 6 = 18.

6. Add 6 to both sides of the equation: 
   3T = 24.

7. Divide both sides of the equation by 3: 
   T = 8.

8. Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans (T = 8), we can find the cost of the jogger jeans (J = T - 6): 
   J = 8 - 6 = 2.

9. The jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, so she has a total of 6 bird feeders.
- The store-bought bird feeders attract 20 birds each.
- The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Since there are 3 store-bought bird feeders, they attract a total of 3 * 20 = 60 birds.
Since there are 3 bird feeders made by Lillian, they attract a total of 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we add the number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders and the number of birds attracted by the feeders Lillian made herself:
60 + 90 = 150

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. 
25% of $4 is 0.25 * 4 = $1. 
So, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5. 
The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: 
$4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how many cards he sold. Since he has $50 in spending cash and the ticket costs $100, he needs to make $50 from selling the cards. 

Let's denote the total number of cards as 'x'. Since he sells each card for $1.5, the total amount he makes from selling the cards is 1.5x. However, he keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he sells 2/3 of the cards. Therefore, the amount he makes from selling the cards is 1.5 * (2/3)x = 1x.

We know that he needs to make $50, so we can set up the equation: 1x = 50.

However, this equation is not correct because it doesn't take into account that he keeps 1/3 of the cards. The correct equation should be 1.5 * (2/3)x = 50.

To solve for x, we need to multiply 1.5 by 2/3, which is 1. So the equation becomes x = 50.

However, this is still not correct because it doesn't take into account that he keeps 1/3 of the cards. The correct equation should be 1 * (2/3)x = 50.

To solve for x, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2, which is the reciprocal of 2/3. 

x = 50 * (3/2)
x = 75

So, Kenny started with 75 cards."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many guests were expected to have two hotdogs. Since half of the 36 guests were expected to have two hotdogs, we can calculate this as follows:

36 / 2 = 18

So, 18 guests were expected to have two hotdogs. This means that 18 guests were expected to have one hotdog each, and 18 guests were expected to have two hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that 40 - 36 = 4 extra guests showed up. Since there were only enough hotdogs for 36 guests, the 4 extra guests will not get a second hotdog.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 4.

The final answer is: 4"

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

1. The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
2. The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
3. The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total cost of the utensils is 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.
4. The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.
5. To apply the 20% discount, we need to find 20% of $165.00, which is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.
6. The discount amount is $33.00, so we subtract this from the total cost before the discount: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to find out how much gas was in one container. 

15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, so each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons of gas.

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, she needed 1/4 * 3 = 0.75 gallons of gas.

There are 8 pints in a gallon, so 0.75 gallons is equal to 0.75 * 8 = 6 pints.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George had left after buying the chips. Since he had 1% of his money left, he spent 99% of his money on chips and candy bars.

Let's assume George had x dollars initially. Then, 99% of x is the amount he spent. We know that he spent $5, so we can set up the equation:

0.99x = 5

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.99:

x = 5 / 0.99
x = 5.05

So, George had $5.05 initially.

Now, let's find out how much he spent on chips. Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, or $0.40. He bought 3 bags, so the total cost of chips is:

3 * 0.40 = 1.20

He spent $1.20 on chips, and he had $5.05 initially, so he had $5.05 - $1.20 = $3.85 left after buying the chips.

Since he had 1% of his money left, the amount he spent on candy bars is 99% of $5, which is $4.95. We know that each candy bar costs $0.75, so the number of candy bars he bought is:

4.95 / 0.75 = 6.6

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 6 candy bars with $4.50 and have $0.45 left, which is not enough to buy another candy bar. Therefore, the number of candy bars he bought is 6.

The final answer is: 6"

"To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to determine how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then add 5 minutes to that time.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne's 4-minute drive. So, Bernadette needs to leave 4 - 5 = -1 minute before Wayne. However, since Bernadette can't leave a negative amount of time before Wayne, we need to calculate how much earlier she should leave in total.

Since Bernadette's drive is 16 minutes, and she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne, she should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before the event. 

However, since we are looking for how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to subtract Wayne's drive time from Bernadette's total time. So, Bernadette should leave 21 - 4 = 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. Since the area of the room is given as 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length to feet. 

1 yard = 3 feet
So, 3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:
Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room:
Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase due to the oven is 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.

The window is open for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open, so for 30 minutes, it cools down 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. The temperature increase due to the oven is 15 degrees, and the temperature decrease due to the open window is 6 degrees. 

So, the final temperature of the house is 40 + 15 - 6 = 49 degrees.

"To find the time it took James to do the run, we first need to find the total time it took James to complete the triathlon. 

First, let's convert Jon's times to minutes: 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's find James' time for the swim. James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. 
10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. 
So, James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

James' bike time is 5 minutes longer than Jon's, so it is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, we can find James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time: 
180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to calculate the distance it runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, we need to convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 

Distance = Speed * Time = 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each on Monday, so the revenue from Monday's sale is:
17 * $20 = $340

The salesman sold the rest of the sneakers (48 - 17 = 31) to a department store for $25 each throughout the rest of the week. The revenue from this sale is:
31 * $25 = $775

The total revenue from the sale of sneakers is:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The cost of the case of 48 sneakers is $576. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The final answer is: $539"
"To find the total number of crayons, we need to calculate the number of crayons in the packets with 8 pieces and the number of crayons in the packets with 16 pieces, then add them together.

The number of crayons in the packets with 8 pieces is 6 * 8 = 48.
The number of crayons in the packets with 16 pieces is 4 * 16 = 64.

Now, we add the number of crayons in both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

The final answer is: 112"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra.
2. The regular price of a soda is $3.
3. You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of the popcorn and soda with the super ticket must be $2 more than the cost of the regular ticket, popcorn, and soda.

Let's denote the regular price of the popcorn as P. The cost of the regular ticket is $12. The cost of the soda is $3. So, the total cost of the regular ticket, popcorn, and soda is $12 + P + $3.

The cost of the super ticket, popcorn, and soda is $20 + $1 = $21. Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, we can set up the equation:

$21 = $12 + P + $3 + $2

Simplifying the equation:

$21 = $17 + P

Subtracting $17 from both sides:

$4 = P

The regular price of the popcorn is $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. 
   To find the cost per balloon, we divide the total cost by the number of balloons: 
   Cost per balloon = Total cost / Number of balloons = $900 / 20 = $45 per balloon.

2. Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. 
   New cost per balloon = Old cost per balloon + Increase in cost = $45 + $20 = $65 per balloon.

3. Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price.
   Total cost = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons = $65 * 170.

The final answer is: $11050"
"To find the average speed, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed * Time
For the first part of the trip: Distance = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles
For the second part of the trip: Distance = 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles
Total distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average speed = 50 mph

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies separately and then add them together.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires is:
8 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $6400

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she now has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.
The value of the 3 sapphires she traded is:
3 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $2400

The value of the 2 rubies she received is:
2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400

Now, let's add the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies:
$6400 (sapphires) + $2400 (value of traded sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $11200

The total value of Jenna's jewels is $11200.

The final answer is: $11200"
"To find the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. So together, they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, we multiply the total number of apples they eat per day by 30:

8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one bed is length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since there are 10 beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we first need to find the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of red cards = 15
60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the number of fairies remaining, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

After 20 minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means 50 / 2 = 25 fairies joined the group.

So, the total number of fairies now is 50 (initial fairies) + 25 (new fairies) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. 

The number of fairies remaining is 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has and the number of puppies Brandon's dog has. 

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. 
Total puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies that have spots. 
Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 
Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies that have spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the weight of each type of feed and add them together.

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Total weight of feed = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips.

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
= 3400 / 2250
= 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns in a week, we need to calculate the total amount from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

For aluminum cans: 
Grayson drinks 3 cans a week. Each can is worth 2 cents. 
So, 3 cans * 2 cents = 6 cents per week from aluminum cans.

For plastic bottles: 
Grayson drinks 5 bottles a week. Each bottle is worth 3 cents. 
So, 5 bottles * 3 cents = 15 cents per week from plastic bottles.

Total earnings per week = 6 cents (aluminum) + 15 cents (plastic) = 21 cents per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly earnings by 4 to find the total earnings in a month:
21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to first determine how many plants Toni has. Since Frederick has 10 plants and Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, so:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to subtract the discount from the total cost of the apples. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples for Becky: 
20 apples * 45 cents = 900 cents
Since there's a $1 discount, we need to convert it to cents: $1 = 100 cents
So, the total cost for Becky is 900 cents - 100 cents = 800 cents
To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 800 cents / 100 = $8

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the apples for Kelly: 
20 apples * 50 cents = 1000 cents
Kelly received a 10% discount, so we need to find 10% of 1000 cents: 
10% of 1000 = 0.1 * 1000 = 100 cents
Now, subtract the discount from the total cost: 1000 cents - 100 cents = 900 cents
To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 900 cents / 100 = $9

Now, let's find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky: 
Kelly paid $9 and Becky paid $8, so Kelly paid $9 - $8 = $1 more.

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

Number of cookies = (1/2)x + 2

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal. To find the new price, we need to calculate 20% of the normal price and add it to the normal price. 
20% of $1500 is 0.2 * $1500 = $300. 
The new price of the hotel is $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the cost of the plane tickets plus the cost of the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

"To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon.

Since the razors are buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Heather also has a $2.00 coupon, so she will get a discount of $2.00.

The total cost of 1 pack of razors after the discount is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, the cost of each individual razor is $2.00 / 4 = $0.50.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

"Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, the number of insects David found is B/2. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so the number of insects Lily found is B/2 + 7.

We are also given that together they collected 43 insects. So, the sum of the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. 

We can write the equation as: B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms: B + B = 2B
Combine B/2 + B/2: B = 2B/2 = B
So the equation becomes: 2B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: B/2 = 18/2 = 9

And the number of insects Lily found is B/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

We know that the total cost is the sum of the costs of all the packs of gum. Let's denote the cost of each strawberry pack as 'x'. 

The total cost equation is: 2x (for the strawberry packs) + 2 (for the grape pack) + 1 (for the green apple pack) = 7.

Combine like terms: 2x + 3 = 7.

Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 4.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2."
"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar spent. 

A 2 x 4 gives 200 sticks for $4, so the cost per stick is $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick. 
A 2 x 8 gives 400 sticks for $6, so the cost per stick is $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick.

Since a 2 x 8 gives more sticks per dollar, we will use this type of wood. 

Now, we need to find out how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with $24. 
$24 / $6 = 4, so he can buy 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood.

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks, 4 pieces will give 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total number of snowshoes needed and then multiply it by the cost per pair.

Each dog has 4 legs, and Mario has 6 dogs. So, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes needed is 24 / 2 = 12 (since each pair has 2 snowshoes).

The cost per pair of snowshoes is $12.00. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of pairs needed by the cost per pair: 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To find out how much Janet spends on bus trips in a week, we need to calculate the cost of two bus trips per day for five days. 

Cost of two bus trips per day = 2 * $2.20 = $4.40
Cost of two bus trips per day for five days = $4.40 * 5 = $22.00

Now, we need to find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass for $20. 

Amount saved = Cost of two bus trips per day for five days - Cost of weekly bus pass
Amount saved = $22.00 - $20.00
Amount saved = $2.00

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The farm has 30 cows.
- The zoo has 20 sheep.
- The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
- The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.
- The total number of animals on the farm is 30 (cows) + 10 (sheep) = 40.
- The total number of animals on the zoo is 60 (cows) + 20 (sheep) = 80.
- The total number of animals on both the farm and the zoo is 40 (farm) + 80 (zoo) = 120.

"Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'. We know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, so Rose bought 4x onions and 4y potatoes.

We are given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. This can be represented as:

4x = 12 (onions)
4y = 4 (potatoes)

To find the values of x and y, we can solve these equations:

4x = 12
x = 12 / 4
x = 3 (onions)

4y = 4
y = 4 / 4
y = 1 (potatoes)

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 3 + 1 = 4."
"To find the number of days Andy has to lose the weight, we need to calculate the difference between his birthday and today. 

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to January 1st is 1 day. 
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. 
February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. 
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. 
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days. 
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days. 
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days. 
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total days = 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 171 days

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 lb, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 
105,000 / 171 ≈ 613.5

The final answer is: 614"
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate his total earnings for the week and subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald earns $30 per day. Since he worked for an entire week (7 days), his total earnings would be:

"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

First, Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes. 
20% of $500 = 0.2 * $500 = $100

Now, Julie has $500 - $100 = $400 left.

Then, she spent 25% of the remaining money on CDs.
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, Julie has $400 - $100 = $300 left.

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000

Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x = 3 * 30,000 = 90,000

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

Total cost: 
- 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each, so the total number of bags is 8 * 5 = 40 bags.
- The total cost is 40 bags * $4 = $160.

Total revenue: 
- She sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue is 40 bags * $8 = $320.

Profit: 
- Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, so profit = $320 - $160 = $160.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Ali has: 
   Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. 
   Total money from $10 bills = 4 * $10 = $40
   Total money from $20 bills = 6 * $20 = $120
   Total money = $40 + $120 = $160

2. Ali gives his sister half of the total money:
   Half of the total money = $160 / 2 = $80
   Money left after giving his sister half = $160 - $80 = $80

3. Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner:
   3/5 of the remaining money = (3/5) * $80 = $48
   Money left after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32

"Let's break down the information given. Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set for an unknown price. The total cost was $48. 

Let's denote the price of the headphone set as 'x'. We can set up the equation as follows:

4 + x = 48

To find the price of the headphone set, we need to subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

x = 48 - 4
x = 44

Now that we know the price of the headphone set, we can find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he had not bought the headphone set. 

Let's denote the number of CDs Tom could have bought as 'y'. We can set up the equation as follows:

4y = 48

To find the number of CDs Tom could have bought, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 4:

y = 48 / 4
y = 12

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he had not bought the headphone set. We already know that he could have bought 12 CDs. 

To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we need to subtract the number of CDs he actually bought from the number of CDs he could have bought:

"To find the number of passengers after the second stop, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus, so 5 * 8 = 40 people get in. The total number of passengers now is:
40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 3 times 21 is 63, but since it's 3 times fewer, we subtract 63 from 21 to get the number of passengers who got in, which is 21 - 63 = -42. However, since you can't have a negative number of passengers, this means that 63 is 3 times more than the number of passengers who got in. So, we need to divide 63 by 3 to get the number of passengers who got in, which is 21. The total number of passengers now is:
59 (left) + 21 (got in) = 80

So, the final number of passengers after the second stop is 80.

   Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.
   Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years.
   So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.
3. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, let's find the difference in their current ages: 
Current age of Jame = 22 years
Current age of his cousin = 47 years

First, let's find the cost of the printer:
Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
Cost of the printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of the printer = $700

Now, let's find the total cost of the computer and the printer:

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Elvis needs to save in the first half of the month. 

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of the month is x. Then, the number of days in the second half of the month is also x (since the month has 30 days, the first half has 15 days and the second half has 15 days).

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves in the first half as y. Then, the amount he saves in the second half is 2y.

The total amount Elvis needs to save in the month is $1125. So, we can set up the equation:

x * y + x * 2y = 1125

Combine like terms:

3xy = 1125

Divide both sides by 3x:

y = 1125 / (3x)

Since x is the number of days in the first half of the month, and we know that the first half of the month has 15 days, we can substitute x = 15:

y = 1125 / (3 * 15)
y = 1125 / 45
y = 25

Now that we know Elvis saves $25 in the first half of the month, we can find out how much he needs to save in the second half:

Amount saved in the second half = 2y
= 2 * 25
= 50

Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the total miles he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 = 6 miles.

Since he works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is 6 * 5 = 30 miles.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice: 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters
2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once: 26 / 2 = 13 letters
3. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written: 52 + 13 = 65 letters

So, Elise has written a total of 65 + 52 = 117 letters.

"To find the number of families notified in the fourth round, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. 

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 
In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so 3 * 3 = 9 families are notified. 
In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so 9 * 3 = 27 families are notified. 
In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so 27 * 3 = 81 families are notified.

"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first determine the total number of toys in the larger play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys and the larger set is five times larger, we multiply 80 by 5.

80 * 5 = 400

Now, we know that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have 400 toys. Let's call the number of toys Jonathan currently has ""x"". We can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 400

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys. 

The final answer is: 398"

"To find out how many cups Juan needs to reduce, we first need to determine how many cups he currently drinks. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, and Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, we need to know the daily recommended amount of coffee.

Let's assume the daily recommended amount of coffee is x cups. Then, Octavia drinks x/2 cups, and Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

We are given that the daily recommended amount is 4 cups. So, x = 4.

Now, we can find out how many cups Juan currently drinks: 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups.

To find out how many cups Juan needs to reduce, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake: 20 - 4 = 16 cups.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week and then convert that to pages. 

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we need to find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which is 105 / 1.5 = 70.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, she can read 2 * 70 = 140 pages in 105 minutes.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

So, in two weeks, Judy read 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we first need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week. 

The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. 

Total roses ordered per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered per month. 

Total roses ordered per month = 65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Ford grows 40 roses every week. To find out how many roses he grows per month, we multiply the number of roses he grows per week by 4.

Total roses grown per month = 40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

Now, we subtract the total number of roses grown per month from the total number of roses ordered per month to find out how many roses Ford lacks.

Roses lacked per month = Total roses ordered per month - Total roses grown per month

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. So, the cost of bread for 1 sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30. 

The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00. So, the cost of cheese and condiments for 1 sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00.

The total cost for 1 sandwich is $0.30 (bread) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $3.30.

The revenue from selling 1 sandwich is $7.00.

The net profit for 1 sandwich is $7.00 (revenue) - $3.30 (cost) = $3.70.

"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to find the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference is 468 - 450 = 18.
The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4%, to find the actual temperature, we need to add 4% of the set temperature to the set temperature.

The set temperature is 520.
4% of 520 is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.

The actual temperature is 520 + 20.8 = 540.8.

Since the oven is off by the same percentage, to find the temperature Maggie should set it at, we need to subtract 4% of the actual temperature from the actual temperature.

4% of 540.8 is (4/100) * 540.8 = 21.632.

The temperature Maggie should set it at is 540.8 - 21.632 = 519.168.

"To find the total number of contacts, we multiply the number of contacts per box by the number of boxes: 90 contacts/box * 2 boxes = 180 contacts.

Since the contacts last 45 days, we can find the number of contacts per day by dividing the total number of contacts by the number of days: 180 contacts / 45 days = 4 contacts/day.

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, he will have 2 boxes * 90 contacts/box = 180 contacts.

The original price of 2 boxes is 2 * $100.00 = $200.00. With a 10% discount, the discount amount is $200.00 * 0.10 = $20.00. The discounted price is $200.00 - $20.00 = $180.00.

To find the cost per contact, we divide the discounted price by the total number of contacts: $180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact.

Since there are 2 contacts in a pair, the cost per pair is $1.00 * 2 = $2.00.

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. 

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans)
2. G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans)
3. B + R + G = 4500 (total number of jelly beans)

Substituting the first two equations into the third equation, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3.00B = 4500
Divide both sides by 3:
B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

To find the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM. 
After the first increase, his speed is 52 WPM. 
He increases his speed by 5 WPM again, so the third measurement will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we have the three measurements: 47, 52, and 57. 

To find the average, we add the measurements and divide by 3: 
(47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"To find the difference in weight, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then subtract the weight gained from the weight lost.

Weight lost per week: -1.25 pounds
Weight gained per week: 1.75 pounds

For 5 weeks, the total weight change for each option is:
Weight lost: -1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = -6.25 pounds
Weight gained: 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks is the difference between the weight gained and the weight lost:
Difference = Weight gained - Weight lost = 8.75 pounds - (-6.25 pounds) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds

"To find the total number of people attending, we need to calculate the number of people invited via email, the number of friends Alex's friends will bring, and the number of Alex's friends and their spouses.

First, let's calculate the number of people invited via email. Each of the 100 people invited will bring 2 friends, so the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

Next, Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them will bring their spouses, so the total number of Alex's friends and their spouses is 10 + 8 = 18.

Now, we add the number of people invited via email and the number of Alex's friends and their spouses to get the total number of people attending. 

Total number of people = 300 + 18 = 318

However, we also need to include Alex herself, so the total number of people is 318 + 1 = 319.

The final answer is: 319"
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to find the weight of the Papillon first, then multiply it by 44.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. 

The cost of the boots on eBay is $13. 
The shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

So, the total cost of the boots on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

The total cost of the boots on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet, given that it starts at 4 feet and doubles in height every day.

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, so we can write the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown, and then subtract the deposit he has already paid.

The base price of each implant is $2000. Since he needs 2 implants, the total base price is 2 * $2000 = $4000.

He wants a crown for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

He has already paid a deposit of $600. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since he makes $15 per hour at work, to find out how many hours he needs to work to pay for the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, it is 3x.

The sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. 
One angle is 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees.
The other angle is 3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

8 quarters = 8 * 25 cents = 200 cents
6 dimes = 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents
14 nickels = 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents

Total amount of money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / cost of one gumball
= 345 cents / 5 cents

"To find the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds and add it to 8 pounds.

50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds.

Adding 4 pounds to 8 pounds gives us 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

Since Jamaal then uses a weight two pounds lighter than 12 pounds, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he gets each year and add them up.

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games from his parents and 12 games from saving money (1 game per month) and 5 games for Christmas. So, the total number of games in the first year is 5 + 12 + 5 = 22.

In the second year, Steve gets 12 games from saving money (2 games per month) and 5 games for Christmas. So, the total number of games in the second year is 12 * 2 + 5 = 29.

In the third year, Steve gets 12 games from saving money (4 games per month) and 5 games for Christmas. So, the total number of games in the third year is 12 * 4 + 5 = 53.

Now, we add up the total number of games from each year: 22 + 29 + 53 = 104.

"To find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to first find out how many pounds Ruiz makes in an hour. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how many pounds he makes in an hour, we divide 120 by 2. 
120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour. 
3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, we know that both Ruiz and Marissa make 60 and 45 pounds of chocolates per hour respectively. 

In 12 hours, Ruiz will make 60 * 12 = 720 pounds of chocolates.
In 12 hours, Marissa will make 45 * 12 = 540 pounds of chocolates.

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260.

"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the total number of cups sold and the total amount earned from each time period, then add them together.

For the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
Total cups sold in 4 hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups
Total amount earned in 4 hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

For the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
Total cups sold in 2 hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups
Total amount earned in 2 hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

Total amount earned in 6 hours = Total amount earned in 4 hours + Total amount earned in 2 hours
Total amount earned in 6 hours = $30 + $12

"To find out how many times the tires rotate in a month, we need to multiply the number of miles driven per month by the number of rotations per mile. 

Rotations per month = 400 miles/month * 725 rotations/mile = 290,000 rotations/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we need to multiply the rotations per month by 12 to get the total rotations per year.

Rotations per year = 290,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 3,480,000 rotations/year

Now, we need to divide the total number of rotations a tire can undergo by the number of rotations per year to find out how many years the tire will last.

Years before replacement = 10,440,000 rotations / 3,480,000 rotations/year = 3 years

"To find out how much Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3). The discount amount is $60 * 0.3 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost of the items. $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to calculate it separately. We can subtract the final cost from the initial amount of money Joe has. $50 - $42 = $8.

"To find the total number of pounds of butter needed, we need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make and then multiply it by the amount of butter needed per dozen croissants.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week, which is 7 days. So, the total number of croissants he wants to make is:
4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Since 1 dozen is 12, the total number of croissants is:
28 dozen * 12 = 336 croissants

It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed, we multiply the total number of croissants by the amount of butter per dozen:
336 croissants * (1/4 pound/croissant) = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, and there are 100 riders, we can calculate this as 25% of 100, which is 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders.

Next, we need to find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we can calculate this as 60% of 25, which is 0.6 * 25 = 15 women.

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright: 25 - 15 = 10 men.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to find the price of the gold and silver jewels first.

Given that the price of a diamond Jewell is $2000, and the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond Jewell, we can calculate the price of the gold Jewell as follows:

Price of gold Jewell = (4/5) * Price of diamond Jewell
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold, so we can calculate the price of the silver Jewell as follows:

Price of silver Jewell = Price of gold Jewell - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond Jewell + Price of gold Jewell + Price of silver Jewell
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
- He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.
- He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps together: 
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the time it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to determine the relative speed between them. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since speed cannot be negative, we need to take the absolute value of the relative speed.

Relative speed = | -15 mph | = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

The distance Tom needs to cover to catch up with Bob is the initial distance between them, which is 75 miles.

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to first determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, Darren caught 17 - 6 = 11 fish.

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Total cost of classes = $60
Number of classes = 10

Cost per class = Total cost of classes / Number of classes
Cost per class = $60 / 10
Cost per class = $6

Since Manny's parents will not sign him up again if the classes cost more than $10 per class, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can attend at $6 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's say Manny attends x classes at $6 per class and y classes at $10 per class. The total cost of classes should be $60.

6x + 10y = 60

Since Manny can't attend a fraction of a class, we need to find the maximum whole number of classes he can attend at $6 per class.

We can try different values of x to find the maximum number of classes he can attend at $6 per class.

x = 8
6(8) + 10y = 60
48 + 10y = 60
10y = 12
y = 1.2 (not a whole number)

x = 7
6(7) + 10y = 60
42 + 10y = 60
10y = 18
y = 1.8 (not a whole number)

x = 6
6(6) + 10y = 60
36 + 10y = 60
10y = 24
y = 2.4 (not a whole number)

x = 5
6(5) + 10y = 60
30 + 10y = 60
10y = 30
y = 3 (whole number)

So, Manny can attend 5 classes at $6 per class and 5 classes at $10 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again is 5."
"Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and she works all 7 days of the week, her total weekly production is 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, she processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day. Working all 7 days of the week, her total weekly production is 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for the two is 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to first determine how many miles Reggie ran. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, and Paisley ran 4 miles. So, Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. This means Reggie's total miles minus 3 is equal to Lynn's miles. So, Lynn's miles = Reggie's miles - 3 = 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

Cost of 5 apples = $1.30 * 5 = $6.50

To find the cost of 5 oranges, we need to first find the cost of one orange.

Cost of 3 oranges = $3.30
Cost of 1 orange = $3.30 / 3 = $1.10

Now, we can find the cost of 5 oranges.
Cost of 5 oranges = $1.10 * 5 = $5.50

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges.
Total cost = Cost of 5 apples + Cost of 5 oranges
Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50
Total cost = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the features and the base price:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

"To find the total amount Tim will make in a year, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his monthly salary:
5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Next, let's calculate the bonus:
Bonus = half a month's salary = $20,000 / 2 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly income:
Total monthly income = new monthly salary + bonus = $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as 4S + 2G = 70.

Since each sheep has 1 head and each goose has 1 head, the total number of heads can be represented as S + G = 20.

We can solve the second equation for G: G = 20 - S.

Substituting G = 20 - S into the first equation, we get 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

"To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we need to find the difference between the target height and the current height:

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. 
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs 8 more toys.
   Total toys needed so far: 4 (initial toys) + 8 (additional toys) = 12 toys
3. When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs.
   Total dogs now: 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (initial additional dogs) + 16 (new dogs) = 28 dogs
   Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 28 more toys.
   Total toys needed so far: 12 (previous toys) + 28 (new toys) = 40 toys
4. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys.
   Total toys needed: 40 (previous toys) - 3 (unnecessary toys) = 37 toys

"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we first need to determine how many signatures they currently have. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 

Total signatures currently collected = 20 (Carol) + 44 (Jennifer) = 64 signatures

The sisters want to reach a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the current total from their goal.

Signatures needed = 100 (goal) - 64 (current total) = 36 signatures

The sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to find out how much she earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Karen works in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, in two days she works 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can find out how much Karen earns in two days by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works: $20 * 6 = $120.

"To find the total number of cookies, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has. 

Katarina has 68 cookies. 
Max has 5 more cookies than Katarina, so Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.
The Cookie Monster has 12 less cookies than Max, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.
Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we add up the number of cookies each person has: 
68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = 298

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to subtract the added length from the final length and then divide by 1.5 (since 50% increase is the same as multiplying by 1.5).

Let's denote the original length as x.

The final length is the original length plus 50% of the original length, which is 1.5x, plus 20cm.

We know that the final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

The original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took for each mode and then add them together.

Time in turtle mode: 1 hour = 60 minutes
Time in rabbit mode: 40 minutes

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to multiply the time for each mode by 0.5 (half).

Time in turtle mode: 60 minutes * 0.5 = 30 minutes
Time in rabbit mode: 40 minutes * 0.5 = 20 minutes

Now, we add the time for both modes to get the total time.

Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. 

Since there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, we have two equations based on the given information:

1. T + (T+7) + t = 44 (combined ages)
2. T = t (since the twin and triplet are the same age)

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
T + (T+7) + T = 44
Combine like terms:
3T + 7 = 44
Subtract 7 from both sides:
3T = 37
Divide both sides by 3:
T = 12.33

However, since age cannot be a fraction, we need to re-examine the problem. The problem statement implies that the ages are whole numbers. Let's re-examine the problem with the assumption that the triplet is the youngest.

Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. 

Since there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, we have two equations based on the given information:

1. T + (T+7) + t = 44 (combined ages)
2. T = t + 7 (since the twin is 7 years older than the triplet)

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
T + (T+7) + (T-7) = 44
Combine like terms:
2T = 44
Divide both sides by 2:
T = 22

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

The total cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. 
The total cost of 4 candies is $3.20. 
So, the cost of one candy is $3.20 / 4 = $0.80.

Now, we can find the total cost of 10 lollipops: 10 * $0.40 = $4.00.
The total cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.80 = $8.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00.

"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year) and 10 (the number of years).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 coins more than Rong. 
So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year: 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year: 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings: 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings: 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, but we don't know the total bill yet. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

"To find the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends, we first need to find the total number of slices they ate. Since there are 5 people in total (Bryce and 4 friends), and 2/3 of their pizzas were eaten, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by these 5 people as follows:

5 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 5 * 8 = 40 slices

However, this is the total number of slices eaten by 5 people, but we know that 2 of these people ate 2/3 of their pizzas, and 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas. So, we need to find the total number of slices eaten by 3 people who ate 2/3 of their pizzas. 

3 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 3 * 8 = 24 slices

Now, we need to find the total number of slices eaten by the 2 remaining friends who ate ¾ of their pizzas. 

2 people * 3/4 * 12 slices/person = 2 * 9 = 18 slices

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by all 5 people by adding the slices eaten by the 3 people who ate 2/3 of their pizzas and the 2 people who ate ¾ of their pizzas.

Total slices eaten = 24 + 18 = 42 slices

Since there were 5 people and each pizza had 12 slices, the total number of slices was 5 * 12 = 60 slices.

Now, we can find the number of slices left by subtracting the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices.

Slices left = 60 - 42 = 18 slices

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so 8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding 4 inches to that gives us 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches, and it is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes 'x'. We can write the equation as:

100 = 9x + 10

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us:

90 = 9x

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us:

x = 10

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

1. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
   90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons.

2. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
   50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

3. She trades the rest of her large stickers (40 - 20 = 20) for small buttons. 
   Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has:

Total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that 2/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and we found that there are 18 Pomeranians. To find the total number of puppies, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total Puppies = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much Jayden needs to buy the camera, we first need to calculate how much money he has after receiving the allowance from his sister. 

Jayden initially had $70. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. 

So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as x. Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second, the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first, so it needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. We can write an equation to represent this:

x + (x/2) + x = 250

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms:

5x = 500

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

Now that we know the second house needs 100 cases of shingles, we can find the number of cases the third house needs, which is x = 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each person's purchase and add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so her total is 3 * $2 = $6.
Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so his total is 5 * $1 = $5.
Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3, so his total is $3.

Now, let's add their totals together: $6 + $5 + $3 = $14.

"To find the number of pears George has, we need to calculate 45% of 200 bananas and add it to the number of bananas.

45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas. Since he has 200 bananas, he has 200 + 90 = 290 pears.

The total number of fruits George has is the sum of bananas and pears: 200 (bananas) + 290 (pears) = 490.

The final answer is: 490"
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the money she had and then divide the result by the cost of each candy bar.

Marissa had $80 and spent $20 on the ball, so she had $80 - $20 = $60 left.

The candy bars cost $5 each, so we divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar: $60 / $5 = 12.

"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then add them together.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for the hours worked is 5 * $15 = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Monday is $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her total earnings for the hours worked is 2 * $15 = $30. Since she teaches less than or equal to 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Wednesday is $30.

Now, we add the total earnings for both days: $80 + $30 = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents and there are 4 vanilla scents available, so they sold a total of 5 * 4 = 20 vanilla scents.

The company sold 2 fruity scents and there are 8 fruity scents available, so they sold a total of 2 * 8 = 16 fruity scents.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold. 

Difference = Number of vanilla scents sold - Number of fruity scents sold
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we first need to calculate how much money he makes from selling the eggplants. 

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount he makes from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he already makes $60 from eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

He has 25 ears of corn, so to find out how much he should sell each ear for, we divide the total amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25). 

$75 / 25 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total time spent on soccer, we first need to find the remaining time after reading and video games. 

Total weekend time: 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading: 3 hours
Remaining time: 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Time spent playing video games: 1/3 of the remaining time = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours
Remaining time after video games: 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

Time spent playing soccer: 6 hours

To find the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100.

"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps:

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils and gave 1/2 of them to Brandon. 
   1/2 of 50 is 50 * 1/2 = 25 pencils given to Brandon.
   So, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

2. Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie.
   3/5 of 25 is 25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils given to Charlie.
   So, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

Time to drive to the museum: 
Distance to the museum = 150 miles
Speed = 75 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 150 / 75 = 2 hours

Time to drive back home:
Distance to the museum = 150 miles
Speed = 75 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 150 / 75 = 2 hours

Total time driving = Time to drive to the museum + Time to drive back home = 2 + 2 = 4 hours

Total time Jack is gone from home = Total time driving + Time at the museum = 4 + 6 = 10 hours

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the series movies, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies.

First, let's find the number of series movies. A third of the movies are in series, so the number of series movies is 600 / 3 = 200.

The cost of the series movies is 200 * $6 = $1200.

Next, let's find the number of remaining movies. The number of remaining movies is 600 - 200 = 400.

40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so the number of older movies is 400 * 0.4 = 160.

The cost of the older movies is 160 * $5 = $800.

The number of normal movies is 400 - 160 = 240.

The cost of the normal movies is 240 * $10 = $2400.

"To find the distance, we first need to find the speed at which they hiked. 

The Llesis family drove at an average of 50 miles per hour. Half of their speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. They hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their speed, so their hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

They hiked for 1.5 hours, so the distance they hiked is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

They drove for 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours. The distance they drove is 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

The total distance to their vacation spot is 30 + 225 = 255 miles.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma.

Let's assume Emma's score is x. 

Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's enemy score is x + 8 * 10 = x + 80.
Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, Ava's berry score is x + 3 * 5 = x + 15.
Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, Ava's timer score is (60 - 4) - (60 - x) * 30 = -240 + 30x.

The total score for Emma is x.
The total score for Ava is (x + 80) + (x + 15) + (-240 + 30x) = 31x - 145.

The difference between their scores is (31x - 145) - x = 30x - 145.

To find the difference, we need to know the value of x. However, the problem doesn't provide a specific value for x. Since we are asked to provide a numerical answer, we will assume that the problem is asking for the difference in terms of the difference in the number of enemies jumped on and berries collected, which is 8 * 10 + 3 * 5 = 83.

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to find the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. 

Two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, so the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract this amount from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. 

Total cost of all pizzas = 64 dollars
Cost of two known pizzas = 60 dollars
Cost of the other two pizzas = Total cost of all pizzas - Cost of two known pizzas
Cost of the other two pizzas = 64 - 60
Cost of the other two pizzas = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

Cost of each pizza = Cost of the other two pizzas / 2
Cost of each pizza = 4 / 2
Cost of each pizza = 2 dollars

"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on usual days and the extra days to get the total number of times they ride in a week: 15 + 12 = 27.

"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'w' and the number of orange fish Bob bought as 'o'. 

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying 'w' white fish and 'o' orange fish, he had 3 + o white fish and 4 + w orange fish. 

Since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation: 4 + w = 2(3 + o).

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so w + o = 17.

We can solve the second equation for o: o = 17 - w.

Substituting this into the first equation, we get: 4 + w = 2(3 + (17 - w)).

Expanding the equation, we get: 4 + w = 6 + 34 - 2w.

Combine like terms: 4 + w = 40 - 2w.

Add 2w to both sides: 3w + 4 = 40.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3w = 36.

Divide both sides by 3: w = 12.

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total miles driven per week and then multiply it by the fuel efficiency and the price of gas.

The one-way distance between home and office is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 5 * 2 = 10 miles per day. Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, the total miles driven per week is 10 * 5 = 50 miles.

The fuel efficiency of Andy's car is 10 MPG, so the amount of gas consumed per week is 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons.

The price of gas is $3 per gallon, so the total cost per week is 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15.

"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the amount she spent from the quarters and the twenties separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent from the quarters. Since she had 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount she spent from the quarters is:

140 quarters * $0.25 = $35

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent from the twenties. She had 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. 3/5 of 10 is 6, so she spent 6 twenties. Each twenty is worth $20, so the total amount she spent from the twenties is:

6 twenties * $20 = $120

Now, let's add the amount she spent from the quarters and the twenties to find the total amount she paid for lunch:

$35 (quarters) + $120 (twenties) = $155

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature at night. 

Given that it was 45 degrees during the day and it's 33 degrees colder at night, we can calculate the temperature at night as follows:
Temperature at night = Temperature during the day - 33 degrees
Temperature at night = 45 - 33
Temperature at night = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house to at least 32 degrees. 

To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we can calculate the difference between the temperature at night and the temperature at which the pipes will freeze:
Difference = Temperature at night - Temperature at which pipes will freeze
Difference = 12 - 32
Difference = -20

However, since we can't burn a negative number of logs, we need to find the difference between the temperature at which the pipes will freeze and the temperature at night, and then divide it by the amount of heat each log produces:
Difference = Temperature at which pipes will freeze - Temperature at night
Difference = 32 - 12
Difference = 20

Number of logs needed = Difference / Heat per log
Number of logs needed = 20 / 5
Number of logs needed = 4

First, we find the number of groups: 
Number of people = 90
Number of people per group = 9
Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Next, we find the number of groups that brought seashells: 
Fraction of groups that brought seashells = 3/5
Number of groups that brought seashells = Number of groups * Fraction of groups that brought seashells
Number of groups that brought seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought seashells = 6

Now, we find the total number of seashells: 
Number of seashells per group = 2
Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total number of seashells = 6 * 2
Total number of seashells = 12

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find the number of stuffed goats that Bubbles should buy to make the percentage of stuffed goats 30% of all her stuffed animals. Let's represent the number of stuffed goats as 'x'. The total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats will be 14 + x.

The percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals, so we can set up the equation:

( x / (14 + x) ) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get rid of the fraction:

x * 100 = 30 * (14 + x)

Now, we can expand the right side of the equation:

100x = 420 + 30x

Next, we can subtract 30x from both sides to get:

70x = 420

Now, we can divide both sides by 70 to solve for x:

x = 420 / 70
x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats to make the percentage of stuffed goats 30% of all her stuffed animals.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in 2 weeks and 1 week.

In 2 weeks, there are 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in 2 weeks.

In 1 week, there are 7 days. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in 1 week.

Total hours Kris has played = 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

Since Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement, she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between the two distances.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 70 miles/hour x 2 hours = 140 miles

The difference in distance between the two cars is:
Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the diamond and the gold, then add the 30% premium.

Cost of diamond: $600
Cost of gold: $300
Total cost of diamond and gold: $600 + $300 = $900

The premium is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold, which is 0.3 * $900 = $270.

Total cost with premium: $900 + $270 = $1170

The final answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340, and the total number of third-graders is 500. 
The number of fourth-graders who passed is 40, and the total number of fourth-graders is 100.

The pass rate for the fifth graders is twice the pass rate of the fourth graders. Since 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed, the pass rate for the fourth graders is 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%. 
The pass rate for the fifth graders is 2 * 0.4 = 0.8 or 80%. 
The number of fifth-graders who passed is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 320 (fifth-graders) = 700.

The total number of students in the school is 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students: 700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to find out how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch, and each bag has 72 chips, we need to find out how many chips Milo has in total. 

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, so he has 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Since it takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch, we can divide the total number of chips by 12 to find out how many square inches Milo can make. 

144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, and he can make 12 square inches, we need to find out how long the mosaic will be. 

To do this, we can divide the total square inches by the height of the mosaic. 

12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of tea left, we need to calculate the total amount of tea drank by the students. 

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea drank by all students is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. 

So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party in gallons is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

Dale initially ordered 100 candies and then ordered 100 more. So, the total number of candies he has is 100 + 100 = 200.

He has already sold 150 candies. To find out how many he still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies: 200 - 150 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the number of students at the end of May, we need to calculate the number of times the initial number of students doubles from January to May.

January: 10 students
February: 10 * 2 = 20 students
March: 20 * 2 = 40 students
April: 40 * 2 = 80 students
May: 80 * 2 = 160 students

The number of students at the end of May is 160. To find the number of additional students, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May.

Additional students = 160 - 10 = 150

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25).

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (5 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:
- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used and the ones dropped from the total number of marshmallows in the bag.

Total marshmallows in the bag = 35
Marshmallows used by John = 9
Marshmallows used by DeSean = 9
Total marshmallows used = 9 + 9 = 18
Marshmallows dropped = 3
Total marshmallows used and dropped = 18 + 3 = 21

Now, subtract the total marshmallows used and dropped from the total in the bag:
Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14

Since there are 14 marshmallows left, and there are 2 kids, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many each kid can have:
14 / 2 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the total time played by each person and then multiply it by the cost per minute. 

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. 
Two of his friends can play for half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. 
One of his friends can play for 1.5 times as long, so they can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter.

The total time played is 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Jack's time: 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters
Two friends' time: 240 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters * 2 = 48 quarters
Better friend's time: 240 minutes / 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters

Total quarters used = 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 * 0.25 = $17.

The final answer is: $17"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces.
- The amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance.
- The amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar.
- The amount of oil is twice as much as the amount of salt.
- The amount of salt is twice as much as the amount of citrus zest.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x. 
Since the amount of salt is twice as much as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of salt is 2x.
Since the amount of oil is twice as much as the amount of salt, the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total amount of the mixture is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: x (citrus zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces.

Combine like terms: 8x = 10.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 10 / 8 = 1.25.

Since the amount of oil is 4x, the amount of oil is 4 * 1.25 = 5 ounces.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

Cost of goats: 3 goats * $500 each = 3 * 500 = $1500
Cost of cows: 2 cows * $1500 each = 2 * 1500 = $3000

Total cost: $1500 (goats) + $3000 (cows) = $4500

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed: 63
Cupcakes already have: 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Now, subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs:
63 - 48 = 15

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

15"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cars Joe has initially, then calculate the number of cars he sells and gives away, and finally find out how many cars he has left.

Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

He gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, which is 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

So, Joe gives away a total of 8 (sold) + 16 (given away) = 24 cars.

To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the number of cars he sold and gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine how much money the students raised in total. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the students raised $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we know that there are 20 students and they each raised the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the number of students: $125,000 / 20 = $6,250.

The final answer is: $6,250"

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 
On the second day, she walked half as many hours as the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes
4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

Now, we add the time from both days:
480 minutes + 240 minutes = 720 minutes

"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first find the total number of cars in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break.

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When he got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 of the cars had gone. This means 1/2 of 70 had left, so 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars had left.

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35.

However, the question asks for the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break. This would be the number of cars that were present when he got out of class for the lunch break, which is 35.

"To find out how much John makes in a day, we need to multiply the number of cycles he does in a day by the number of tasks in each cycle and the pay per task. 

Number of cycles per day: 30
Number of tasks per cycle: 5
Pay per task: $1.20

Daily earnings = Number of cycles per day * Number of tasks per cycle * Pay per task
Daily earnings = 30 * 5 * $1.20
Daily earnings = 180 * $1.20
Daily earnings = $216

To find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7.

Weekly earnings = Daily earnings * 7
Weekly earnings = $216 * 7
Weekly earnings = $1512

"To find the total points Sasha scored, we need to calculate her points in both games. 

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 
In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. 
So, in the second game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.

The total points Sasha scored during both games is 14 + 4 = 18."

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. So, we can write the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, Smendrick has 3x cards, and Becca has 3x + 12 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs.

She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had (1/3) * 9 = 3 yellow eggs.

To find the total number of eggs, we add the number of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars.
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we subtract the production of the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production of the fourth week:

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. Angela has additional items to be installed: 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. 

First, let's calculate the number of additional items: 
- Mirrors: 6 (additional) + 4 (initial) = 10
- Chandeliers: 2 (additional) + 1 (initial) = 3
- Pictures: 20 (additional) + 10 (initial) = 30

Now, let's calculate the cost of the additional items:
- Mirrors: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00
- Chandeliers: 3 * $15.00 = $45.00
- Pictures: 30 * $15.00 = $450.00

The total cost of the additional items is $150.00 + $45.00 + $450.00 = $645.00

Now, let's add the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items:

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first determine how much money Anthony has. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $20.00 + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $30.00

Now that we know Anthony's savings, we can calculate Roy's savings. Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we can calculate Roy's savings as follows:

Let's first find 40% of Anthony's savings:
40% of $30.00 = 0.4 * $30.00 = $12.00

Now, we add this amount to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings:
Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% of Anthony's savings
Roy's savings = $30.00 + $12.00
Roy's savings = $42.00

So, Roy has saved $42.00.

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to find out how high Saskay, Kagiyami, and Naruto can lift a mountain in relation to Pompei.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches.
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can divide the total time by the number of kangaroos to find the time it takes for one kangaroo.

Time for one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Time for one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3
Time for one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, it will take them twice as long to travel the same distance. 

Time for one turtle = 2 * Time for one kangaroo
Time for one turtle = 2 * 6 hours
Time for one turtle = 12 hours

Since there are four turtles, we can multiply the time it takes for one turtle by 4 to find the total time it takes for all four turtles.

Total time for four turtles = Time for one turtle * Number of turtles
Total time for four turtles = 12 hours * 4
Total time for four turtles = 48 hours

"Let's break down the information given:

- The original price of the laptop is $600.
- The price is reduced by $200 when trading in the old laptop, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
- Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
- Her mom gives her $80 to help.
- Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.

To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to add the money she has from her job and the money her mom gave her, and then subtract the amount she still needs from the reduced price of the laptop.

First, let's add the money Erika has from her job and her mom: $150 + $80 = $230.

Now, let's subtract the amount she still needs from the reduced price of the laptop: $400 - $50 = $350.

Since Erika has $350 and she has $230 from her job and her mom, we can find out how much she had in her purse by subtracting $230 from $350: $350 - $230 = $120.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the used length of each glue stick and subtract it from the original length.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the used length is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6 of the original length. 
5/6 * 12 = 10 millimeters used, so the unused length is 12 - 10 = 2 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the used length is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 of the original length. 
1/3 * 12 = 4 millimeters used, so the unused length is 12 - 4 = 8 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the used length is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2 of the original length. 
1/2 * 12 = 6 millimeters used, so the unused length is 12 - 6 = 6 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy and subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the items is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10080.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and $200 from his brother, so he has a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

Now, let's subtract the amount of money Gabriel has from the total cost of the items: $10080 - $5200 = $4880.

So, Gabriel still needs $4880."

"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount.

Craig has 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is 2 x $20 = $40.

He buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of squirt guns is 6 x $2 = $12.

He buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of water balloons is 3 x $3 = $9.

The total amount he spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

The final answer is: $19"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, but we don't know the number of socks Jack has yet.
3. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, which means Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.
4. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Now, we know Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes. Peter has 30 dishes and an unknown number of socks. Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.

The total number of socks is 30 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Peter's socks) = 90 socks.
The total number of dishes is 60 (Jack's dishes) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 90 dishes.

The total number of socks and dishes together is 90 + 90 = 180."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total students: 20
- Students good at math only: 5
- Students good at English only: 8
- Students good at both math and English: unknown (let's call this x)

Since the total number of students is the sum of students good at math only, students good at English only, and students good at both, we can set up the equation:

5 (math only) + 8 (English only) + x (both) = 20 (total)

Combine the constants:
13 + x = 20

Subtract 13 from both sides:
x = 7

This means 7 students are good at both math and English. To find the total number of students good at math, we need to add the students good at math only and those good at both:

5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12

So, the total number of students good at math is 12.

"To find the total time available for performances, we need to subtract the intermission time from the total concert time. 

Total concert time = 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
Intermission time = 10 minutes
Time available for performances = Total concert time - Intermission time = 120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Each group takes 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes to perform and exit. 
Number of groups that can perform = Time available for performances / Time per group = 110 / 10 = 11

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 0.75 * $300 = $225 per year.

After 1 year, Brenda will have: $300 (initial) + $225 (interest) = $525
After 2 years, Brenda will have: $525 (previous total) + $225 (interest) = $750
After 3 years, Brenda will have: $750 (previous total) + $225 (interest) = $975

The number of white shirts with no collars is 40 - 20 = 20.

To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we need to find the number of floral shirts with buttons and subtract it from the total number of floral shirts. 20 of the floral shirts have buttons. 

The number of floral shirts with no buttons is 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.

90 / 2 = 45 rooms

Now, we need to find the total time it takes to clean 45 rooms. It takes 20 minutes to clean each room, so we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

"Let's denote my age as 'x'. Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age is 'x + 3'. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is 'x - 2'. 

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, which is 3(x + 3) - 1.

To find out how many oranges she remained with, we subtract the total number of oranges given away from the initial number of oranges: 
12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each person is:
- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold. 

She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, she baked 2 * 5 = 10 loaves. 

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she baked 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, and she sold all 80 slices. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to find the number of silver coins first. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and Gretchen has 70 gold coins, we can set up an equation to find the number of silver coins:

Let x be the number of silver coins.
Then, x + 30 = 70 (since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins)

To solve for x, we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:
x = 70 - 30
x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

Now, to find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins:
Total coins = 70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins)
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to calculate the total number of burritos eaten by the students and Mr. George, and then subtract that from the total number of burritos ordered.

First, let's calculate the total number of burritos eaten by the students:
50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos

Then, add the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George:
500 burritos + 20 burritos = 520 burritos

Now, subtract the total number of burritos eaten from the total number of burritos ordered:
600 burritos - 520 burritos = 80 burritos

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first find the number of green, blue, and red cars.

The rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than they have red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so they have 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.

The total number of red, green, and blue cars is 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 cars.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We know that S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
We also know that A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get S = (F - 12) + 25
S = F + 13

We also know that S + A + F = 85 (Together, they have 85 books)

Substituting the first equation into this, we get (F + 13) + A + F = 85
Combine like terms: 2F + A + 13 = 85

Substituting the second equation into this, we get 2F + (F - 12) + 13 = 85
Combine like terms: 3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides: 3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3: F = 28

The final answer is: 28"
"To find the weight of the carrots, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weigh 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The weight of the carrots is 7 pounds."

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to find out how much Keenan spends in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays 40% of the cost. 

40% of $400 is 0.4 x 400 = $160. 

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we need to divide the amount Keenan spends in a month by 4 to find out how much he spends per week. 

$160 / 4 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many pieces Tobias ate, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them together.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. First, we need to find out how many pieces were left after the first two days. 
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces left.

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26.
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up the total number of pieces he ate:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to first find out her rate of earning per hour. 

Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of dog walking. 

Rate per hour = Total earnings / Total hours
Rate per hour = $33 / 3 hours
Rate per hour = $11 per hour

Now, we can multiply the rate per hour by the total hours she will work to find her total earnings.

Total earnings = Rate per hour * Total hours
Total earnings = $11 per hour * 12 hours
Total earnings = $132

"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the steps:

1. Paul starts with 52 marbles.
2. He receives 28 more marbles from his friend, so now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.
3. He loses 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 80 by 4. 80 / 4 = 20.
4. So, Paul loses 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract 20 from 80: 80 - 20 = 60.

"To find out how much money Isaias made from selling the chickens, we first need to find out how many chickens he sold. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens, we can calculate this as follows:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Now, we know that he sold 180 chickens at $50 per chicken. To find the total amount of money he made, we multiply the number of chickens sold by the price per chicken:

180 * $50 = $9000

However, the question asks for the cost of the chickens he took to the market for sale, not the profit. To find the cost, we need to know that the profit is the selling price minus the cost. Since we know the profit is $2000 and the selling price is $9000, we can set up the equation:

Selling price - Cost = Profit
$9000 - Cost = $2000

Now, we can solve for the cost:

Cost = $9000 - $2000
Cost = $7000

The final answer is: $7000"
"Since Julie and the boys sold an equal number of glasses, and there are two boys, Micah and Mitchell, they together sold 32 - 14 = 18 glasses. 

Since they sold an equal number of glasses, each boy sold 18 / 2 = 9 glasses.

To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold: 14 - 9 = 5.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years. This means her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years old.

Let's denote the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age as 'x'. 

In 'x' years, Melanie's age will be her current age plus 'x', which is 8 + x. 

Her age will be thrice her present age in 'x' years, so we can set up the equation: 8 + x = 3 * 8.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 8 + x = 24.

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get: x = 16.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

The cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10.
The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 * 2 * $10 = $120, since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.
The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 * ($4 / 2) = $14, since each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.

The total cost of all the items is $10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156.

Kelly's budget is $65, so she has $65 - $156 = -$91 left in her budget. However, since you cannot have a negative amount of money, this means Kelly has overspent her budget by $91.

The final answer is: $-91"
"Let's denote the runtime of Elaina's usual concert as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, its runtime is 2x. 

The final concert also includes a 15-minute encore, so the total runtime of the final concert is 2x + 15. We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. 

We can set up the equation: 2x + 15 = 65

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 
2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find the value of x:
x = 50 / 2
x = 25

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which is five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

"Let's break down the information given:

- Ellen eats 2 carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day.
- The salad costs $6.
- The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.
- The total cost of Ellen's daily goods is $11.

We know that the total cost is the sum of the cost of 2 carrots, the salad, and the yogurt. Let's represent the cost of one carrot as 'x'. Then, the cost of 2 carrots is 2x.

The total cost equation is: 2x + 6 (salad) + 3 (yogurt) = 11

Combine the constants: 2x + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides: 2x = 2

Divide both sides by 2: x = 1

The cost of one carrot is $1.

"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The total number of times she mowed lawns in the first week is 3x + x = 4x.

In the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, which is 5x times. 

The total number of times she mowed lawns in the second week is 5x.

The total number of times she mowed lawns in two weeks is 4x + 5x = 9x.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and she mowed his lawn x times, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x.

We know that the total amount she made from mowing lawns and lemonade sales is $80. So, we can set up the equation:

6x + (amount from lemonade sales) = 80

We also know that the amount from mowing lawns is 6x, so we can rewrite the equation as:

6x + (amount from lemonade sales) = 80
6x + (80 - 6x) = 80
80 - 6x + 6x = 80
80 = 80

However, this equation doesn't give us any information about the amount from lemonade sales. We need to find the relationship between the number of times she mowed lawns and the amount she made from mowing lawns. We know that she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, which is x times. 

Since we don't know the value of x, we can't find the exact amount she made from mowing lawns. However, we can find the amount she made from lemonade sales by subtracting the amount she made from mowing lawns from the total amount she made.

Let's assume she mowed Joe's lawn x times. Then, the amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x.

We know that the total amount she made is $80, and she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn. So, the amount she made from mowing other lawns is 80 - 6 = 74.

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times, the total number of times she mowed other lawns is 3x + 5x = 8x.

The amount she made from mowing other lawns is 6x * 8x = 48x.

We know that the amount she made from mowing other lawns is 74, so we can set up the equation:

48x = 74

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides by 48:

x = 74 / 48
x = 1.54 (approximately)

However, x must be a whole number since it represents the number of times she mowed a lawn. We can try different values of x to find the one that satisfies the equation.

Let's try x = 1:

48 * 1 = 48 (less than 74)

Let's try x = 2:

48 * 2 = 96 (greater than 74)

Since x must be a whole number, we can try x = 1.54, but we can't mow a fraction of a lawn. However, we can try x = 1 and x = 2, and see which one gives us the correct amount from mowing lawns.

Let's try x = 1:

The amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn is 6 * 1 = 6.

The amount she made from mowing Kamala's lawn is 6 * 3 = 18.

The amount she made from mowing Alba's lawn is 6 * 5 = 30.

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6 + 18 + 30 = 54.

The amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 54 = 26.

Each person eats one bowl, so 6 bowls will be used for dinner. 

The pot has enough soup to fill 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls. Since 6 bowls were used for dinner, we need to find out how many bowls the pot can fill in terms of child's bowls. 

Since 4 adult's bowls = 8 child's bowls, 1 adult's bowl = 2 child's bowls. 

So, 6 adult's bowls = 6 * 2 = 12 child's bowls. 

Now, we know the pot can fill 8 child's bowls. To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we divide the total number of child's bowls by the number of child's bowls the pot can fill. 

12 child's bowls / 8 child's bowls = 1.5 

Since we can't have a fraction of a bowl, we round down to 1.5. However, the question asks for how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, so we round down to 1 time for the first bowl, and the remaining soup will be used for the second bowl. 

So, each child can have 2 bowls of soup for lunch."
"To find the total amount William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks: 
- Each small mask requires 2 yards of material.
- Jo needs to make 20 small masks.
- Total material required for small masks = 20 * 2 = 40 yards.

For large masks: 
- Each large mask requires 2.25 yards of material.
- Jo needs to make 8 large masks.
- Total material required for large masks = 8 * 2.25 = 18 yards.

Total material required = material for small masks + material for large masks = 40 + 18 = 58 yards.

"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total time he spends on activities and subtract that from 24 hours (the total hours in a day).

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. 
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Total time spent on activities = 10 (sleep) + 8 (work) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours.

Free time = 24 (total hours in a day) - 19 (time spent on activities) = 5 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. 
2. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write the equation: (Duncan's age eight years ago) = 2 * (Adam's age four years ago)
   We know Duncan's current age is 60, so his age eight years ago was 60 - 8 = 52.
   Therefore, 52 = 2 * x
3. To find Adam's age four years ago, we need to solve for 'x'. Divide both sides of the equation by 2:
   x = 52 / 2
   x = 26
4. Now that we know Adam's age four years ago, we can find his current age by adding 4 to 'x':
   Adam's current age = x + 4
   Adam's current age = 26 + 4
   Adam's current age = 30
5. To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
   Adam's age in 8 years = Adam's current age + 8
   Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
   Adam's age in 8 years = 38

"To find the total acres of Farmer Smith's farm, we need to calculate twice the acres of Farmer Brown's farm and add 100 to it. 

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 
Twice that is 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 
Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we need to add the acres of both farms together. 
200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes in that time and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

In an 8-hour workday, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, his total earnings for the day would be 320 * $0.20 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku and then divide it by the time it takes to drink one bottle of water.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so an extreme sudoku takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to convert the time from minutes to half hours. 180 minutes is equal to 180 / 30 = 6 half hours.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, he drinks 6 bottles of water in 6 half hours.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
- Total bologna thrown = 58
- Number of red balloons = 20

Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, the total bologna thrown at red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, let's find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at yellow balloons. 
Total bologna thrown at yellow balloons = Total bologna thrown - Total bologna thrown at red balloons
= 58 - 40
= 18

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons is 18 / 3 = 6.

"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days. 

Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so the total miles driven is 100 * 30 = 3000 miles.

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we need to divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs.

3000 miles / 1000 miles per tune-up = 3 tune-ups.

"To find out how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2.

The cost of the cake is $11. 
The cost of 1 dozen balloons is $0.5 for 2 balloons. Since 1 dozen is 12, the number of 2-balloon sets is 12 / 2 = 6. So, the cost of 1 dozen balloons is 6 * $0.5 = $3.
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total cost is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance, the total amount of money they had is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total amount by 2: $28 / 2 = $14.

"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them up.

Larry has 3 cats.

He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add up the number of each type of pet: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

"To find out how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and turned 10 years old, she has been collecting shells for 5 years.

There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply 5 years by 12 months to get the total number of months:

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell every month, we multiply the total number of months by 1 shell/month:

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday."
"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to find the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea. Since Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows with equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea, the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea is 27 / 2 = 13.5. However, since we can't have half a cup, this means that 0.5 cups are left over for the cinnamon tea. 

Since the remaining 0.5 cups are for the cinnamon tea, and Lana brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, we can set up an equation to find the number of cups of mint tea in each row. Let x be the number of cups of mint tea in each row. Then, 3x - 0.5 = 15. 

To solve for x, we add 0.5 to both sides of the equation: 3x = 15.5. Then, we divide both sides by 3: x = 15.5 / 3 = 5.17. 

Since we can't have a fraction of a cup, we can round down to 5 cups of mint tea in each row."

"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and John's age as J. 

We are given that Pp = J + 10. 
We are also given that P = Pp + J. 
We are also given that P + Pp + J = 100.

Substituting Pp = J + 10 into the equation P = Pp + J, we get P = (J + 10) + J, which simplifies to P = 2J + 10.

Substituting P = 2J + 10 and Pp = J + 10 into the equation P + Pp + J = 100, we get (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100.

Simplifying the equation, we get 4J + 20 = 100.

Subtracting 20 from both sides, we get 4J = 80.

Dividing both sides by 4, we get J = 20.

Now that we know J = 20, we can find Pp = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.

The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. James swims the remaining distance at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

The total time it took James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time it took to swim the remaining distance:

Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday and then subtract 40 from that result.

Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had, so we subtract 40 from 490: 490 - 40 = 450.

The final answer is: 450"
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to subtract the stickers she lost from the stickers she initially received, and then add the stickers she got for helping her classmates.

Jasmine initially received 15 stickers.
She lost 7 stickers, so we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8
Then, she got 5 more stickers for helping her classmates, so we add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13

Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

"To find the total commission earned by Cayley, we need to calculate the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal separately and then add them together.

Commission from New York Times: 
- Number of copies sold: 6
- Price per copy: $5
- Commission rate: 10%
- Commission = (Number of copies sold * Price per copy * Commission rate) / 100
- Commission = (6 * 5 * 10) / 100
- Commission = 300 / 100
- Commission = $3

Commission from Wall Street Journal: 
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Price per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%
- Commission = (Number of copies sold * Price per copy * Commission rate) / 100
- Commission = (10 * 15 * 8) / 100
- Commission = 1200 / 100
- Commission = $12

Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
- Total commission = $3 + $12
- Total commission = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Deanna is 26 years old.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.
3. Marcus is half of Leo's age, so Leo's age is twice Marcus's age. 

To find Leo's age, we multiply Marcus's age by 2: 21 * 2 = 42.

"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D. 

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. 

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can set A + 20 = D + 10. 

We also know that B + A + D = 45. 

We can substitute B = A + 20 into the equation B + A + D = 45, which gives us (A + 20) + A + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2A + D + 20 = 45. 

We can also substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B + A + D = 45, which gives us (D + 10) + A + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2D + A + 10 = 45. 

Now we have two equations: 2A + D + 20 = 45 and 2D + A + 10 = 45. 

We can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate A: (2A + D + 20) - (2D + A + 10) = 45 - 45. 

This simplifies to A - D + 10 = 0. 

We can rearrange the equation to get A - D = -10. 

Now we can add D to both sides to get A = D - 10. 

We can substitute A = D - 10 into the equation B = A + 20, which gives us B = (D - 10) + 20. 

This simplifies to B = D + 10. 

We know that B = D + 10 and B = A + 20. 

We can substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B = A + 20, which gives us D + 10 = A + 20. 

We can subtract 10 from both sides to get D = A + 10. 

Now we have A = D - 10 and D = A + 10. 

We can substitute D = A + 10 into the equation A = D - 10, which gives us A = (A + 10) - 10. 

This simplifies to A = A. 

We can substitute D = A + 10 into the equation 2D + A + 10 = 45, which gives us 2(A + 10) + A + 10 = 45. 

This simplifies to 3A + 30 = 45. 

We can subtract 30 from both sides to get 3A = 15. 

We can divide both sides by 3 to get A = 5. 

Now that we know A = 5, we can substitute A = 5 into the equation A = D - 10, which gives us 5 = D - 10. 

We can add 10 to both sides to get D = 15. 

Now that we know D = 15, we can substitute D = 15 into the equation B = D + 10, which gives us B = 15 + 10. 

This simplifies to B = 25. 

Now that we know B = 25 and A = 5, we can substitute B = 25 and A = 5 into the equation B + A + D = 45, which gives us 25 + 5 + 15 = 45. 

This simplifies to 45 = 45. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since there are 100 pages to the inch and each page is printed on both sides, the total number of pages per inch is 100 * 2 = 200 pages per inch.

The book is 1.5 inches thick, so the total number of pages in the book is 200 * 1.5 = 300 pages.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked. He worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know he staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the number of reports he staples per minute, we divide 30 by 15.

30 reports / 15 minutes = 2 reports per minute

Now, we multiply the total number of minutes he worked by the number of reports he staples per minute.

900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find the total time Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she usually sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. The time she was sleepwalking is from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total time she slept on her bed, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from her total sleep time. 

Total sleep time = 480 minutes
Time sleepwalking = 23 minutes
Time slept on bed = Total sleep time - Time sleepwalking
Time slept on bed = 480 - 23
Time slept on bed = 457 minutes

The final answer is: 457"
"To find the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially, we need to first find the number of measuring cups he has. Since he has two dozen cups, we multiply 2 by 12 to get the total number of cups.

2 * 12 = 24 cups

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we multiply the number of cups by 2/3 to find the number of spoons.

24 * (2/3) = 16 spoons

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with:

16 - 6 = 10 spoons

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the remaining spoons and the number of cups.

24 (cups) + 10 (spoons) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the number of occupied beds initially, we need to calculate 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital.

Total capacity = 1000 beds
Occupied beds initially = 1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds

Since the hospital has 200 occupied beds initially, the number of unoccupied beds is:
Unoccupied beds initially = Total capacity - Occupied beds initially
= 1000 - 200
= 800 beds

Now, let's calculate the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 14 days in 2 weeks.

Number of patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 patients/day * 14 days
= 700 patients

Now, let's calculate the total occupied beds after 2 weeks:
Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = Occupied beds initially + Number of patients admitted in 2 weeks
= 200 + 700
= 900 beds

Now, let's calculate the total unoccupied beds after 2 weeks:
Total unoccupied beds after 2 weeks = Total capacity - Total occupied beds after 2 weeks
= 1000 - 900
= 100 beds

"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to first find out how many emails are not work-related. 

Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. So, 6 emails are to family.

The other emails (non-work and non-family) are to her boyfriend. Since 6 emails are to family, the number of emails to her boyfriend is 9 - 6 = 3.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.
2. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya.
3. Aliya is 3 years old.

Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old, we can find Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3:
Shawna's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years

Now that we know Shawna's age, we can find her father's age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5:
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9 = 45 years

"Let's break down the information given:

- Jason carried 2 balls.
- Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.
- Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them: 2 (Jason) + 1 (Jeffrey) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

Since the three boys picked up and carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is 7.

"To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to first calculate the total number of holes at the end of the first day and then use that information to find the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.

The pirates dug 10 holes the first day, 13 holes the second day, and 8 holes the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes on the third day. So, the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, there were 4 * 10 = 40 holes at the end of the fourth day.

We know that there were 29 holes at the end of the third day. So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11.

"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got as x. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so we can set up the equation:

x = 70

Since Collins got x + 15 corn chips, we can set up the equation for the total number of corn chips as:

x + (x + 15) + x = total number of corn chips

Substituting x = 70 into the equation, we get:

70 + (70 + 15) + 70 = total number of corn chips
70 + 85 + 70 = total number of corn chips
225 = total number of corn chips

"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, let's find 50% of the cost of supplies: 
50% of $400 = 0.5 * $400 = $200

Now, let's add this to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel:
Cost of travel = Cost of supplies + 50% of cost of supplies
Cost of travel = $400 + $200
Cost of travel = $600

"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L. 

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so A + S + L = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so L = S + 5.

We also know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so S = 4A - 13.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one: A + (S + 5) + S = 339.

This simplifies to A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Now we can substitute the third equation into this one: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.

This simplifies to A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.

Combine like terms: 9A - 21 = 339.

Add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Divide by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the southerly direction is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 10 = 300 miles

The bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the northerly direction is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 2 = 36 miles

The bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the southerly direction is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 22 * 5 = 110 miles

The total distance traveled in the southerly direction is 300 + 110 = 410 miles.

Now, subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction:
Total distance = 410 - 36 = 374 miles

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first determine how many oranges she had initially, then subtract the ones she gave away and kept.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, each containing 20 oranges. So, she had 12 * 20 = 240 oranges initially.

She gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each, which is 2 * 2 = 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 240 = 60 oranges.

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the ones she kept and gave away from the initial amount: 240 - 80 - 60 = 100 oranges.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.
- On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so G = 10.
- On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so A = Sunday's apple pie - 4.
- On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so Sunday's gingerbread = G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.
- On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, we can find the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday. 
A = Sunday's apple pie - 4
A = 15 - 4
A = 11

Now, we can find the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on Saturday and Sunday.
- Total boxes of gingerbread sold = G + Sunday's gingerbread = 10 + 15 = 25
- Total boxes of apple pie sold = A + Sunday's apple pie = 11 + 15 = 26

Now, we can find the total amount earned from gingerbread and apple pie.
- Total amount from gingerbread = 25 * $6 = $150
- Total amount from apple pie = 26 * $15 = $390

Now, we can find the total amount earned for two days.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is 19 years old now.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

From point 3, we can deduce that Emil's brother is currently half of Emil's age when Emil turns 24. Since Emil will be 24, his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

From point 2, we know that when Emil turns 24, his dad will be twice as old as Emil. So, his dad's age when Emil turns 24 will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

Now, we need to find the current age of Emil's dad and brother. Emil's dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old (since Emil is 19 now and will turn 24 in 5 years). Emil's brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother is 43 + 7 = 50.

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie's boots are size 5, Charlie's boots are 5 * 5 = 25.

The average size of the shoes is the sum of their sizes divided by 2. So, the average size is (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to first convert the width of the flower bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between every plant, we need to subtract the width of the plant and the space between plants from the total length of the flower bed. 

Let's assume the number of plants is 'n'. The total width of the plants and the spaces between them is (12 + 18) * n = 30n inches. 

We can set up the equation: 1332 = 30n + 12n (since the plants themselves take up 12 inches each). However, this equation is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that the plants are already in the bed. We need to subtract the width of the plants and the spaces between the plants from the total length of the flower bed, but we also need to account for the fact that the plants are already in the bed. 

Let's recalculate the total width of the plants and the spaces between them. The total width of the plants and the spaces between them is (12 + 18) * (n - 1) = 30(n - 1) inches. 

We can set up the equation: 1332 = 30(n - 1). 

Now, let's solve for 'n': 
1332 = 30(n - 1)
1332 = 30n - 30
1332 + 30 = 30n
1362 = 30n
1362 / 30 = n
45.4 = n

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 45 plants. However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 45 - 17 = 28 more flowers.

The cost of the flowers is 28 * $6 = $168.

The final answer is: $168"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate 1/2 of 18. 

1/2 of 18 is 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day by 7.

9 pretzels/day * 7 days = 63 pretzels

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00
The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Total cost = cost of petunias + cost of sweet potato vines = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations. 

4 sunflowers need 4 * 3 = 12 pounds of soil.
10 carnations need 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil.

The total amount of soil used for sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have a 30-pound bag of soil, the remaining amount of soil for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so they can plant 3 / 1 = 3 roses.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income. 

25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, we need to find out how many months are in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

Now, we need to calculate how much she saves in a year. 
$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so we need to divide the total amount she saves in a year by the cost of one pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can buy.

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: peeling and cooking.

First, let's calculate how long it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we can divide 90 by 6 to get the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp.

90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate how long it takes Emily to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide 90 by 30 to get the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp, then multiply by 10.

90 / 30 = 3
3 * 10 = 30 minutes

However, since peeling and cooking are done sequentially, we need to add the time it takes to peel and cook. 

15 + 30 = 45 minutes

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature. 

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 3 * 2 = 6 degrees. 
Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 4 * 3 = 12 degrees. 
The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees. 
However, the room warmed up by 2 degrees for 2 hours after the air conditioner was turned off, so the net change in temperature is 18 - 2 = 16 degrees.

The final temperature is 16 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to first find out how old Bill's dad was when Bill saw the comet for the second time. 

Since Bill saw the comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, let's call the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet ""x"". Then, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is 3x.

We know that 75 years passed between the two times Bill's dad saw the comet. So, the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet for the second time is x + 75.

Since Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is 3x, we can set up the equation: 3x = x + 75.

Now, let's solve for x:
3x - x = 75
2x = 75
x = 75 / 2
x = 37.5

Now that we know Bill's dad was 37.5 years old when he saw the comet, we can find out how old Bill was when his dad saw the comet. We know that Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, so the difference in their ages is 37.5 - 30 = 7.5 years.

Since Bill was 7.5 years younger than his dad when his dad saw the comet, we can find Bill's age by subtracting 7.5 from 30:
30 - 7.5 = 22.5

So, Bill was 22.5 years old when his dad saw the comet for the first time.

The final answer is: 22.5"
"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and add them together.

1. Checks for the electric bill: 12 months/year * 1 check/month = 12 checks/year
2. Checks for the gas bill: 12 months/year * 1 check/month = 12 checks/year
3. Checks to the church: 12 months/year * 2 checks/month = 24 checks/year
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 quarters/year * 1 check/quarter = 4 checks/year

Now, let's add the total number of checks: 
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks/year

The final answer is: 52"
"To find the number of flights to France, we first need to find the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 flights.

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is (3/4) * 88 = 66. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/2) * (88 - 66) = (1/2) * 22 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, Adam had to contribute $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. The total age of the children is 20, and we know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro. 

The total age of the children can be expressed as: 
Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20
3 + 4 + Helene's age + W = 20

Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 20 / 4 = 5. 
Helene's age = 2 * 5 = 10

Now we can substitute Helene's age into the equation:
3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20
17 + W = 20

To find the age of Wilfred, we need to isolate W:
W = 20 - 17
W = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 
Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

However, before his lawyer donates, Walter's friend gives him $200. 
So, the total amount collected before the lawyer donates = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Walter's lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. 
So, the amount his lawyer will donate = 3 * $2200 = $6600

The final answer is: $6600"
"To find the total number of cookies, we multiply the number of guests by the number of cookies each guest brought. 

Total cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

Since the bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church, we need to find 1/2 of 1500 cookies.

1/2 of 1500 cookies = 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got.

Number of people in the church = 750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's assume the total watermelon is divided into 12 slices (6 adults and 6 kids). 

Let's say each kid gets 1 slice. Since each adult gets twice as big a slice as each kid, each adult gets 2 slices. 

So, the total number of slices each adult gets is 2. 

The total number of slices is 12. 

The percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (2/12) * 100 = 16.67%."
"To find the total time spent on rounds, we need to multiply the number of inpatients by the time spent per inpatient. 

Time spent on rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the time spent on rounds to hours.

Time spent on rounds (in hours) = 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

To find the total time spent on appointments, we multiply the number of appointments by the time spent per appointment.

Time spent on appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes

Converting the time spent on appointments to hours:

Time spent on appointments (in hours) = 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

Total time spent at the clinic = Time spent on rounds + Time spent on appointments
Total time spent at the clinic = 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours

Since Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours to find the time left to update his records.

Time left to update records = 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:
180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Jordan needs 3 hours to make the cake. To be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm, she should start making the cake at 2:00 pm.

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We are given that they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation: 
8x = 64

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, so it is rented 3 * 4 = 12 times in a month (assuming a 4-week month).

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25. 
The cost of students per session is $1.50 per student, and there are 10 students, so the total cost of students per session is 10 * $1.50 = $15.

The total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $15 (students) = $40.

The total cost per month is $40 * 12 = $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter: 64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 56 chocolate bars / 7 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha:
16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5. 

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is 4 * 12 = 48.

The total number of porcupines after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the number of babies born. 

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 48 = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed them to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need, we need to do that next.

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. To find the total cost, we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon.

Total cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Total cost = 8260 * 0.10
Total cost = 826

The final answer is: $826"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to find the number of blue and yellow sticks first. 

We know there are 9 red sticks. 
There are 5 more blue sticks than red, so the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.
The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 
9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the distance traveled by Matteo, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.

To find the distance traveled by Shandy, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.

Now, we subtract the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy to find the difference: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we need to first find the number of male students and then subtract that from the total number of students.

1. Total students = 3000

3. Male students over 16 years old = 1500 / 4 = 375
4. Female students over 16 years old = 1500 - 375 = 1125
5. Students under 16 years old = 3000 / 2 = 1500
6. Male students under 16 years old = 1500 / 2 = 750
7. Female students under 16 years old = 1500 - 750 = 750
8. Total female students = Female students over 16 years old + Female students under 16 years old

"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. 
Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. 
So, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons. 

The amount of water remaining in the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x.

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is 100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%.

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining is 55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%.

However, we are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. This means that the 34% charge remaining after 8 hours is reduced to 28% after the additional 3 hours. To find the charge lost in the last 3 hours, we subtract 28% from 34%: 34% - 28% = 6%.

Since the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour for 3 hours, the total charge lost in the last 3 hours is 7% * 3 = 21%. However, we know that the actual charge lost is 6%. This means that the power bank was not fully charged when Maria went out to the park. 

Let's set up an equation to find the initial charge. Let y be the charge lost in the first 5 hours. We know that y = 45% (9% * 5). 

The charge remaining after 5 hours is 100% - y = 55%. The charge remaining after 8 hours is 55% - 21% = 34%. The charge remaining after 11 hours is 34% - 6% = 28%.

We can set up the equation: 55% - 21% = 34% - 6%. However, this equation is not correct. We need to find the charge lost in the first 5 hours and then find the initial charge.

Let's set up the correct equation. The charge remaining after 8 hours is 34%. The charge remaining after 11 hours is 28%. The charge lost in the last 3 hours is 6%. The charge lost in the first 5 hours is 21%. 

The charge remaining after 5 hours is 55%. The charge remaining after 8 hours is 34%. The charge lost in the last 3 hours is 21% (7% * 3). However, we know that the charge lost in the last 3 hours is 6%. This means that the charge lost in the first 5 hours is 21% - 6% = 15%.

"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and her hourly tips are $15. So, her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Now, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. 

20% of $10,000 is 0.2 * $10,000 = $2000.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000. 

To do this, we divide the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000). 

$2000 / $1000 = 2.

So, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying the other fruits. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:
- 3 peaches at $.5 each: 3 * $.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $.5 each: 4 * $.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $.75 each: 5 * $.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he has already purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Since plums cost $.25 each, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy:
$0.75 / $.25 = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. Since she kept 2 packs, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Next, we need to find out how many packs each friend received. Since there are 10 friends, we divide the total packs given away (13) by the number of friends (10). 

13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend.

Since each pack has 60 pieces, we multiply the number of packs each friend received by the number of pieces in each pack.

1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

78"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to first find the number of pictures in each album. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8 to find the number of pictures in each album. 

72 / 8 = 9

So, there are 9 pictures in each album. 

Since 3 albums were selfies only, the total number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27.

Since 2 albums were portraits, the total number of portraits is 2 * 9 = 18.

The total number of portraits and selfies is 27 + 18 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read 3 pages.

Since James reads 18 pages, we divide 18 by 3 to find the number of sets of 3 pages he reads: 18 / 3 = 6

Now, we multiply the number of sets by the time it takes to read 3 pages: 6 * 10 = 60

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the current number of guests, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, there were 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the remaining guests are 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests checked out late, so the remaining guests are 76 - 15 = 61.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30.

So, the total number of guests after the afternoon check-ins is 61 + 30 = 91.

After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so the total number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

"To find out how many points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of questions in each category and then find out how many Aries is sure to get from each category.

First, let's find out how many questions are easy, average, and difficult. 

40% of 60 questions are easy: 0.4 * 60 = 24 easy questions
The rest are equally divided as average and difficult: 60 - 24 = 36 questions
36 questions are divided into two equal parts: 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions

Now, let's find out how many questions Aries is sure to get from each category:
- Easy questions: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18
- Average questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 'x' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'y'.
2. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation: x = 2y.
3. We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one, so the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * 4 = $12.
4. The total earnings from the sales are $120, which is the sum of the earnings from the small and large stuffed animals. We can write an equation: 4x + 12y = 120.
5. Since x = 2y (from step 2), we can substitute this into the equation from step 4: 4(2y) + 12y = 120.
6. Simplifying the equation, we get: 8y + 12y = 120, which is 20y = 120.
7. To find the value of y, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: y = 120 / 20 = 6.
8. Since x = 2y (from step 2), we can find the value of x by multiplying y by 2: x = 2 * 6 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"

"To find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe, we need to first find out how much he can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. So, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, we know that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. To find out how much 40 dwarves can mine in a day, we multiply 36 by 40: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds.

Since there are 30 days in a month, we multiply 1440 by 30 to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The ratio for the first package is 3/2, and for the second package is 6/4. We can simplify these ratios to 3/2 and 3/2, which means the price increases by a factor of 1.5 for each additional sandwich. 

Since the first package has 2 sandwiches and the second package has 4 sandwiches, the price of the second package is 1.5 times the price of the first package. 

The price of the first package is $3, so the price of the second package is 3 * 1.5 = $4.5. 

Now, we need to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches. Since the price increases by a factor of 1.5 for each additional sandwich, we can multiply the price of the second package by 1.5 twice to get the price of the package with 8 sandwiches. 

4.5 * 1.5 = 6.75 * 1.5 = 10.125

The final answer is: $10.125"
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to subtract the amount he paid from the total cost of the bedroom set.

First, let's find out how much Tom paid for the bedroom set: 
$3000 (total cost) - $1000 (amount he paid) = $2000 (remaining amount)

Since he has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we need to find 10% of $2000:
10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 * 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so she released 6 yellow balloons, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's add up the remaining balloons: 15 red, 7 green, 6 yellow, and 6 blue. 

15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance)

However, the third scenario is dependent on the second scenario not happening. So, we need to find the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension, which is 100% - 40% = 60%. 

Now, we can multiply the probabilities of the first and third scenarios: 50% * 60% = 30%. 

The probability that Marcus convinces the teacher that his dog ate his assignment is 20%, but this is dependent on the normal teacher not giving an extension, which has a 60% chance. So, we multiply 20% by 60% to get 12%.

Now, we add the probabilities of the first and third scenarios: 30% + 12% = 42%.

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 100% - 42% = 58%.

"To find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first find out how many medium-sized beans he can eat, and then find out how many small beans are equivalent to that amount.

Since it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, and he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can set up a proportion to find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. 

Let's say x is the number of small beans equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. Then, 3x = 150. 

To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 150 / 3 = 50.

So, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to find out how many bottles of soda he will place along the driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the number of bottles, we divide the total width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet = 8 bottles

Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next:

8 bottles * 5 seconds = 40 seconds

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and not working while in college. 

The total amount of loans he took is 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000.

The amount of money he lost by not working while in college is 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000.

So, the total amount of money he needs to earn is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After college, his income triples, so he now earns $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

To find out how long it will take him to earn the $300,000, we can divide the total amount by his new income: $300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to find the dimensions of the larger fabric pieces. 

The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. The fabric pieces need to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. 

So, the length of the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet and the width will be 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

The area of one fabric piece is length * width = 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two fabric pieces, he needs to buy 2 * 80 = 160 square feet of fabric.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday is 85 + 17 = 102. 
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 
5 more than twice as many as Tuesday is 204 + 5 = 209. 
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add up the number of letters delivered each day: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The final answer is: 736"

"To find the average loss, we need to calculate the total loss and then divide it by the number of races.

1. First, let's calculate the amount Johnny's dad lost in the first race: -$5.
2. In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, the amount he won in the second race is 2 * (-$5) + $1 = -$9.
3. In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, the amount he lost in the third race is 1.5 * (-$9) = -$13.5.
4. Now, let's calculate the total loss: -$5 + (-$9) + (-$13.5) = -$27.5.
5. Since there were 3 races, we divide the total loss by 3 to find the average loss: -$27.5 / 3 = -$9.17.

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to first calculate their current heights.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet, which is equal to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole's initial height was 50 inches and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's denote the share of the first person as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

The share of the first person is $420."
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to convert 3/8ths to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

In the first set, Rory retrieved x + 4 balls. 
In the third set, he retrieved x / 2 balls.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is equal to 19. So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19.

To solve for x, we need to combine like terms and isolate x. Multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38.

Combine like terms: 2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38.

Combine like terms again: 5x + 8 = 38.

Subtract 8 from both sides: 5x = 30.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 6.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set: x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

Initial price of the car = $20,000
Depreciation rate = 21% per year

Year 2008:
Price in 2008 = Initial price - (Initial price * depreciation rate)
= $20,000 - ($20,000 * 0.21)
= $20,000 - $4,200
= $15,800

Year 2009:
Price in 2009 = Price in 2008 - (Price in 2008 * depreciation rate)
= $15,800 - ($15,800 * 0.21)
= $15,800 - $3,328
= $12,472

Year 2010:
Price in 2010 = Price in 2009 - (Price in 2009 * depreciation rate)
= $12,472 - ($12,472 * 0.21)
= $12,472 - $2,620.32
= $9,851.68

The final answer is: $9851.68"
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to find the total number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

10% of the books are written in German, so that's 10% of 50, which is 0.1 * 50 = 5 books in German.

The total number of books written in English and German is 25 + 5 = 30.

Since there are 50 books in total, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20.

"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to calculate the number of people at each stop and add them up.

Initially, Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the total number of people becomes 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100) board the train. So, the total number of people becomes 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the total number of people becomes 190 - 80 = 110.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"To find the total amount Alison spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55

"To find the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, we need to find the area of a single tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of a single tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Next, we need to find the total number of tiles required to cover the kitchen floor. Since the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt and each tile covers 1 SqFt, we need 200 tiles.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost of each tile: 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72

"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since a twin bed has 1 set of sheets and a king size bed has 1 set of sheets, he puts 4 + 1 = 5 sets of sheets on the beds every week.

Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 1, which is 2. This means he can wash 2 twin sets of sheets and 1 king set of sheets at a time.

However, since he has 5 sets of sheets to wash, he will need to wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set in one load, and then wash the remaining 2 twin sets in another load. So, he does 2 loads of laundry every week.

To find out how many loads of laundry he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads he does in a week by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year.

2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads/year

"Let's denote Donovan's part as D and Betsy's part as B. We know that B = D + 18 and the total time is 98 minutes, so D + B = 98.

Substituting B = D + 18 into the second equation, we get D + (D + 18) = 98.

Combine like terms: 2D + 18 = 98.

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2D = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: D = 40.

Since B = D + 18, B = 40 + 18 = 58.

So, James doesn't respond to 16 emails. 

The rest of the emails he responds to is 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Since James works 5 days a week, we need to multiply the number of emails he responds to in a day by 5. 

64 * 5 = 320 emails.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

He wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, so he will send out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

The total cost of postage is the sum of the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

"To find the total cost of the butter, we need to calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter with the promotion. 

Since Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter. 

The promotion is buy one pound of butter get one half off, which means that for every 2 pounds of butter, he will pay the full price of 1 pound. 

So, for 6 pounds of butter, he will pay for 3 pounds (6/2 = 3) at the full price of $4.00 per pound, and the other 3 pounds will be half off. 

The cost of 3 pounds at the full price is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00. 

The cost of 3 pounds at half off is 3 * ($4.00 / 2) = $6.00.

The total cost of 6 pounds of butter is $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat each day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats. However, we know that the total number of bananas is 315 and they eat this amount for a week, which is 7 days. 

So, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315 * 7 = 2205 bananas. 

Since they eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas per day, the total number of bananas eaten in a week by the first two monkeys is 24 * 7 = 168 bananas.

Now, we subtract the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten in a week to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats in a week: 2205 - 168 = 2037 bananas.

However, this is the total number of bananas the third monkey eats in a week, not per day. To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day, we divide the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7: 2037 / 7 = 291.8571428571. 

Since the third monkey can't eat a fraction of a banana, we round down to the nearest whole number."

"To find out how much Jenny paid for the roses, we need to determine if she bought the roses by the dozen or individually. Since she bought 15 roses, it's more cost-effective to buy a dozen (12 roses) and 3 individual roses. 

A dozen roses cost $15, and 3 individual roses cost 3 * $2 = $6. So, the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. 

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she paid with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

"To find the total time Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time Paul will wait after the third train leaves.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, we need to find the time Paul will wait for his train. Paul will wait from the time he arrives at the station to the time the fourth train arrives. Since we don't know the time Paul arrives at the station, we will assume he arrives at time 0. 

The time Paul will wait for his train is 145 minutes.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and then the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is 75% of $2000, which is 0.75 * 2000 = $1500.

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is 1.2 * 1500 = $1800.

The discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend is the difference between the original price and the price he paid, which is $2000 - $1800 = $200.

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, the total number of jellyfish created by one spring in 14400 seconds is 14400.

Now, we need to find the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in the same time frame. 

14400 jellyfish/spring * 5 springs = 72000 jellyfish

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score. 

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180.

Frankie's score is 15 better than twice Binkie's score, so we add 15 to 180. 

Frankie's score is 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To find the total distance James walked, we need to calculate the round trip. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back home, the total distance is 2 * 4 = 8 miles.

Since James walks 4 miles per hour, we can find the total time by dividing the total distance by his speed. 

Time = Total Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

"To find the total cost of buying bananas individually, we need to calculate the cost of 10 bunches of bananas with 4 bananas each. 

First, let's find the total number of bananas: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be: 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Now, let's find the cost of buying the bananas in bunches: 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

To find the amount saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet. 

Since they have 100 feet of fence in total, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the rate at which the crocodile grows per year, we need to divide the growth in inches by the number of years. 

Growth per year = Total growth / Number of years
Growth per year = 8 inches / 4 years
Growth per year = 2 inches/year

Now, we can multiply the growth per year by the total number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth in 13 years = Growth per year * Total years
Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years
Total growth in 13 years = 26 inches

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

Let's start by finding the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the total earnings:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find the number of bales left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck, then subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the total number of bales made is 5 * 6 = 30.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the total number of bales picked up is 3 * 6 = 18.

To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we first need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class per day. 

There are 6 periods in a day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes per day is 6 * 40 = 240 minutes.

Since John goes to class for 5 days a week, the total minutes per week is 240 * 5 = 1200 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the extra minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on each of these days. 

First, we need to find the total minutes in a week. There are 7 days in a week, and there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, the total minutes in a week is 7 * 60 * 24 = 10080 minutes.

Now, we can find the extra minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday: 1/16 * 10080 = 630 minutes.

Since John spends the same amount of time on both Saturday and Sunday, we need to divide the extra minutes by 2: 630 / 2 = 315 minutes.

Now, we can add the minutes John spends in class and the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday: 1200 + 315 = 1515 minutes.

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 1515 / 60 = 25.25 hours.

The height of the ball after the second bounce is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to convert the height of the first child to inches and then calculate the height of each child step by step.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the height of the first child in inches is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the height of the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the height of the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the height of the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10).

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"To find the original weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the 270 kilograms left after the Allosaurus ate.

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which is half of what was left after the velociraptors ate. So, the velociraptors ate the other half, which is also 270 kilograms.

Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left, the total weight after the T-Rex ate is 2 times 270 kilograms, which is 540 kilograms.

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate is 2 times 540 kilograms, which is 1080 kilograms.

The final answer is: 1080"
"To find the total area to be painted, we need to calculate the area of all four walls. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet.
The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet.
The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the total number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so 3 were shaken and 9 were unshaken. Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 1 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 7 sodas in total, with 1 shaken and 6 unshaken. The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans.

Probability = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of cans)
Probability = 1 / 7

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Probability = (1 / 7) * 100
Probability = 14.29%

The final answer is: 14.29"
"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

The total distance between the two trains is the sum of the distances they have traveled, which is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find the total number of days Billy helps, we first need to find the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

However, Billy takes 20% of these days off. 20% of 50 is 0.2 * 50 = 10. So, he takes 10 days off.

The number of days he helps is 50 - 10 = 40.

Since Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

The total number of people he helps is 40 * 6 = 240.

"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people who were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people who were present.

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses:
12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars:
20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the number of people transported from the total number of people present. However, the question does not provide the total number of people present. It only provides the number of private cars and buses. We can assume that the number of people present is equal to the number of people transported (i.e., 480 people) since the question does not provide any other information.

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is equal to the number of people transported, which is 480.

The final answer is: 480"

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of each slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time = 3 minutes

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the two slides:
Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide

"To find the total time spent on lunches and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 
- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes
- Total time per day: 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Bobby takes 1 hour of lunch and breaks per day. 
After 5 days, the total time spent on lunches and breaks is:
1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we multiply 8 by 3.5 to find Micah's total.

8 * 3.5 = 28

Now that we know Micah ran 28 miles, we can subtract the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles run by all three to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Total miles run by all three = 52
Miles run by Amber = 8
Miles run by Micah = 28
Miles run by Ahito = Total miles run by all three - (Miles run by Amber + Miles run by Micah)
Miles run by Ahito = 52 - (8 + 28)
Miles run by Ahito = 52 - 36
Miles run by Ahito = 16

"Let's break down the information given:

- A fifth of the jellyfish are large.
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
- The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue.
- When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. 
A third of the large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, so x/15 = 6. 

To find the total number of jellyfish, we need to solve for x:
x/15 = 6
x = 6 * 15
x = 90

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for her retirement. 

First, let's calculate her annual expenses in retirement: 
40% of $100,000 = 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

Since she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, the total amount she needs to save is:
$40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

Now, let's calculate how much she saves per year. 
20% of $100,000 = 0.2 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

To find out how many years she needs to work to save $800,000, we can divide the total amount by her annual savings:
$800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for her retirement. Since she already plans to live for 20 years in retirement, we need to subtract this from the total number of years:
40 - 20 = 20 years.

"To find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

To find out how many days it will take her to hike 9,300 miles, we divide the total miles by the miles per day: 9,300 / 250 = 37.2 days.

Since Soledad has 30 days in June, she will not be able to complete her journey on time. To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we need to calculate the total miles she needs to hike per day to complete her journey in 30 days.

The total miles she needs to hike per day is 9,300 / 30 = 310 miles per day.

Since she is currently hiking 250 miles per day, she needs to hike 310 - 250 = 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg. 

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

So, Pierre and Paul will take 3 + 4 = 7 kg in total.

Since there are 3 people in total, and we know that Pierre and Paul will take 7 kg, we can assume that James will take the remaining amount. 

However, the question does not mention James initially, it mentions Pierre, Paul, and Jacques. It seems like there might be a mix-up in the names. Assuming Jacques is the one who will be left with the remaining amount, we can calculate it as follows:

"To find the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers, we first need to find the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour and the 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour produce a total of 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour produce a total of 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour.

So, the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since they work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers is 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

The manufacturer still needs 20 toys to ship the order, and the total number of toys ordered is 400. So, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Since the 4 workers produce 200 toys, the fifth worker must produce 380 - 200 = 180 toys.

The fifth worker works for 10 hours, so the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour is 180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds. So, Elijah's first dog weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds. So, Elijah's second dog weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

The total weight of Elijah's dogs is 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

The total weight of all the dogs is 45 (Elijah's dogs) + 60 (Kory's dog) = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Kris had 7 stickers, and before giving them to Rob, he had 7 + 9 = 16 stickers.
2. Since Kris had 16 stickers, and he received them from Luis, Luis must have had 16 stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received from Seth, so he must have received twice as many stickers from Seth. Therefore, Seth gave Luis 16 * 2 = 32 stickers.
4. Since Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, Seth must have had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers in the beginning.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find the total number of M&M's, we need to multiply the number of large bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply by the number of M&M's per ounce. 

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Since John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, we need to divide the total number of M&M's by 10 to find the number of small bags.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to first calculate half of the circumference of the earth. 

Half of the circumference of the earth is 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km.

Since Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, we can find the number of days it will take him to fly 20,000 km by dividing 20,000 km by 400 km/day.

20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to first find the speed of the 2nd fastest car. 

The average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so the 2nd fastest car's speed is 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.

The faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so the faster car's speed is 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Liam is 16 years old now.
2. Two years ago, Liam's age was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.
3. Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince, so Vince's age two years ago was 14 / 2 = 7 years old.
4. To find Vince's current age, we need to add 2 years to his age two years ago: 7 + 2 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so A = M.

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. This can be expressed as C + S = 30 and C = S + 12.

We can rewrite the second equation as C = S + 12 and substitute it into the first equation: (S + 12) + S = 30.

Combine like terms: 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2S = 18.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 9.

Now that we know S, we can find C: C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, and A + M + C + S = 56, we can substitute the values of C and S: A + M + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combine like terms: A + M + 30 = 56.

Subtract 30 from both sides: A + M = 26.

Since A = M, we can substitute A with M: M + M = 26.

Combine like terms: 2M = 26.

Divide both sides by 2: M = 13.

Now that we know M, we can find A: A = M = 13.

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes separately.

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and Nik has 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces and Nik has 200 crayons, he will need 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

The total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 200 (crayons) + 200 (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, the total weight in pounds is 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to calculate 80% of 80 feet. 

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet long, we need to divide the total length by the length of each log to find out how many logs he can make.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks, so we multiply the number of logs by 5 to find out how many planks he can make.

16 * 5 = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank to find out how much he makes.

80 * 1.2 = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Valerie earns $5000 per month.
2. Valerie's brother earns 2 times what Valerie earns, so he earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.
3. Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.
4. Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.
5. To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk.
2. On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. Let's denote her speed on the beach as 'x'. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x.
3. The time taken to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/x hours, since time = distance/speed.
4. The time taken to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/(2x) hours, since her speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach.
5. The total time taken to walk 3 miles is 2/x + 1/(2x) hours.
6. We are given that 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach. We need to convert this to hours: 40 minutes = 40/60 = 2/3 hours.
7. Since 2/3 hours is spent on the beach, the time taken to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/3 hours.
8. We can equate the time taken to walk 2 miles on the beach to 2/x: 2/x = 2/3.
9. Solving for x, we get x = 3.
10. Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find the time taken to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk: 1/(2x) = 1/(2*3) = 1/6 hours.
11. The total time taken to walk 3 miles is 2/3 + 1/6 hours.
12. Converting 2/3 to a common denominator, we get 4/6 + 1/6 = 5/6 hours.
13. Converting 5/6 hours to minutes, we get 5/6 * 60 = 50 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save $60, we need to first calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is:
$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60:
$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each group of trees and then add them together.

3 trees had 7 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 3 x 7 = 21.

2 trees had 4 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 2 x 4 = 8.

1 tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the number of blue birds in each group together: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. So, Bob will have 60 marbles after receiving 24 more marbles.

2. To find out how many marbles Bob has initially, we need to subtract 24 from 60. 
   Initial marbles = 60 - 24 = 36

3. If Bob loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from the initial number of marbles he had.
   Marbles after losing 10 = 36 - 10 = 26

"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle. 

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the two temperatures multiplied by the total ounces.

Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

20 (initial chickens) + (10 chickens/day * 21 days) = 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is the sum of the cows and chickens.

470 (cows) + 230 (chickens) = 700

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the total cost of the bagels, first, we need to calculate the original price of 4 packs of bagels. 

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs will cost 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $40.00 and subtract it from the original price.

10% of $40.00 is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, subtract the discount from the original price: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, and Russell ordered 4 packs, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we need to divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate, we first need to find out how many scoops 1 less than 3 scoops is. 

1 less than 3 scoops is 3 - 1 = 2 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, so it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops.

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, Gomer ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops, it takes 3 * 2 = 6 potatoes to make 6 scoops. 

To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to find out how many groups of 6 scoops are in 18 scoops. 18 / 6 = 3. 

So, Gomer ate 3 * 6 = 18 potatoes."
"To find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. 
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total number of eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.
240 eggs / 12 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to find the total number of red jellybeans. We know that there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans. 

So, the number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34.

We know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We already know the number of green and red jellybeans, so we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the number of green and red jellybeans from the total.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
= 60 - (17 + 34)
= 60 - 51

"To find the number of women on the bus initially, we need to first find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 9 = 14. 

The fraction of the total number of passengers that are women is 9/14. 

To find the number of women on the bus initially, we multiply the fraction by the total number of passengers: (9/14) * 84 = 54.

Now, we need to subtract the number of women who alighted from the bus: 54 - 20 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we need to first find the total number of sunflowers sold per day and then multiply it by 3.

Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers per day. Since each sunflower costs $2, the number of sunflowers sold per day is 26 / 2 = 13.

Faraday also earned $56 from the bouquets per day. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers and costs $8, the number of bouquets sold per day is 56 / 8 = 7. The number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is 7 * 12 = 84.

The total number of sunflowers sold per day is 13 (from individual sunflowers) + 84 (from bouquets) = 97.

The total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days is 97 * 3 = 291.

"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference between the two.

Adam has $100 to invest, and each rock costs $5. To find out how many rocks he can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Since Adam sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 60% of 20 rocks:

60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

12 * $7 = $84

The cost of buying 20 rocks at $5 each is:

20 * $5 = $100

Since Adam only sells 12 rocks, he still has 8 rocks left, which he has to pay for. The cost of these 8 rocks is:

8 * $5 = $40

The total cost of the rocks is the cost of the rocks he sold plus the cost of the rocks he didn't sell:

$100 + $40 = $140

However, Adam only made $84 from selling the rocks. To find out how much money he loses, we subtract the revenue from the total cost:

$140 - $84 = $56

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of large, medium, and small-sized picture scenes Lauren needs to draw. 

First, let's find the LCM of 45, 36, and 49. 

The prime factorization of 45 is 3^2 * 5.
The prime factorization of 36 is 2^2 * 3^2.
The prime factorization of 49 is 7^2.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
LCM(45, 36, 49) = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5 * 7^2 = 4 * 9 * 5 * 49 = 8820.

Now, let's find out how many days it will take Lauren to draw each type of picture scene:
- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

The greatest common multiple of these days is 63 days, but we can also find the LCM of 9, 6, and 7 to confirm. 

The prime factorization of 9 is 3^2.
The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3.
The prime factorization of 7 is 7.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
LCM(9, 6, 7) = 2 * 3^2 * 7 = 42.

Since 63 is a multiple of 42, we can confirm that 63 days is the correct answer.

The final answer is: 63"

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.2 in decimal form. 
The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability of both tickets winning, we multiply the probabilities: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

1. Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. 
   So, Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

2. Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. 
   So, Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

3. The total number of seashells collected is 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.

4. They divided the seashells equally among themselves. 
   So, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). 
So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. 
So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week.
Total carrots eaten in a week = 20 (weekdays) + 10 (weekend) = 30.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to find the length of the second song first. 

The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (which is the decimal form of 60%). 

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now we have the lengths of both songs: 5 minutes for the first song and 8 minutes for the second song. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the profit from each day and then add them together.

On Monday, Linus bought 2 devices for $20 each. He sold each device for twice the amount, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the profit from each device is $40 - $20 = $20. Since he bought 2 devices, the total profit from Monday is 2 * $20 = $40.

On Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each. He sold each device for twice the amount, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the profit from each device is $40 - $20 = $20. Since he bought 4 devices, the total profit from Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of one person. 

Since each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, Hortex would need 100% / 20% = 5 times the number of bottles.

Now, we need to find out how many bottles are needed for 2300 people. Since one person needs 5 bottles, 2300 people would need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

However, Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce, we need to divide the total number of bottles needed by the number of bottles Hortex can produce per day.

11500 / 4200 = 2.74 (round up to 3 since you can't produce a fraction of a bottle)

So, Hortex would need to produce 3 - 2 = 1 more bottle per day to meet the demand, but since 2.74 is more than 2, they would need to produce 1 more bottle per day to meet the demand of 2300 people.

However, the question asks how many more bottles Hortex would have to produce to be able to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, and 2300 people need 11500 bottles, Hortex would need to produce 11500 - 4200 = 7300 more bottles per day.

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the number of babies wearing purple and bows, and then divide it by the total number of babies wearing bows.

Let's start by finding the number of babies wearing purple. Since Carla has 8 babies and 3/4 of them wear purple, we can calculate the number of purple babies as follows:

Number of purple babies = 8 * (3/4) = 6

Now, let's find the number of babies wearing purple and bows. 1/3 of the purple babies wear bows, so we can calculate the number of purple babies wearing bows as follows:

Number of purple babies wearing bows = 6 * (1/3) = 2

Next, let's find the total number of babies wearing bows. We know that 1/4 of the babies wear blue, and all of them wear bows. So, the number of blue babies wearing bows is:

Number of blue babies wearing bows = 8 * (1/4) = 2

Since the total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of purple babies wearing bows and blue babies wearing bows, we can calculate it as follows:

Total number of babies wearing bows = 2 (purple) + 2 (blue) = 4

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple by dividing the number of purple babies wearing bows by the total number of babies wearing bows and multiplying by 100:

Percentage chance = (2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. 

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. 

The remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $60 from the third sale. 

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs found is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Initially, Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen is 12, 3 dozen is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to find the size of the third apartment complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so their combined size is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400.

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. Adding this to 400 gives 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

So, the total number of apartments is 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects from 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the fruits produced each year and add them up.

- Year 1 (5 years old): 50 fruits
- Year 2 (6 years old): 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
- Year 3 (7 years old): 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- Year 4 (8 years old): 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, but we don't know the production of a 10-year-old tree yet. Let's call the production of a 10-year-old tree 'x'. So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is x - 200.
- Year 5 (9 years old): 0 fruits (no production)
- Year 6 (10 years old): 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, we need to find the production of a 10-year-old tree to calculate the production of an 8-year-old tree. We know that a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. 

Now we can find the production of an 8-year-old tree: x - 200 = 1000. Solving for x, we get x = 1200.

Now we can find the production of an 8-year-old tree: x - 200 = 1200 - 200 = 1000 fruits.

Now we can add up the fruits produced each year:

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R. 

We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so B = Y - 7.

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so R = 4B.

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so Y + B + R = 37.

Substituting the expressions for B and R in terms of Y into the equation, we get Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37.

Combine like terms: Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37.

Combine like terms again: 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides: 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6: Y = 12.

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope: B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5.

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope: R = 4B = 4 * 5 = 20.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so if Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

2. After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount given 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

3. According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money. This means that $15 - x = (4/5) * $15.

4. To find the value of x, we can solve the equation: $15 - x = (4/5) * $15.
   $15 - x = $12
   x = $3

5. Now that we know the value of x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with: $5 - x = $5 - $3 = $2.

"Let's break down the information given:

- There are four colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow.
- There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
- Half the mural is yellow.
- The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is the combination of red, white, and purple paint. Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as x. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the total amount of these three colors is 3x.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow. So, the other half is 6 pints (12 / 2 = 6). This 6 pints is the combination of red, white, and purple paint, which is 3x.

We can set up the equation: 3x = 6

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 6 / 3
x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and we know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since he withdraws 1000 dollars in 20 dollar bills, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home. So, he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills to pay for the bill. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he has 20 bills left, and each bill is worth $20, he has 20 * 20 = $400. Tripling this amount gives him 3 * 400 = $1200.

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we need to divide the total amount of money by 5. 1200 / 5 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by both teams in the first and second halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then divide it by the amount of chalk used each day.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of it. 

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

So, after Monday, 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk is left.

The teacher then goes back to using 20% of the chalk each day. 

To find out how many days the chalk will last, we need to divide the remaining chalk by the amount used each day.

20% of 5 inches = 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch

Now, divide the remaining chalk by the amount used each day: 

2.75 inches / 1 inch = 2.75 days

The final answer is: 2.75"
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to find the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4.
One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
20 = C

"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza that her friends will eat. 

For cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is 6 * 6 = 36. 

For pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 4 * 6 = 24.

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find out how many whole pizzas are needed for each type. 

For cheese pizza, 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas. 

For pepperoni pizza, 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, she needs a total of 3 + 3 = 6 pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many snowballs Jay builds and how many melt in a given time period. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is 60 minutes. So, in 15 minutes, he builds 20/60 * 15 = 5 snowballs. 

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. So, in 15 minutes, Jay has 5 - 2 = 3 snowballs left.

Since Jay starts with 0 snowballs, he needs to repeat this process until he has 60 snowballs. 

In the first 15 minutes, Jay has 3 snowballs. In the next 15 minutes, he builds 5 more and has 3 + 5 - 2 = 6 snowballs. 

In the next 15 minutes, he builds 5 more and has 6 + 5 - 2 = 9 snowballs. 

In the next 15 minutes, he builds 5 more and has 9 + 5 - 2 = 12 snowballs. 

In the next 15 minutes, he builds 5 more and has 12 + 5 - 2 = 15 snowballs. 

In the next 15 minutes, he builds 5 more and has 15 + 5 - 2 = 18 snowballs. 

In the next 15 minutes, he builds 5 more and has 18 + 5 - 2 = 21 snowballs. 

In the next 15 minutes, he builds 5 more and has 21 + 5 - 2 = 24 snowballs. 

In the next 15 minutes, he builds 5 more and has 24 + 5 - 2 = 27 snowballs. 

In the next 15 minutes, he builds 5 more and has 27 + 5 - 2 = 30 snowballs. 

In the next 15 minutes, he builds 5 more and has 30 + 5 - 2 = 33 snowballs. 

In the next 15 minutes, he builds 5 more and has 33 + 5 - 2 = 36 snowballs. 

In the next 15 minutes, he builds 5 more and has 36 + 5 - 2 = 39 snowballs. 

In the next 15 minutes, he builds 5 more and has 39 + 5 - 2 = 42 snowballs. 

In the next 15 minutes, he builds 5 more and has 42 + 5 - 2 = 45 snowballs. 

In the next 15 minutes, he builds 5 more and has 45 + 5 - 2 = 48 snowballs. 

In the next 15 minutes, he builds 5 more and has 48 + 5 - 2 = 51 snowballs.

"To find out how many slices each person ate, let's break it down step by step:

1. Doxa ate 1 slice.
2. Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
3. Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices each person ate: 
Doxa ate 1 slice, her sister ate 2 slices, and her brother ate 3 slices. 
So, the total number of slices they ate is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

"Let's break down the information given:

- On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
- On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages (since 50 / 2 = 25).
- At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x. After the first day, they had x - 38 + 50 bandages. After the second day, they had (x - 38 + 50) - 28 bandages. After the third day, they had ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) + 100 - 25 bandages.

We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages. So, we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78

Simplifying the equation:

x - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78
x + 57 = 78

Subtract 57 from both sides:

x = 21

The initial number of bandages was 21.

- On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, so he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day.
- On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total number of White Oak trees is 20 + 10 = 30.
- He planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days:
Total White Oak trees = 20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 30

Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes per day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day.

Since Jordan's wife changes 5 diapers per day, Jordan changes the remaining half, which is also 5 diapers per day.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total volume of the jar, we need to multiply the length, width, and height of the jar. 

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume used by the jelly beans will be 80% of the total volume.

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Since a jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of a single jelly bean.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of a single jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between his guess and the true number of red jelly beans.

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Number of red jelly beans estimated by Tim (which is not given, so we will assume he guessed 864)
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

However, since we do not know what Tim guessed, we will assume he guessed 864."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the bus had 20 people.
2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.
3. At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first stop, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.
4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, the bus has 200 - 180 = 20 spaces left.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for the first 5 years and the cost of visits for the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

The cost of one visit increased by 150% after 5 years. A 150% increase means the new cost is 2.5 times the original cost. So, the new cost of one visit is $2 * 2.5 = $5.

For the next 3 years, the annual cost is 3 * $5 = $15. For 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

The total cost for all visits is $30 + $45 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups and the total time required for all students to participate.

There are 4 grades (4-7) with 10 students in each grade, so the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find the total number of groups: 40 / 8 = 5.

Each group uses 45 minutes to try and escape, so the total time required for all students to participate is the number of groups multiplied by the time per group: 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the tables and the total cost of the roof frames, then add them together.

The cost of the tables is 4 * $20 = $80.
The cost of the roof frames is 2 * $10 = $20.

The total cost is $80 + $20 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece (4x):

4x = 4 * 8 = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of ground beef

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef, we can multiply the total pounds of meat by the amount of seasoning per pound to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

5 pounds of ground beef * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the width of one window by the number of windows. 

Width of one window: 35 inches
Number of windows: 5

Total width of windows = 35 * 5 = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Fabric needed = 2 * 175 = 350 inches

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the total cost of the call, we need to calculate the cost for the first 16 minutes and the cost for the remaining minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is 16 * $0.25 = $4.

For the remaining 20 minutes (36 - 16 = 20), the cost is 20 * $0.2 = $4.

The total cost is $4 + $4 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we need to calculate the amount of rain on Monday (2 inches) and then find twice that amount, and add 1 inch to it.

Twice the amount of rain on Monday is 2 * 2 = 4 inches.
Adding 1 more inch to that is 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. 
- Let's denote the number of cupcakes as C and the number of brownies as B. 
- We can express the relationship between the number of cupcakes and brownies as B = 3C - 2.

- Each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. 
- The total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since the total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, we can write the equation: C + B = 10.

Substituting the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation, we get: C + (3C - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4C - 2 = 10.

Add 2 to both sides: 4C = 12.

Divide by 4: C = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total cost, first, calculate the discount on the manicure and pedicure. 

The discount on the manicure is 20% of $35, which is 0.2 * 35 = $7. 
The discount on the pedicure is 20% of $40, which is 0.2 * 40 = $8.

The total discount is $7 + $8 = $15.

The cost of the manicure after the discount is $35 - $7 = $28.
The cost of the pedicure after the discount is $40 - $8 = $32.

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure is $28 + $32 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers, the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art is $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them up.

The first 3 magazines send 12 issues a year, so that's 3 * 12 = 36 issues.

The second magazine sends 6 issues a year.

The third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues.

Now, let's add up the total number of issues: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

The final answer is: 66"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Samantha has 27 paintings.
2. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley.
   So, Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.
3. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim.
   So, Kim has 39 - 8 = 31 paintings.

"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make, we need to calculate the amount from the standard lessons and the amount from the veteran lessons, then add them together.

The standard lessons are 4 hours long, and Charlie charges $80 per hour. So, the total amount from the standard lessons is 4 * 80 = $320.

The veteran lessons are 2 hours long, and Charlie reduces his rate by 25%. This means he charges 75% of his standard rate, which is 0.75 * 80 = $60 per hour. So, the total amount from the veteran lessons is 2 * 60 = $120.

Now, we add the amounts from the standard lessons and the veteran lessons: 320 + 120 = $440.

"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first determine how many pomelos she had left. Since she was left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can calculate this as follows:

Original amount: 20 pomelos
1/4 of the original amount: 20 * 1/4 = 5 pomelos

Since Eve was left with 5 pomelos, we can find out how many she gave away by subtracting the amount she had left from the original amount:

Pomelos given away: 20 - 5 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the number of apples Walter ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60. 

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. 

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

60 - 24 = 36

Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. 

25% of 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. 

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each. 

27 * 3 = 81

The final answer is: 81"
"To find the total number of novels Regina wrote this year, we need to determine the total number of novels she wrote last year and then multiply it by 4 (since 3 quarters is 3/4, and 4 is the total number of quarters in a year).

Let's start by setting up the equation:

9 novels = 3/4 * x

To find x, we can multiply both sides by 4/3:

9 * (4/3) = x
12 = x

So, Regina wrote 12 novels this year."
"To find the total distance covered by Michael in 3 days, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours he travels in 3 days. 

Since there are 24 hours in a day, Michael travels for 3 * 24 = 72 hours in 3 days. 

Now, we multiply his average speed by the total hours traveled: 
50 km/hr * 72 hr = 3600 km

Now, we need to find the percentage of the distance covered by Michael. To do this, we divide the distance covered by the total distance between Alaska and Texas and multiply by 100:

(3600 km / 6000 km) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.
3. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.
4. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.
5. The total number of grapes used by all three is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.
6. Since Madeline ate 6 grapes initially, the total number of grapes at the beginning is 84 + 6 = 90 grapes.

The cost of pasta per week is $1.00.
The cost of cheddar cheese per week is $3.00.
The cost of gruyere cheese per week is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

The total cost per week is $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

To find the total cost per year, multiply the weekly cost by 52:
$10.00 * 52 = $520.00

The final answer is: $520.00"
"To find the total number of minutes the custodian works in a day, we multiply the number of hours by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day

The total number of classrooms is 80, and it takes 15 minutes per classroom. 

80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

The total number of minutes the custodian needs to clean all classrooms is 1200 minutes. 

To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we divide the total minutes spent cleaning by the total minutes worked in a day, and then multiply by 100.

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms on average."
"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to determine the capacity of each shelf. 

The middle shelves can hold 10 books each. 
The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.
The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:
Middle shelf 1: 10 books
Middle shelf 2: 10 books
Bottom shelf: 20 books
Top shelf: 15 books
Total capacity of one bookcase: 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase to find out how many bookcases she needs:
110 / 55 = 2

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total cost of the eggs, we need to multiply the number of dozens by the cost per dozen. 

5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the total number of eggs is 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Rose will sell the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs. To find the selling price per egg, we divide $1 by 3.

$1 / 3 = $0.33 per egg

Now, we multiply the total number of eggs by the selling price per egg to find the total revenue.

60 eggs * $0.33/egg = $20

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to find out how many questions she needs to get right in total. 

First, let's find out how many questions she got right on the first test. 
60% of 70 questions is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions right, and the total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110, she needs to get 70% of 110 questions right. 
70% of 110 is 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. We are given that B = 5S - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so S + B = 116.

Substituting B = 5S - 4 into the second equation, we get S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know S = 20, we can find B by substituting S into the equation B = 5S - 4: B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 is 4, so 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each.

The total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.
The total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40

"To find John's new speaking speed, we need to multiply his original speed by 2.5. 

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can convert WPM to words per second by dividing by 60.

New speed (words per second) = 375 WPM / 60 = 6.25 words per second

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. 

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words per page = 4500 words

To find the time it takes to speak 4500 words, we can divide the total number of words by the new speed.

Time = Total words / New speed (words per second) = 4500 words / 6.25 words per second = 720 seconds

"To find the total cost of the place settings, we need to calculate the cost of each type of plate and then multiply it by the number of people. 

Dinner plates cost $6.00 each and Avery needs 12 plates, so the total cost of dinner plates is 6 * 12 = $72.

Bowls cost $5.00 each and Avery needs 12 bowls, so the total cost of bowls is 5 * 12 = $60.

Salad plates cost $4.00 each and Avery needs 12 salad plates, so the total cost of salad plates is 4 * 12 = $48.

The total cost of the place settings is the sum of the cost of dinner plates, bowls, and salad plates: 72 + 60 + 48 = $180.

"To find out how long it took Anna to finish the puzzle, we need to first determine half of Steve's time. 

Steve's time is 10 hours. Half of 10 hours is 10 / 2 = 5 hours.

Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time, so we add 2 hours to 5 hours. 
5 + 2 = 7 hours.

"To find out how much feed is left, we need to calculate how much feed the pigs eat in a day and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so each pig eats 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of feed per day.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total amount of feed they eat per day is 5 * 8 = 40 pounds.

In a week, the pigs eat 40 * 7 = 280 pounds of feed.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so to find out how much is left, we subtract the amount eaten from the total amount ordered: 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many hot dogs John needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party. 

The total number of guests is 20, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. So, the total number of hot dogs needed is 20 * 2 = 40.

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. So, the total number of hot dogs he needs to buy is 40 - 4 = 36.

Since each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, we need to find out how many packs John needs to buy. 

To do this, we divide the total number of hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs in a pack: 36 / 6 = 6.

Since each pack costs $2, the total amount John needs to spend on hot dogs is 6 * 2 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much money Frances has left, we need to calculate her total earnings and subtract her total expenses.

Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 20 x $2 = $40.
She sells 40 cookies at $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 40 x $1 = $40.
Her total earnings are $40 + $40 = $80.

Frances buys 5 trays at $4 each, so her total expenses are 5 x $4 = $20.

To find out how much money Frances has left, we subtract her expenses from her earnings: $80 - $20 = $60.

"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them together.

Meditation time per day: 15 minutes (morning) + 15 minutes (night) = 30 minutes
Since Charisma practices meditation 7 days a week, the total meditation time per week is: 30 minutes * 7 days = 210 minutes

Yoga time per day: 1 hour = 60 minutes
Since Charisma practices yoga 5 days a week, the total yoga time per week is: 60 minutes * 5 days = 300 minutes

Total time spent on meditation and yoga per week: 210 minutes (meditation) + 300 minutes (yoga) = 510 minutes

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Jake buys 2 T-shirts, so the total cost of the T-shirts is 2 * $8 = $16. However, since there's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake only pays for one T-shirt at the full price and the other one at 50% off. So, the cost of the first T-shirt is $8 and the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

The original price of the shoes is $40, and Jake buys them at 40% off. The discount on the shoes is $40 * 0.4 = $16. So, the cost of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is the cost of the T-shirts plus the cost of the shoes, which is $12 + $24 = $36.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then find out how many holes Nate fills in per day. 

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled in per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes.

To find out how many days it takes to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled in per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested (16), so he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
- He gathered two more Petri dishes than requested (14), so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
- He gathered the correct number of beakers (7).
- The total number of items on the lab bench is 29.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

8 (test tubes) + 7 (beakers) + 16 (Petri dishes) + x (lost beakers) = 29

Combine the known quantities:
8 + 7 + 16 = 31

Now, subtract 31 from both sides of the equation to isolate x:
31 + x = 29
x = 29 - 31
x = -2

However, since we can't have a negative number of lost beakers, this means that Igor didn't lose any beakers. The correct interpretation is that the total number of items on the lab bench is the sum of the items he gathered and the items he lost. Since the total is 29 and the items he gathered are 8 + 7 + 16 = 31, the number of items he lost is 31 - 29 = 2. However, these 2 items are not beakers, but rather the test tubes he gathered. 

The correct answer is that Igor lost 2 test tubes."
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

1. Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa.
2. Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron.
3. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
4. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if Aaron runs 1 mile in x minutes, Vanessa will run 1 mile in 2x minutes. 

Given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes and he ran half the distance Vanessa did (since Vanessa ran twice as far), we can set up the equation:

x * 2 = 16 (since Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa did, but at twice the speed, it takes him the same amount of time to run half the distance Vanessa did)

Solving for x, we get:
x = 16 / 2
x = 8

Now that we know Aaron runs 1 mile in 8 minutes, we can find out how long it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile:
Vanessa runs 1 mile in 2x = 2 * 8 = 16 minutes

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, we multiply the time it takes her to run 1 mile by 4:
16 * 4 = 64 minutes

"To find the cost of each watermelon, we first need to find the total selling price of all the watermelons. 

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. To find the selling price, we need to calculate the profit first. The profit is 25% of the cost price, which is $80. 

Profit = 25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20

The total selling price is the sum of the cost price and the profit. 

Total selling price = Cost price + Profit
Total selling price = $80 + $20
Total selling price = $100

Now, we can find the cost of each watermelon by dividing the total selling price by the number of watermelons.

Cost of each watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
Cost of each watermelon = $100 / 50
Cost of each watermelon = $2

"To find the total cost, first, calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. 

The original cost of the radiator is $400. 
The discount is 80% off, so the discount amount is 80% of $400, which is 0.8 * $400 = $320.
The cost of the radiator after the discount is $400 - $320 = $80.

Next, calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor. 
The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour, so the labor cost is 3 * $50 = $150.

"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so C + W = 20.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. So, the total number of legs can be expressed as 2C + 4W = 70.

We can solve the first equation for W: W = 20 - C.

Now, substitute W in the second equation: 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.

Expand the equation: 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.

Combine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.

Divide both sides by -2: C = 5.
