"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

Now, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. 

So, she makes 9 * 2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we need half of 2, which is 1 bolt of white fiber.

So, the total number of bolts needed is 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts. 

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we need to first find the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

Let's find the value of the increase: 
150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000

Now, we add the increase to the original value: 
$80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

So, the total value of the house after the repairs is $200,000. 

To find the profit, we subtract the original cost of the house and the repairs from the total value: 
$200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000

The profit Josh made is $70,000.

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total number of meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sprint sessions he does in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James does this 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals. 

In the morning, she gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. 
In the afternoon, she gives her chickens 25 cups of feed.

Total feed given in the morning and afternoon = 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Since Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, and she has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is:
Total feed per day = 3 cups/chicken * 20 chickens = 60 cups

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed per day:
Final meal feed = Total feed per day - Total feed given in the morning and afternoon
Final meal feed = 60 - 40
Final meal feed = 20 cups

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
The fourth glass costs 60% of $1.8, which is 0.6 * $1.8 = $1.08. 
We can see that the cost of each glass decreases by 40% (1 - 0.6 = 0.4) each time. 

The cost of the first glass is $5, the second is $3, the third is $1.8, the fourth is $1.08, the fifth is $0.64, the sixth is $0.384, the seventh is $0.2304, the eighth is $0.13824, the ninth is $0.082944, the tenth is $0.0497664, the eleventh is $0.02986584, the twelfth is $0.017949504, the thirteenth is $0.0107949304, the fourteenth is $0.00648696024, the fifteenth is $0.003876582144, the sixteenth is $0.002325949488.

Now, we add up the costs of all 16 glasses: 
$5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.64 + $0.384 + $0.2304 + $0.13824 + $0.082944 + $0.0497664 + $0.02986584 + $0.017949504 + $0.0107949304 + $0.00648696024 + $0.003876582144 + $0.002325949488 = $24.016

The total cost is $24.016."
"To find the number of sheep in Toulouse and Charleston, we need to first find the number of sheep in Charleston. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we add the number of sheep in each city: 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total time it takes Carla to download the file, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file:
40% of 200 GB is 0.4 x 200 = 80 GB
Time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute = 80 / 2 = 40 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file:
60% of 200 GB is 0.6 x 200 = 120 GB
Time to download 120 GB at 2 GB/minute = 120 / 2 = 60 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file:
40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled in the first 3 hours and the distance he traveled in the last 4 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time

For the first 3 hours, John drove at 60 mph:
Distance = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

For the first 2 hours of the return trip, John was stuck in traffic, so he didn't move:
Distance = 0 miles

For the next half-hour, John drove at 30 mph:
Distance = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

For the remaining 2.5 hours of the return trip, John drove at 80 mph:
Distance = 80 * 2.5 = 200 miles

Total distance traveled in the return trip = 15 + 200 = 215 miles

Since John was driving back home, we need to subtract the distance he traveled from home to the point where he turned around (180 miles) from the total distance he traveled in the return trip (215 miles) to find the distance he is from home at the end of the 4 hours:
Distance from home = 215 - 180 = 35 miles

The final answer is: 35"
"To find Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime pay rate is:
$10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

Her overtime earnings are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings for the week are:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads for each month together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, we add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total revenue it generates each year.

The initial cost of the tree is $90. 

Each year, the tree generates revenue from selling lemons. Since the tree grows 7 lemons per year and each lemon sells for $1.5, the total revenue per year is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

However, it also costs $3 to water and feed the tree each year. So, the net revenue per year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

To find out how many years it will take for the tree to start earning money, we need to find the break-even point, which is when the total revenue equals the initial cost of the tree.

Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. The total revenue after 'x' years is $7.5x, and the total cost is $90. We want to find the smallest 'x' for which $7.5x ≥ $90.

Dividing both sides by $7.5, we get x ≥ $90 / $7.5.

x ≥ 12

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, it will take 13 years for the tree to start earning money.

The final answer is: 13"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, which is x/3.

At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2.

We know that after all these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, let's first simplify the fraction (x - x/3 - 2)/2:

(x - x/3 - 2)/2 = (2x/3 - 2)/2 = (2x - 6)/6 = (x - 3)/3

Now, let's rewrite the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - 3)/3 = 5

To combine the fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 3. So, we can rewrite the equation as:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - 3)/3 = 5

x - x/3 - 2 - x/3 + 1 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2x/3 - 1 = 5

To get rid of the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:

3x - 2x - 3 = 15

x - 3 = 15

Add 3 to both sides:

x = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students

The remaining students after contemporary dance are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

The remaining students after jazz dance are 16 - 4 = 12 students.

The rest of the students, which is 12, enrolled in hip-hop dance.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the profit, we need to calculate the future value of each investment. 

The formula for future value is FV = PV * (1 + r), where PV is the present value and r is the rate of return.

For the jewelry, the future value would be $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125.

For the electronic gadgets, the future value would be $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096.

The profit from the jewelry would be $5,125 - $5,000 = $125.

The profit from the electronic gadgets would be $8,096 - $8,000 = $96.

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, the best choice would be the jewelry, which would result in a profit of $125."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. 

On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance.

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- Hourly wage: $20
- Hours worked per week: 35
- Weeks worked per year: 50
- Annual hours worked as a teacher: 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
- Annual earnings from teaching: 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- Hourly wage: $30
- Hours worked per week: 15
- Weeks worked per year: 50
- Annual hours worked as a coach: 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
- Annual earnings from coaching: 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
- Total annual salary: $35,000/year (teaching) + $22,500/year (coaching) = $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

In 4 weeks, she will eat 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat in 4 weeks.

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total time Marissa wants to take to complete the 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles, she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining 2 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can use the formula: speed = distance / time.

speed = 2 miles / 1 hour = 2 miles per hour

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. 

Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is 6.67 liters.

Now, to find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, we need to calculate three-fifths of 15 liters.

Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters.

Now, we need to add the amount of water from the orange and pineapple drinks and subtract the amount spilled.

Total water in both drinks = 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

Since 1 liter of the orange drink was spilled, we need to subtract 1 liter from the total water.

Remaining water = 15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters.

However, the question asks for the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture. To find this, we need to calculate the amount of water in the remaining 3 liters of the orange drink and the 15 liters of the pineapple drink.

The amount of water in the remaining 3 liters of the orange drink is (2/3) * 3 = 2 liters.

The amount of water in the remaining 15 liters of the pineapple drink is 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in the remaining orange and pineapple drinks.

Total water in the remaining 24 liters = 2 + 9 = 11 liters.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to first determine Raymond's current age. Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before her, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

Raymond had a son at the age of 23, so we need to find the difference between his current age and the age at which he had a son. 

25 (Raymond's current age) - 23 (age when he had a son) = 2 years.

However, we need to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born. Since Raymond's son is younger than him, we need to consider the time difference from the time Raymond had a son to the present.

Since Raymond is 25 now and had a son at 23, we need to find the difference between Samantha's age and the age of Raymond when he had a son. 

31 (Samantha's age) - 23 (age when Raymond had a son) = 8 years.

However, this is the time from when Raymond had a son to Samantha's current age. Since we want to know how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to subtract the time from when Raymond had a son to his current age from the time from when Raymond had a son to Samantha's current age.

8 (time from when Raymond had a son to Samantha's current age) - 2 (time from when Raymond had a son to his current age) = 6 years.

"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought a total of 3 DVDs.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought a total of 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so we don't need to add anything to the total.

Therefore, Billy sold a total of 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter, we need to calculate the total time it burns and multiply it by the rate at which it melts.

The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

The candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour. 

So, the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter is 4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price.

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since Kyle bought the book with a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of the original price, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so we can set up the equation:

x - 0.25x = 19.50

Combine like terms:

0.75x = 19.50

Now, divide both sides by 0.75 to solve for x:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she ordered excluding the pizza. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12. 
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15. 
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6. 

The total cost of the items excluding the pizza is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. 

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17. 

Now, we need to find out how many boxes of pizza cost $17. Each box costs $8.50, so the number of boxes is $17 / $8.50 = 2.

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will go through 60 servings in 60 days. 

Each carton has 15 servings, so to find out how many cartons she buys, we divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton: 
60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton to find the total cost:
4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

"To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles. 

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance from the first stop to the second stop = Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip - Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip
= 60 - 20
= 40 miles

However, this is the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. To find the distance between the first and second stops, we need to subtract the distance from the first stop to the second stop from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance between the first and second stops = Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip - Distance from the first stop to the second stop
= 40 - 25
= 15 miles

However, the distance from the first stop to the second stop is actually 25 miles. To find the distance between the first and second stops, we need to subtract the distance from the first stop to the second stop from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance between the first and second stops = Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip - Distance from the first stop to the second stop
= 60 - 25

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let the cost of the cheaper pair of heels be x dollars. 
The cost of the more expensive pair of heels is 2x dollars. 
The total cost of the two pairs of heels is 5 dollars less than the boots, so we can write the equation: x + 2x = boots - 5. 
Combine like terms: 3x = boots - 5. 
We also know that one pair of heels costs $33, so we can set up the equation x = 33. 
Now we can substitute x into the previous equation: 3(33) = boots - 5. 
Simplify the equation: 99 = boots - 5. 
Add 5 to both sides of the equation: 104 = boots.

The final answer is: 104"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x, where x is a constant.
2. The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162, so we can write the equation: 7x + 11x = 162
3. Combine like terms: 18x = 162
4. Divide both sides by 18: x = 9
5. Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age: Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99
6. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age: Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second person guesses 20 more than half of 80, which is (80 / 2) + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60.
The third person guesses 25% more than 80, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 80 + 20 = 100.

The total number of guesses is 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.
There are 3 people.

The average guess is 240 / 3 = 80.

"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog. 

Number of dogs: 10
Time spent on each dog: 0.5 hours

Total time spent per day = Number of dogs * Time spent on each dog
Total time spent per day = 10 * 0.5
Total time spent per day = 5 hours

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the total time spent per day by 7 to find the total time spent in a week.

Total time spent per week = Total time spent per day * 7
Total time spent per week = 5 * 7
Total time spent per week = 35 hours

"To find the number of gold coins, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We know that G = S + 30 (since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins) and G + S = 110 (since Gretchen has a total of 110 coins).

We can substitute the first equation into the second one: S + 30 + S = 110. Combining like terms, we get 2S + 30 = 110. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2S = 80. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the first equation: G = 40 + 30 = 70.

"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes. 

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. 

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. 25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point. So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

To find the total points, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first calculate how many yogurts he eats in 30 days and then find out the cost of those yogurts.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys in 30 days. To do this, we divide the total number of yogurts he eats by 4: 60 / 4 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of sets by the cost per set: 15 * $5.00 = $75.00.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many Lego sets John sold, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = $195.

Next, we need to find out how much money he spent on video games. He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so the total amount of money he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

Since he had $5 left after buying the video games, we can find out how much money he had before buying the video games by adding the money he had left to the money he spent on video games. So, he had $160 + $5 = $165 before buying the video games.

Now, we can find out how much money he made from selling the Lego sets by subtracting the money he had before buying the video games from the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets. However, we can also find out how much money he made from selling the Lego sets by subtracting the money he spent on video games from the money he had after buying the video games. Since both methods should give the same result, we can use either one. 

Using the first method, we get $195 - $165 = $30. Using the second method, we get $165 + $5 = $170, and then $170 - $160 = $10. However, the first method is correct, and the second method is incorrect. 

Since the first method is correct, we can find out how many Lego sets John sold by dividing the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets by the price of each Lego set. So, he sold 13 - (195 / 15) = 13 - 13 = 0 Lego sets."
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his total running time per week and then divide the total distance by that time.

John runs 3 hours the first day, and half as much on the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. So, he runs 1.5 hours on each of the other two days.

Total running time per week = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day)
Total running time per week = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5
Total running time per week = 6 hours

Now, we know John runs 60 miles in 6 hours. To find out his speed, we need to divide the total distance by the total time.

Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running and walking speeds. 

Given that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, we can find her running speed by multiplying her skipping speed by 2. 

Running speed = 2 * Skipping speed
Running speed = 2 * 3
Running speed = 6 miles per hour

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4.

Walking speed = Running speed / 4
Walking speed = 6 / 4
Walking speed = 1.5 miles per hour

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, in 6 hours, she will spend 2 hours running and 4 hours walking.

Distance traveled while running = Speed * Time
Distance traveled while running = 6 * 2
Distance traveled while running = 12 miles

Distance traveled while walking = Speed * Time
Distance traveled while walking = 1.5 * 4
Distance traveled while walking = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance traveled while running + Distance traveled while walking
Total distance traveled = 12 + 6
Total distance traveled = 18 miles

"To find the distance Polly can stand outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon, we need to calculate the distance the javelin can travel when Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone.

When Polly is not holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin 400 feet. When she is holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther, so the distance is 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1000 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the javelin. However, we need to find the distance outside the dragon's reach. 

The distance outside the dragon's reach is the distance the javelin can travel minus the distance the dragon's flames reach, which is 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

"To find out how many calories you can still consume, subtract the calories you've already consumed from your daily target: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, multiply the number of servings you can still consume by the total weight of the bag: 0.8 * 300 = 240 grams.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total cost. Since Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for 10 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks for 20 candles (2 sets of 10 candles). The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Next, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles, so the total revenue is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Now, let's find the net profit. The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Total number of articles written in 3 days = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since it takes 4 hours to write one article, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to first determine how many Post-it notes she used in total. 

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work. To find the total number of Post-it notes she used, we add 80 and 220: 80 + 220 = 300. 

Since she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, we need to subtract 23 from the total number of Post-it notes she used to find out how many she purchased: 300 - 23 = 277.

The final answer is: 277"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many blue ties John bought. Since he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost per tie to find the number of blue ties.

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

Now, we need to find the cost of each red tie. Since the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we can calculate the cost of each red tie as follows:

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on all ties by adding the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on all ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"

"To find the total time Tom spent traveling, we need to calculate the time he spent traveling from 1 to 4 PM and then add the time it takes him to travel back.

First, let's find the distance Tom traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he traveled at 10 miles per hour, we can use the formula: distance = speed * time. However, we don't know the time he spent traveling from 1 to 4 PM. We know that 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours, but we need to find the distance he traveled in that time.

Since we know the speed (10 mph) and the time (3 hours), we can find the distance: distance = 10 * 3 = 30 miles.

Now, let's find the time it takes him to travel back. We know the distance (30 miles) and the speed (6 mph). We can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

time = 30 / 6 = 5 hours.

So, the total time Tom spent traveling is 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM) + 5 hours (back) = 8 hours.

"To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the total weight of the comic books he removed. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removed 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books already removed weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, to find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

"To find the revenue earned on Thursday, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately and then add them together. 

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday: 6 truck tires * $60 per tire = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday: 4 car tires * $40 per tire = $160
Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

To find the revenue earned on Friday, we need to calculate the revenue from car tires only since no truck tires were repaired.

Revenue from car tires on Friday: 12 car tires * $40 per tire = $480

Now, we need to compare the revenues of Thursday and Friday to find the day with higher revenue. 

Thursday's revenue: $520
Friday's revenue: $480

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 

To find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the revenue of the day with lower revenue from the revenue of the day with higher revenue.

$520 (Thursday's revenue) - $480 (Friday's revenue) = $40

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

Now, let's find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
= 200 - 100
= 100

"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package. 

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 
18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages of 2 flowers.
9 packages of 2 flowers * $1 per package = $9.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the package of 3 flowers.
18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages of 3 flowers.
6 packages of 3 flowers * $2.50 per package = $15.

The difference in cost is $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

Original price: $100
Discount percentage: 30%

Discount amount = 30% of $100 = 0.30 * $100 = $30

Cost after discount = Original price - Discount amount
= $100 - $30

The final answer is: $70"
"To find out how much water the girls got, we need to calculate 1/6 of 24 liters. 

1/6 of 24 liters = 24 / 6 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, they each got 4 liters, so together they got 8 liters. 

Now, we subtract the total amount of water the girls got from the initial 24 liters. 

24 - 8 = 16 liters

Then, we subtract the 6 liters the boy got from the remaining 16 liters.

16 - 6 = 10 liters

So, 10 liters of water were left.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he received and then subtract the number of stickers he gave away and used.

Charlie initially had 10 stickers. He bought 21 stickers and got 23 stickers for his birthday, so the total number of stickers he received is:
10 (initial stickers) + 21 (bought stickers) + 23 (birthday stickers) = 54 stickers

Now, Charlie gave away 9 stickers and used 28 stickers, so the total number of stickers he lost is:
9 (given away) + 28 (used) = 37 stickers

To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we subtract the number of stickers he lost from the total number of stickers he received:
54 (total stickers received) - 37 (stickers lost) = 17

The final answer is: 17"
"To find Alex's weight, we need to calculate 4 times Grace's weight and then subtract 2 pounds from it. 

4 times Grace's weight is 4 * 125 = 500 pounds. 
Alex's weight is 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now, to find their combined weight, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight: 
125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

The total number of thorns is 600."
"To find the number of games the team won, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of games they lost is x. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

Since x is the number of games lost, the number of games won is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time it went off and add them up.

The first time it went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add up the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after the 5th year and then calculate the increase for the next three years.

Initial salary: $600
Increase: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 5 years: $600 + $60 = $660

Now, we need to calculate the increase for the next three years. Since the increase is 10% of the current salary, we will apply this increase to the salary after 5 years.

Salary after 6 years: $660 + (10% of $660) = $660 + 0.1 * $660 = $660 + $66 = $726
Salary after 7 years: $726 + (10% of $726) = $726 + 0.1 * $726 = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60
Salary after 8 years: $798.60 + (10% of $798.60) = $798.60 + 0.1 * $798.60 = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $878.46."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as H. Since Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10H.

We know that the total number of copies sold is 88,000, so we can set up the equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

16 (invited guests) - (1/4 * 16) = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of guests who will attend by 0.75.

12 (guests) * 0.75 (gift bags per guest) = 9

Now, we multiply the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag to find the total cost.

9 (gift bags) * $2 (cost per gift bag) = $18

"To find Gerald's original time, we need to add 2 seconds to Lee's time, since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald. 

Lee's time is 38 seconds, so Gerald's original time is 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so we need to find 10% of 40 and add it to 40.

10% of 40 is 0.1 * 40 = 4.

Gerald's new time is 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
2. There are two cats for every dog.
3. The number of dogs is 60.

Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, the number of cats can be calculated as follows:
Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know the number of dogs (60) and the number of cats (120). The combined number of dogs and cats is:
Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

According to the first point, the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats:
Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
= 60 + 120 + 168
= 348

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we first need to determine the total volume of the tomatoes before they were cooked. Since the sauce lost half its volume, the original volume of the sauce must have been 32 * 2 = 64 ounces.

Since each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes, we can find the total number of cans used by dividing the original volume of the sauce by the volume of each can: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Since each can contains three tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is 4 * 3 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to first determine the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. 

We know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. 

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as x. 

Since 5 cars took an exit, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the original number of cars minus the cars that took an exit: 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes: x + 20 = 25.

Now, we can solve for x: x = 25 - 20
x = 5

First, we need to find out how many 3-mile sections are in 42 miles. We can do this by dividing 42 by 3.

42 miles / 3 miles per section = 14 sections

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile section, we multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section.

14 sections * 10 minutes per section = 140 minutes

"To find the inner volume of one box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the dimensions of the box. 

The length of the inner box is 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side).
The width of the inner box is 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side).
The height of the inner box is 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side).

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the length, width, and height: 
Inner volume of one box = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year.
2. He baked 15 more cookies than he meant to.
3. He dropped 5 cookies, and now has a total of 110 cookies.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as 'x'. Since he wants to make twice as many this year, he intended to bake 2x cookies.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the total number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. This can be represented as:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

From point 1, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

From point 2, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Since Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs, we can set up the equation:

300 = 50 * x

where x is the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 50:

x = 300 / 50
x = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total selling price of the lumber.

The total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100.
The total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80.
The total cost of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each.
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

The total selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $15 = $150.
The total selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $24 = $120.
The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Lylah's salary four years ago. 

Let's assume Lylah's salary four years ago was x. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can write an equation:

Adrien's salary = 1.3x

We know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, so we can set up the equation:

1.3x = 40000

To find x, we can divide both sides by 1.3:

x = 40000 / 1.3
x = 30769.23

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30769.23.

Now, we need to find Adrien's salary four years later. We know that his salary increased by 40%:

Adrien's new salary = 1.4 * 40000
Adrien's new salary = 56000

We also need to find Lylah's new salary. Since her salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, we can multiply her old salary by 1.4:

Lylah's new salary = 1.4 * 30769.23
Lylah's new salary = 43055.72

Now, we can find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = 56000 + 43055.72
Total salary = 99055.72

"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to first calculate how many sheets he uses in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, he uses 2 x 30 = 60 sheets of paper a week.

There are approximately 4 weeks in a month. To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses in a month, we multiply the number of sheets he uses in a week by the number of weeks in a month: 60 x 4 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then add them together.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 
Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples.
Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

So, Morisette brought 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.
Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

The total number of fruits they have is 13 + 14 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to break down her sleep pattern.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

There are 5 days in the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), so the total hours she slept in those days is 5 * 7 = 35 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept throughout the week:

Monday: 8 hours
Tuesday and Wednesday: 2 * 6 = 12 hours
Thursday to Sunday: 35 hours
Total hours = 8 + 12 + 35 = 55 hours

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours:
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Next, let's calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distances together to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:
Total distance = Distance at 10 miles per hour + Distance at 5 miles per hour
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to figure out how many letters Jennie added to the pile. 

Since Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, she added one-third of 60 letters to the pile. 

One-third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20.

So, Jennie added 20 letters to the pile of already-stamped letters. 

Since there are now 30 letters in the pile, we can subtract 20 from 30 to find out how many letters were in the pile when Jennie began.

30 - 20 = 10

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many spoons were in the package that Julia bought, we need to subtract the total number of spoons she had at the end (12) from the number of spoons she had after her husband gave her the new spoons (12 + 5 = 17) and then add back the 3 spoons she used. 

First, we add the 5 spoons her husband gave her to the total number of spoons she had at the end: 12 + 5 = 17. 
Then, we subtract the 3 spoons she used: 17 - 3 = 14. 
However, this is the total number of spoons she had after her husband gave her the new spoons, so we need to subtract the 5 spoons her husband gave her to find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought: 14 - 5 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages. 

Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 
He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

To find the total number of sausages, we add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages: 38 + 44 = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we need to add the number of friends Lily has to the number of friends Amy has. 

Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily has 50 friends, Amy has 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

Now, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to determine the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity.

1. The cost of each pepper is given as $15.
2. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, so the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.
3. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each item:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To find the total time spent by doctors, we need to multiply the number of patients by the average time spent per patient. 

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total minutes to hours.

12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The hospital pays the doctors $150/hour, so the total cost is:

200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

The hospital charges the patients $200/hour, so the total revenue is:

200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

The profit is the difference between the revenue and the cost:

$40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits.

$10,000"
"To find the number of elves left, we first need to calculate the number of elves who quit after the children vomit on them. A third of the 60 elves quit, so we divide 60 by 3 to get 20. 

60 / 3 = 20

Now, we subtract 20 from the original 60 to find the number of elves left after the first incident. 

60 - 20 = 40

Then, 10 more elves quit after kids kick their shins. We subtract 10 from the remaining 40 to find the final number of elves left.

40 - 10 = 30

The final number of elves left is 30."
"To find the total expenditure for the two months, we need to add the expenditure in May and June. 

In May, Joseph's expenditure was $500. 
In June, his expenditure was $60 less than May, so it was $500 - $60 = $440.

Now, we add the expenditure for both months: $500 + $440 = $940.

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides each person took and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she rode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides is 4 (Pam's rides) + 6 (Fred's rides) = 10 rides.

Each ride costs 6 tickets, so the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first determine how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is 6 * 4 = 24 miles.

Now, we know that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We already know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. 

So, the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles. 

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage for the three days: 41 - 28 = 13 miles.

"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we first need to determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially has 20 video games but lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. To find out how many video games Bobby has, we multiply Brian's remaining video games by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 times Brian's remaining video games is 3 * 15 = 45.

5 fewer than 45 is 45 - 5 = 40.

"To find the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to calculate the cost of the items, add the delivery fee, and then add the tip.

1. Calculate the cost of the items:
   - 2 subs for $7.50 each: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
   - 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
   - 2 cookies for $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
   - Total cost of items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

2. Add the delivery fee (20% of the total cost of items):
   - Delivery fee: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

"To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate how many questions he completed in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

First, we find out how many questions he completed in 8 hours: 8 hours * 5 questions/hour = 40 questions.

Since he completed 40 questions in 8 hours, he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete in the first test.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.

We find out how many questions he completed in 6 hours: 6 hours * 5 questions/hour = 30 questions.

Since he completed 30 questions in 6 hours, he left 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete in the second test.

To find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests: 35 + 70 = 105.

"To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we need to subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars. 

Total number of cars = 20
Number of automatic cars = 12
Number of manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100

"Let's break down the information given:

- Let the number of baby bees be x.
- Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2x.
- There are twice as many babies as queens, so the number of queens is x/2.
- The total number of bees is 700, which is the sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens: 2x + x + x/2 = 700.

To solve for x, we need to combine like terms and isolate x:
2x + x + x/2 = 700
Combine like terms: 2.5x = 700
Divide both sides by 2.5: x = 700 / 2.5
x = 280

Now that we know the number of baby bees (x) is 280, we can find the number of worker bees:
Number of worker bees = 2x = 2 * 280 = 560

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day, if he spent that time working instead, he would work 2 hours a day.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours he would work in a week is:
2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week

Now, we multiply the total hours he would work in a week by his hourly wage:
14 hours/week * $10/hour = $140/week

Total cost of food items: 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
Total cost of non-food items: 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
Tax = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax to the cost of non-food items:
Total cost of non-food items with tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax:
Total cost = 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.
3. The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is 30 (initially left) + 15 (returned) = 45 bees. However, 15 bees returned, so the number of bees that have not returned is 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees leave the hive. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave the hive.
5. The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is 30 (initially left) + 60 (left in the next 6 hours) = 90 bees. However, 15 bees returned in the previous 6 hours, and 15 bees returned in the last 6 hours, so the number of bees that have not returned is 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees, and 60 (left in the next 6 hours) - 15 (returned) = 45 bees. 
6. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. So, 15 (initially left and not returned) + 45 (left in the next 6 hours and not returned) = 60 bees return to the hive.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy.
- James has four times as many friends as Dorothy.
- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook.

Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can set up an equation to find out how many friends Dorothy has. Let's call the number of friends Dorothy has ""x"". Then, Charlie has 3x friends.

We know Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation: 3x = 12

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 12 / 3
x = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook.

Now, we know James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, James has 4 * 4 = 16 friends on Facebook.

"To find out who will win the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

Steve's distance is 3 miles, which is 5280 feet (since 1 mile = 5280 feet). His speed is 440 feet per minute. 

Time taken by Steve to get home = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Steve to get home = 5280 / 440
Time taken by Steve to get home = 12 minutes

Tim's distance is 2 miles, which is 10560 feet (since 1 mile = 5280 feet). His speed is 264 feet per minute.

Time taken by Tim to get home = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Tim to get home = 10560 / 264
Time taken by Tim to get home = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 12 minutes to get home and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will win the race. 

To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the time taken by the winner from the time taken by the loser.

Time taken by the winner (Steve) = 12 minutes
Time taken by the loser (Tim) = 40 minutes

Time the winner will be waiting = Time taken by the loser - Time taken by the winner
Time the winner will be waiting = 40 - 12

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and 5 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * 25 cents = $2.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and 3 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * 25 cents = $2.25.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and 1 person came by to get their tire inflated. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1.

The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * 25 cents = $0.25.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total eaten is 14 (by Dave) + 7 (by seagull) = 21 french fries.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.
   Now, the total eaten is 21 + 9 = 30 french fries.
4. A raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's denote the total number of fries initially as x. 
   After the pigeons ate, (x - 30) fries were left. The raccoon ate 2/3 of (x - 30), which is (2/3)(x - 30).
   The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30).
   We can simplify this expression: (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30) = (1/3)(x - 30).
5. After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. 
   So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.
   To solve for x, we need to isolate x: 
   (1/3)(x - 30) = 6
   Multiply both sides by 3: x - 30 = 18
   Add 30 to both sides: x = 48

"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total amount Raphael spent, we need to calculate the cost of the pens, the cost of the notebooks, and the cost of the bond paper, then add them together.

The cost of the pens is 4 * $1.5 = $6.
The cost of the notebooks is 2 * $4 = $8.
The cost of the bond paper is $20.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"Finn initially sees 11 tadpoles. 6 more tadpoles come out of hiding, so he now sees 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles. Then, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so he can no longer see them. To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see now, we subtract the 2 that hid from the total of 17. 

17 - 2 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the depth of the water on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.
On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = (24 * 2) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total number of fish caught by Locsin, we need to calculate the number of each type of fish he caught. 

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, we can find the total number of fish caught by Locsin: 5 (starfish) + 3 (sea horses) + 5 (clownfish) = 13 fish.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish, so the total number of fish he caught is 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.

The total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin is 19 (Anakin's fish) + 13 (Locsin's fish) = 32 fish.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the cost of the marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price.

Initial price = $20
Increase rate = 20% of the original price = 0.20 * $20 = $4
Price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24
Increase rate after 2 months = 20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80
Price after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80
Increase rate after 4 months = 20% of $28.80 = 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76
Price after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56
Increase rate after 6 months = 20% of $34.56 = 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.912
Price after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.912 = $41.472
Increase rate after 8 months = 20% of $41.472 = 0.20 * $41.472 = $8.2944
Price after 10 months = $41.472 + $8.2944 = $49.7664

"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then add them together.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5. So, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

One red car costs $4. There are 5 red cars, so the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

The total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we add the cost of the doll, the red cars, and the action figures together: $15 (doll) + $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) = $50.

The total worth of all the toys is $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself:

Income lost = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the income she'll lose:

Difference = Income lost - Cost of accountant
= $105 - $90
= $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We are given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation:

S = 2B

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, we can write another equation:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the second equation, we get:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to first determine what ""twice the money Ethel has"" is. Since Ethel has $8, twice that amount would be 2 * 8 = 16.

"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks in a week, considering both weekdays and weekends.

There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week. 

On weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles a day, so the total miles walked on weekdays is 5 * 20 = 100 miles.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles a day, so the total miles walked on weekends is 2 * 10 = 20 miles.

The total miles walked in a week is the sum of the miles walked on weekdays and weekends, which is 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The hat costs $25.

The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.

The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

1. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
2. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
3. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo.
4. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.

From point 3, we know Sally Four is 8 years old. 
From point 2, we know Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.
From point 1, we know Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of three birds: Sally Four (8), Granny Red (16), and Sally Two (19). 
The only bird left is the one at the Caboose, which is Sally, but we don't know which Sally. However, since Sally Two and Sally Four are already accounted for, the only other Sally left is Sally Thirtytwo, which we already know is 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much they made in total from selling lemonade and then subtract the cost of sugar to find the cost of lemons.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the total revenue per gallon is:
   20 glasses/gallon * $0.50/glass = $10/gallon

2. They made a profit of $25, so their total revenue is:
   Total revenue = Profit + Cost
   Total revenue = $25 + Cost

3. Since we know the total revenue per gallon is $10, we can set up an equation to find the total number of gallons sold:
   Total revenue = Total revenue per gallon * Number of gallons
   $25 + Cost = $10 * Number of gallons

4. However, we don't know the cost yet, so let's express the cost in terms of lemons and sugar:
   Cost = Cost of lemons + Cost of sugar
   Cost = 3x + 2x (where x is the number of gallons)

5. Substitute the cost expression into the equation:
   $25 + 3x + 2x = $10 * Number of gallons

6. Since we know that the total revenue per gallon is $10, we can set up another equation:
   $10 = $10 * Number of gallons
   Number of gallons = 1

7. Now we can substitute the number of gallons into the equation:
   $25 + 3x + 2x = $10 * 1
   $25 + 5x = $10

8. Solve for x:
   5x = $10 - $25
   5x = -$15
   x = -$15 / 5
   x = -3 (this is not possible since we can't have a negative number of gallons, so let's re-evaluate the problem)

"To find the number of Chinese participants, we first need to subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants. 

Total participants = 240
Japanese participants = 80
Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Now, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team was 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls on the Chinese team = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 160 - 60
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 100

"To find out how much money Zaid has left after all expenses and donations, we need to follow the order of operations.

1. Zaid earns 6000$ per month.
2. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent: 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$
3. He spends 1/3 on car fuel: 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$
4. Total expenses so far: 1500 + 2000 = 3500$
5. Remaining amount after rent and car fuel: 6000 - 3500 = 2500$
6. He donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity: 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$
7. Remaining amount after donation: 2500 - 1250 = 1250$
8. He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$: 200 + 700 = 900$
9. Total expenses for his daughter and wife: 900$
10. Remaining amount after expenses for his daughter and wife: 1250 - 900 = 350$

"To find the total number of crabs, we first need to determine the number of crabs each person has. 

Bo has 40 crabs. 
Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs. 
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we add the number of crabs each person has to find the total: 
40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122

"To find out how much Lloyd earned in the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd tutored 5 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the first week are:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

For the second week, Lloyd tutored 8 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the second week are:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, we add his earnings for the first and second weeks together:
$50 + $80 = $130

"To find the number of votes the winner got, we need to calculate 3/4 of the total number of students who voted. 

3/4 * 80 = 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, and the winner got 60 votes, the loser must have got the remaining votes. 

Total votes - Winner's votes = Loser's votes
80 - 60 = 20

The loser got 20 votes."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of white carnations first. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and there are 200 pink calla lilies. 

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Then, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x, and we know that 5x = 200. 

To find 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5: 
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. We know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of red roses as 'y'. Then, y = 4x, and we know that x = 40. 
y = 4 * 40
y = 160

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business. 

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 2, we can write an equation to represent the situation two years ago:

Mark's age two years ago = (1/2) * Jan's age two years ago + 5

Since Jan is 30 now, two years ago Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Mark's age two years ago = (1/2) * 28 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 14 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 19

Now, we know Mark's age two years ago was 19. To find Mark's current age, we add 2 years:

Mark's current age = 19 + 2
Mark's current age = 21

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's age:

Jean's age = Mark's age + 2
Jean's age = 21 + 2
Jean's age = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the total time for the well-rounded team and the less well-rounded team.

The well-rounded team's total time is 4 * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To find the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3, we need to consider the favorable outcomes (4, 5, or 6) out of the total possible outcomes (1 to 6). 

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 or 50%.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to consider the favorable outcomes (2, 2, 4, 4, 6, 6) out of the total possible outcomes (6 * 6 = 36). 

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 6/36 = 1/6 or approximately 16.67%.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 50% - 16.67% = 33.33%.

So, Jerry is 33.33% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: 33.33"
"To find out how many apples Jenna picked, we need to find half of the number of apples her mom picked. Since her mom picked 20 apples, Jenna picked half of that, which is 20 / 2 = 10 apples.

So, Jenna picked 10 apples and her mom picked 20 apples. To find the total number of apples they both picked, we add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mom picked: 10 + 20 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the number of rats in each cage, we first need to determine the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters) and the total amount of straw used by them. 

Since there are 3 cages of rats and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the total straw used by rats is 6x, where x is the number of rats in each cage. 

There are 10 cages of hamsters, each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, so the total straw used by hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The total straw used by small rodents is 160, and the total straw used by hamsters is 50. So, the straw used by rats is 160 - 50 = 110.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the total number of rats is 110 / 6 = 18.33. However, since the number of rats must be a whole number, we can assume that the number of rats is a multiple of 3 (as they are kept in groups of 3 cages). 

The closest multiple of 3 to 18.33 is 18. So, there are 18 rats in total. 

Since there are 3 cages of rats, the number of rats in each cage is 18 / 3 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The initial amount owed is $100.
The monthly interest rate is 2% or 0.02.

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

The total interest is $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

The total amount Mandy should pay is the initial amount plus the total interest: $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

Rounding to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to first calculate the total cost and total revenue.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $400. So, we can set up the equation:

$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$8x = $400

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:

x = $400 / $8
x = 50

So, the trader sold 50 bags."
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he collects peaches and then multiply it by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we know John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the total minutes by the peaches collected per minute:

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks needs per day, we first need to find out how many pounds of insects they need per week. Since there are 10 ducks and each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we multiply the number of ducks by the amount of insects each duck needs per week.

10 ducks * 3.5 pounds/duck/week = 35 pounds/week

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total amount of insects needed per week by 7 to find out how many pounds of insects the flock needs per day.

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

"To find the total number of trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees over 10 years, then subtract the trees that die.

Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net change in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8.

Over 10 years, the net change is 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

Tom starts with 50 trees, so after 10 years, he has 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 * 0.3 = 39.

So, the number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find the number of pink and white flamingos, we need to break down the events step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, there are now 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is now 12 + 18 = 30.

The total number of white flamingos remains 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

"To find out how many crayons Violetta can buy, we need to divide the amount of money she has by the cost of one crayon. 

Number of crayons = Total money / Cost of one crayon
Number of crayons = $20 / $2
Number of crayons = 10

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color. 

Total number of crayons she can buy = 2 * 5
Total number of crayons she can buy = 10

Since she can buy 10 crayons and she needs 5 different colors, she will buy 2 of each color. 

Now, let's calculate the change she will get. 

Change = Total money - Total cost of crayons
Change = $20 - (2 * 5)
Change = $20 - $10
Change = $10

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to calculate his new salary after the 5% raise and then multiply it by the number of weeks he works in a year.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his current salary:
5% of $2000 = 0.05 * $2000 = $100
New salary = $2000 + $100 = $2100

Since John works every week of the year, there are 52 weeks in a year. 

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the year:
Total earnings = New salary * Number of weeks
Total earnings = $2100 * 52
Total earnings = $109,200

Additionally, John received a one-time monetary reward of $5000 for the award.

Total earnings for the year = $109,200 + $5000

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish.

For sandwiches, Carl ate 7 days' worth of sandwiches (since it's a week) with 2 slices per sandwich. So, the total slices used for sandwiches = 7 * 2 = 14.

For omelets, Carl ate 3 days' worth of omelets with 3 slices per omelet (since he used one more slice per omelet than per sandwich). So, the total slices used for omelets = 3 * 3 = 9.

For the macaroni and cheese dish, Carl used 8 slices.

Now, let's add up the total slices used: 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31.

Next, we add up the scores of the first five tests: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338.

Now, we subtract the sum of the first five tests from the total score needed: 558 - 338 = 220.

This means Brinley needs a score of 220 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To find the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike, we need to calculate the total kilometers for the first four weeks and the total kilometers for the next three weeks, and then add them together.

In the first four weeks, Michael rode his bike 5 times a week for 4 weeks. So, the total number of times he rode his bike in the first four weeks is 5 * 4 = 20 times. Since he rode 25 kilometers each time, the total kilometers in the first four weeks is 20 * 25 = 500 kilometers.

In the next three weeks, Michael rode his bike 2 times a week for 3 weeks. So, the total number of times he rode his bike in the next three weeks is 2 * 3 = 6 times. Since he rode 60 kilometers each time, the total kilometers in the next three weeks is 6 * 60 = 360 kilometers.

Now, we add the total kilometers for the first four weeks and the next three weeks: 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

The final answer is: 860"
"To find the total weight of the chocolate bars, we need to multiply the number of chocolate bars by their weight. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

To find the weight of the candied apples, we need to know the weight of one candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of one candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g. The total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

The total weight of the bag of candy is the sum of the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The final answer is: 2600"
"To find the total number of cakes Rose bought, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and add them together.

On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.
On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

The final answer is: 76"
"To find the total cost of buying each cup, we first need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. 

Half a dozen plates cost $6000 each, so the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36000.

We are told that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

Since twenty dozen cups is equal to 240 cups, the cost of each cup is $34800 / 240 = $145.

The final answer is: $145"
"To find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs to earn and subtract the amount she already has.

The total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is $30 + $20 * 2 = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn. 

Let's calculate how much more money she needs to earn: $70 - $10 = $60.

Now, let's calculate how much she earns from babysitting: $5 * 4 = $20.

The amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn is $60 - $20 = $40.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can divide the amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn by the amount she earns per mowing: $40 / $4 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We know that W = R + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can set up the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers she counted on the first two days. 

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. 
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers on the first two days is x + (x + 50) = 2x + 50.

We know that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. Since the number of customers on the third day is included in this total, we can set up the equation: 2x + 50 + y = 500, where y is the number of customers on the third day.

However, we are asked to find the number of customers on the third day, so we can simplify the equation by subtracting 2x + 50 from both sides: y = 500 - (2x + 50).

We are also given that Sloane counted 100 customers on the first day, so x = 100. 

Now we can substitute x = 100 into the equation: y = 500 - (2(100) + 50) = 500 - 200 = 300.

However, this is the total for the first two days, not the third day. We know that the total for the first two days is 250, and the total for all three days is 500. So the number of customers on the third day is 500 - 250 = 250.

The final answer is: 250"
"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of water loss for both pools is 8 gallons/minute in total.

In 4 minutes, the total water lost from both pools is 8 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 32 gallons.

The big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y'. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y.

We know that the initial amount of water in the big pool (2x) minus the water lost (32 gallons) is equal to the current amount of water in the big pool (4y). So, we can write the equation:

2x - 32 = 4y

We also know that the initial amount of water in the small pool (x) minus the water lost (32 gallons) is equal to the current amount of water in the small pool (y). So, we can write the equation:

x - 32 = y

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for x:

2(x - 32) - 32 = 4y
2x - 64 - 32 = 4y
2x - 96 = 4y

Now, substitute y = x - 32 into the equation:

2x - 96 = 4(x - 32)
2x - 96 = 4x - 128
-96 + 128 = 4x - 2x
32 = 2x
x = 16

Now that we know x, we can find y:

y = 16 - 32
y = -16

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn, which is the cost of the shoes and the belt. 

Total cost = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Since Lori earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours to work = 44 hours

"To find the total amount Janeth will pay, we need to calculate the total interest she will pay over 12 months. 

First, let's find the interest she will pay each month. 10% of $2000 is 0.1 x $2000 = $200. 

Since she will pay $165 a month, the remaining amount after paying the interest is $165 - $200 = -$35. However, this is not possible as she cannot pay less than the interest. This means that she will not be able to pay the interest in full each month.

Let's recalculate the interest she will pay over 12 months. The total interest she will pay is $200 per month for 12 months, which is $200 x 12 = $2400.

Now, let's find the total amount she will pay over 12 months. The total amount is the initial amount plus the interest, which is $2000 + $2400 = $4400.

Since she will pay $165 a month for 12 months, the total amount she will pay is $165 x 12 = $1980.

Now, let's find the remaining balance. The remaining balance is the total amount she will pay minus the initial amount, which is $1980 - $2000 = -$20. However, this is not possible as she cannot have a negative balance.

This means that Janeth will not be able to pay the interest in full over 12 months. However, if we assume that she will pay the interest in full over 12 months, the remaining balance will be -$20.

However, if we consider the situation practically, she will still owe $2000 + $2400 - $1980 = $440 - $1980 = $440."

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). 

In three years, their ages will be: 
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, which is 68 + 17 = 85.

Now we know that Naomi scored 68 points, Yuri scored 44 points, and Brianna scored 85 points. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points scored by the four students. 

Total points scored by the four students = 251
Points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197

Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. So, the amount of rainwater collected is 2 times the amount of water left in the tank.

Rainwater collected = 2 * 30 = 60 liters

Now, we add the rainwater collected to the water left in the tank to find the total amount of water in the tank.

"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias. 

First, we know Andy plants 90 geraniums. 
Then, we know he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. So, the number of petunias is 90 - 40 = 50.

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias: 90 + 50 = 140.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the second year first. 

The company spent a third of $15000 in the second year. 
A third of $15000 is $15000 / 3 = $5000.

The total amount spent on advertising for the two years is the sum of the amount spent in the first year and the amount spent in the second year.
Total amount = $15000 + $5000 = $20000.

The final answer is: $20000"

"To find the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to calculate the time it takes for each leg of the trip and add them together.

The time it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus is 6 days.
The time it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car is half of 6 days, which is 6 / 2 = 3 days.

Since Andrew will travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car, we need to double the time it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car, as he will be making the same trip back. So, the total time for the car trip is 3 * 2 = 6 days.

The total time for the trip is the sum of the time it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and the time it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car and back by car. 
Total time = 6 (bus) + 6 (car) = 12 days.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we first need to find the total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type and buying 14 grass type. 

Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. 

After losing 8 water type, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.

After buying 14 grass type, he has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

The total number of cards James has is 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards.

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, which is 32/96.

To find the percentage, we multiply by 100: (32/96) * 100 = 33.333...

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is 33."
"To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito costs $6.50. 
He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. 
So, the total cost of the add-ons is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.
The total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the new total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.
He has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

"To find out how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to calculate their combined rate. 

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, which is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute. 

Their combined rate is 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate. 

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

"To find the number of melons not ready to be harvested after two weeks, we need to follow the steps below:

Initially, there were 120 watermelons.

After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. 
30% of 120 is 0.3 * 120 = 36. 
So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest, and 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons were not ready.

After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest. 
3/4 of 84 is 0.75 * 84 = 63. 
So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest, and 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons were not ready.

"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we first need to determine how many shells she collected on Monday. 

On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, so Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. To find out how many shells she collects on Tuesday, we multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2. 

25 * 2 = 50

So, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we first need to find the number of bugs. Since there are half as many bugs as ants, and there are 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = Number of ants / 2
Number of bugs = 50 / 2
Number of bugs = 25

Now, to find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and bugs:

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
Total number of insects = 50 + 25
Total number of insects = 75

"To find out how many penguins are left sunbathing, we need to calculate how many penguins jumped in the ocean and went inside the cave. 

One-third of the penguins jumped in the ocean, which is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins. 
Another one-third of the penguins went inside the cave, which is also 36 / 3 = 12 penguins.

In total, 12 + 12 = 24 penguins left the group of penguins sunbathing. 

To find out how many penguins are left sunbathing, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many vines Steve needs, we first need to determine how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply this by 7 to get the total tomatoes he eats per week.

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can assume his girlfriend eats half the amount he does. 

6 tomatoes/day / 2 = 3 tomatoes/day (girlfriend's consumption)

3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week (girlfriend's consumption per week)

Total tomatoes consumed per week = Steve's consumption + girlfriend's consumption
Total tomatoes/week = 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes/week

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide the total tomatoes consumed per week by the number of tomatoes per vine to find out how many vines are needed.

Total tomatoes/week / tomatoes per vine = 63 / 3 = 21 vines

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how many pizzas John needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of slices required and then divide it by the number of slices per pizza.

Total number of friends: 20
Number of slices per friend: 4

Number of slices per pizza: 8
Number of pizzas required: 80 / 8 = 10

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many new pens Ram can make from the ink of the 25 pens he buys. 

Since Ram can make one full pen from the ink of five empty pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens from the first 25 pens. 

Now, these 5 new pens will also run out of ink, and he can use their ink to make more pens. Since he can make one full pen from the ink of 5 empty pens, he can make 5 / 5 = 1 new pen from the ink of the 5 new pens.

So, in total, Ram gets 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens from the first set of pens) + 1 (new pen from the second set of pens) = 31 pens.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the total amount of money Johnny had after a year, we need to follow the steps he took.

1. Johnny started with $20.
2. He added an extra $10 to it, so now he has $20 + $10 = $30.
3. He invested this sum of money, which tripled in a year. This means he now has 3 times the original amount, so 3 * $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to determine their individual ages first.

Jessa is 20 years old.

Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan's age is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.

Remaining students = 1000 - 300 = 700

3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B:
3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students went out through exit B.
Remaining students = 700 - 420 = 280

The rest of the students went out through exit C:
280 students went out through exit C.

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and then multiply it by the time it takes him to write one page.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike writes in a week. He has 3 pen pals left, and each of them sends 2 letters a week. So, the total number of letters he receives is 3 * 2 = 6 letters.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he writes in a week is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to calculate the total minutes he used for his daily calls and the extra minutes, then subtract that from his total minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as 'x'. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin was left with (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27 to find the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.
7. Solving the equation 7 + x = 27, we get x = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as x. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for each day, then multiply it by the number of days, and finally multiply it by the number of weeks. 

The makeup artist charges $250 an hour and works 6 hours a day. 
Cost per day = 250 * 6 = $1500

She needs it done 4 times a week for 5 weeks. 
Total days = 4 * 5 = 20 days

Total cost before discount = 1500 * 20 = $30,000

After the movie is done, she gives a 10% discount. 
Discount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * 30,000 = $3000

Total cost after discount = $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, each weighing 50 pounds. So, the total weight of onions is:
4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost is:
200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"To find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday and Tuesday, we need to first determine how many cookies her sister ate on each day. 

Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday. 
On Tuesday, she ate 13 cookies. 

Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday. 
On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

The total number of cookies Sue ate is 20 + 26 = 46 cookies. 
The total number of cookies her sister ate is 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories. 
Her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed is 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls, the total number of girls in these two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls in the school is 50% of the total number of students. We know that each class has 20 students, and there are 3 classes, so the total number of students in the school is 20 * 3 = 60.

50% of 60 is 0.5 * 60 = 30. However, we already know that 27 girls are in the first two classes. So, the remaining girls in the school are 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% girls, it is also 50% boys. Therefore, the number of boys in the school is also 30.

The first class has 20 students, and 15 of them are girls. So, the number of boys in the first class is 20 - 15 = 5.

The second class has 20 students, and 12 of them are girls. So, the number of boys in the second class is 20 - 12 = 8.

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 5 + 8 = 13.

Since the total number of boys in the school is 30, and 13 boys are in the first two classes, the number of boys in the third class is 30 - 13 = 17.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's represent the number of cougars Rick killed today as 'x'. Then, the number of wolves he killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars he killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars he killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12 to find the number of wolves he killed today. Solving for x, we get x = 4.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of wolves he killed today, which is 3x = 3 * 4 = 12.

To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we add the number of animals he killed last night and today. The total number of wolves is 10 + 12 = 22, and the total number of cougars is 15 + 12 = 27.

The total number of animals Rick killed is 22 + 27 = 49.

"Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so the total number of cows is 10 * 20 = 200.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 10 stalls. Since there are 10 stalls, the number of cows added to each stall is 40 / 10 = 4.

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8: 24 * 8 = 192.

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections and then multiply it by the weight of each section. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, the termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of the total weight from the total weight to find the remaining weight. 

30% of 8000 is 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds. 

Now, we subtract 2400 from 8000 to get the final weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
2. Andrea has 52 apples, so Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.
4. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, let's count the total number of fruits:
- Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so she has 52 + 24 = 76 fruits.
- Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so he has 44 + 48 = 92 fruits.

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making and then multiply that by the amount of flour needed per cookie.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66 cookies.

Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies. 

First, let's find out how many dozens of cookies Carla is making: 66 / 12 = 5.5 dozen cookies.

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, we multiply 5.5 dozen by 2 cups: 5.5 * 2 = 11 cups of flour for 5.5 dozen cookies.

However, since Carla is making a fraction of a dozen (0.5 dozen) more cookies, we need to calculate the additional flour needed for that. 0.5 dozen is equal to 6 cookies, and 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, so we need to find out how many cups of flour are needed for 6 cookies. 

Since 12 cookies require 2 cups of flour, 6 cookies will require half of that, which is 1 cup of flour.

Now, we add the flour needed for the whole dozens and the additional flour needed for the fraction of a dozen: 11 cups + 1 cup = 12 cups of flour.

The transfer fee is 12% of $350,000, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find out how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract that from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

The total fees paid by Mr. Tan are $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

Now, let's subtract the total fees from the selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

Finally, let's subtract the remaining loan amount: $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

The final answer is: $118,000."
"To find the time it takes to heat up to 400 degrees, we need to calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 
So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 20 (to heat up to 300 degrees) + 28 (to heat up to 400 degrees) + 23 (to cook) = 71 minutes.

The final answer is: 71"
"To find the total amount spent on newspaper ads, multiply the cost of each ad by the number of ads: $5 * 50 = $250.

To find the total amount spent on television ads, multiply the cost of each ad by the number of ads: $75 * 15 = $1125.

To find the total amount spent on all ads, add the total spent on newspaper ads and television ads: $250 + $1125 = $1375.

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

The final answer is: 762"
"To find the total number of windows in the bedrooms, we first need to find the total number of bedrooms and then multiply it by the number of windows in each bedroom. 

There are 2 houses with 3 bedrooms each, so the total number of bedrooms is 2 * 3 = 6. 

Each bedroom has 2 windows, so the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12.

There are 4 additional windows in each house not connected to bedrooms, so the total number of additional windows is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of windows in both houses is the sum of the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows, which is 12 + 8 = 20.

"To find the number of stitches for the collar, we need to calculate a tenth of the body's stitches. 
Body's stitches: 900
Collar's stitches: 900 / 10 = 90

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
Rosette's stitches: 2 * 90 = 180

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette. 
Total stitches for collar and rosette: 90 + 180 = 270

The total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We subtract the stitches for the collar and the rosette to find the total stitches for the sleeves.
Total stitches for sleeves: 1800 - 270 = 1530

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total stitches for the sleeves by 2 to find the number of stitches for each sleeve.
Stitches for each sleeve: 1530 / 2 = 765

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, and then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to calculate the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C, and then subtract that from the total number of cards.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 
2/5 of 80 cards had the letter A, so (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards had the letter A.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B: 
1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B. The remaining cards are 80 - 32 = 48. So, (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards had the letter B.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C: 
5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C. The remaining cards are 48 - 24 = 24. So, (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards had the letter C.

Now, we add the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C: 
32 + 24 + 15 = 71 cards.

Finally, we subtract the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C from the total number of cards to find the number of cards with the letter D: 
80 - 71 = 9 cards.

Time for small holes: 3 minutes per hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 10 minutes per hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Total time in minutes: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we first need to find their current ages. 

Let's assume Mico's age is x and Marco's age is (20 - x), since the sum of their ages is 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be x + 10 and Marco's age will be (20 - x) + 10.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + ((20 - x) + 10).

Simplifying the equation, we get: 
x + 10 + 20 - x + 10 
= 40

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. 

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: R = 6S
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: (R + 9) = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:
S = 6

"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots per cobra: 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

Since the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras, we divide the number of spots per cobra by 2 to find the number of spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

To find the total number of spots on the mambas, we multiply the number of mambas by the number of spots per mamba: 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

Now, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

To find half the number of spots, we divide the total number of spots by 2: 4900 / 2 = 2450.

"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to first calculate the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace to find the length taken up by the sterling silver beads.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 of them, so the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. 

The length taken up by the sterling silver beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of beads, we divide the total length taken up by the beads (17 inches) by the length of each bead (1/4 inch).

17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = 68

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

Total stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week.

Alani doubled her 20 stories to 20 * 2 = 40 stories.
Braylen doubled his 40 stories to 40 * 2 = 80 stories.
Margot doubled her 60 stories to 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Total stories in the second week = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240

"To find out how many cents Kelly has initially, we need to calculate the total value of her quarters and dimes. 

Each quarter is worth 25 cents, and she has 5 quarters, so the total value of her quarters is 5 x 25 = 125 cents. 

Each dime is worth 10 cents, and she has 2 dimes, so the total value of her dimes is 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

The total value of her coins is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, we need to subtract the cost of the pop from the total value of her coins to find out how many cents she has left.

So, 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

"To find the time taken by the car in the fast lane, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. 

Given that the car in the fast lane traveled 480 miles at 60 miles/hour, we can calculate its time as follows:
Time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours.

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, its speed is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the same formula to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane:
Time = Distance / Speed = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ali has 22 medals.
2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
4. Together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, which means they have 1/10 of the total medals given out.

Let's represent the total medals given out as 'x'. Then, 1/10 of x is equal to 39. 

To find x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 10:
x = 39 * 10
x = 390

"To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. 

There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, each containing 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

4 adults will get 6 chocolate bars each, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

The remaining chocolate bars are 40 - 24 = 16.

There are 8 children, and they will share the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally. To find out how many each child will get, we divide 16 by 8.

16 / 8 = 2.

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the time to minutes first. 

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 21 + 1 = 22 points. 
Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point and still has 18 points. 
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the fourth round:

"To find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day. 

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 3 meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). So, the total rice consumption per person per day is 0.2 kg * 3 = 0.6 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total rice consumption per day is 0.6 kg * 5 = 3 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the daily consumption (3 kg).

42 kg / 3 kg per day = 14 days

Since we want to know how many weeks the rice will last, we need to convert the number of days to weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so:

14 days / 7 days per week = 2 weeks

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 2 weeks.

"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold and subtract that from his target.

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he didn't sell any crates on those days. He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 on Tuesday, 12 on Wednesday, and 18 on Thursday.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday)
Total crates sold = 65

Since Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 working days. His target for the week was 120 crates, but he had 5 working days instead of 7. To find out his target for 5 working days, we need to calculate the daily target and multiply it by 5.

Daily target = 120 / 7
Daily target = 17.14 (approximately)

Target for 5 working days = 17.14 * 5
Target for 5 working days = 85.7

Now, we can find out how many crates Sam was off from his target by subtracting the total crates sold from the target for 5 working days.

Crates off target = Target for 5 working days - Total crates sold
Crates off target = 85.7 - 65
Crates off target = 20.7

Since we can't sell a fraction of a crate, we can round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the exact difference, so we will keep the decimal.

1. Total miles driven: Since John goes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 = 60 miles. 
   He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven per year is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

2. Total cost of driving: He gets charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of driving per year is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

3. Total bonus paid: He gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

4. Total cost: The total cost is the sum of the total cost of driving and the total bonus paid, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we first need to determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

So, the number of loaves left after the morning sales is 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. Half of 20 is calculated as (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much weight Sandy loses in a week, we need to divide the total weight lost by Joey in 4 weeks by 4. 

Weight lost by Joey in 4 weeks = 8 pounds
Weight lost by Joey in 1 week = 8 / 4 = 2 pounds

Since Sandy loses the same amount of weight as Joey in a week, Sandy loses 2 pounds per week. 

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey in 4 weeks, we need to divide the total weight lost by Joey in 4 weeks by the weight lost by Sandy in a week.

Weight lost by Joey in 4 weeks = 8 pounds
Weight lost by Sandy in a week = 2 pounds
Number of weeks for Sandy to lose the same amount of weight = 8 / 2 = 4

However, the question states that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. This means that the question is asking for the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week, not 4 weeks. 

Weight lost by Joey in 1 week = 8 / 4 = 2 pounds
Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, the answer is 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. The discounted price is 2 x $11 = $22. The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. The discounted price is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2. The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the total number of new limbs, we need to calculate the number of arms and legs separately and then add them together.

The person will grow an extra arm every 3 days. In 15 days, they will grow arms 15 / 3 = 5 times. Since each time they grow an arm, they will have 2 new arms, so they will have 5 * 2 = 10 new arms.

The person will grow an extra leg every 5 days. In 15 days, they will grow legs 15 / 5 = 3 times. Since each time they grow a leg, they will have 2 new legs, so they will have 3 * 2 = 6 new legs.

The total number of new limbs is the sum of the new arms and legs: 10 + 6 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we need to calculate how much he has spent so far and subtract that from the total amount he has.

1. Cost of business suits: 6 suits * $100 = $600
2. Cost of suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 = $150
3. Cost of flight ticket: 5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500, and the flight ticket costs $700 more than that, so $500 + $700 = $1200
4. Total spent so far: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950
5. Total amount saved: $6000 - $1950 = $4050
6. Amount left for gifts: $4050 - $2000 = $2050

"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we first need to find the total number of eggs consumed in a day. 

There are 3 people who eat 3 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs they consume is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs. 

There are 2 people who eat 2 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs they consume is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs consumed in a day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
2. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
3. The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60000.
4. The population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, so the current population is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

The final answer is: 120000"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Total members = 105
2. Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D.
3. The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it's 2D.
4. The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it's D/2.
5. The sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams equals the total number of members: 2D + D + D/2 = 105

To solve for D, we need to combine like terms and isolate D:
2D + D + D/2 = 105
Combine like terms: 2.5D = 105
Divide both sides by 2.5: D = 105 / 2.5
D = 42

The final answer is: 42"
"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

2 families with 6 people: 2 * 6 = 12 people
3 families with 4 people: 3 * 4 = 12 people
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24 people

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness, and 1/4 of that number had previous commitments. 

1/4 of 8 is 8 / 4 = 2 people. 

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is 8 (due to illness) + 2 (previous commitments) = 10 people.

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited: 24 - 10 = 14 people.

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 (initial marbles) + 20 (bought from Johanna) + 8 (given by his father) = 98.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 98 * 2 = 196.

The final answer is: 196"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Cost = Volume * cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * 0.1
Cost = 12

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls, nongendered children, and then add them to the number of boys.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls is:
Girls = 3 * Boys = 3 * 30 = 90

Given that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, the number of nongendered children is:
Nongendered children = 1/10 * Boys = 1/10 * 30 = 3

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 3 electric wires, there is 1 electric pole.

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

1/3 = x/45

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

1 * 45 = 3x
45 = 3x

Now, divide both sides by 3 to find x:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of people who left the party. We know that 22 men stayed, and there were 25 men initially. So, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, the total number of people who left is 1/4 of the initial total number of people. Let's denote the initial total number of people as x. Then, 1/4x = 3.

To find x, we multiply both sides by 4: x = 3 * 4 = 12.

Now, we know that the initial total number of people was 12 + 25 (men) + 15 (women) = 52.

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, 3/4 of the total number of people stayed. The total number of people who stayed is 3/4 * 52 = 39.

We know that 22 men stayed, and we need to find the number of women who stayed. Let's denote the number of women who stayed as y. Then, 22 + y = 39.

To find y, we subtract 22 from both sides: y = 39 - 22 = 17.

So, the number of women who stayed is 17.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pencils Jam has, we know she has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. Since each box contains the same number of pencils, we can set up an equation to find the number of pencils in each box.

Let x be the number of pencils in each box. Then, 3x + 2 = 26.

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 24.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 8.

So, each box contains 8 pencils. 

Now, we know Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 * 8 = 24 pencils. She also has 2 loose pencils, so she has a total of 24 + 2 = 26 pencils.

Meg has 46 pencils.

To find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have, we add their pencils together: 26 + 46 = 72.

Since each box contains 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by 8 to find the total number of boxes needed: 72 / 8 = 9.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weakening of the coffee due to the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's calculate the weakening caused by the ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we need to find out how many ice cubes are required to achieve this. 

Let's assume the initial temperature of the coffee is 100 degrees (for simplicity). To cool it down to 35 degrees (100 - 65 = 35), we need to use ice cubes that cool the coffee by 13 degrees each. 

Number of ice cubes = (100 - 35) / 13 = 65 / 13 = 5

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, 5 ice cubes will make it 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Next, we need to consider the weakening caused by the added cream. The coffee is made 12 milliliters weaker by each ice cube, and 60 milliliters weaker by 5 ice cubes. Adding 15 milliliters of cream will make the coffee 15 milliliters weaker.

Total weakening = 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many old records were traded for the 7 new records. Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the number of old records traded must be double the number of new records.

Let's denote the number of new records as N and the number of old records as O. We know that 5 people came in and left with 7 new records, but since there are 5 people, the total number of new records is 7. However, this is the total number of new records given to all 5 people, not the number of new records each person got. 

Since the problem states that 5 people came in and left with 7 new records between them, we can assume that the 7 new records were distributed among the 5 people, so each person got 7/5 = 1.4 new records on average. However, since you can't trade a fraction of a record, this is not possible. 

However, we can assume that the 7 new records were given to 5 people, but the problem states that 5 people came in with old records and left with 7 new records between them. This means that the 5 people must have traded 2 old records for 1 new record. 

Let's assume that the 5 people traded x old records for the 7 new records. Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the total number of old records traded is 2x. 

Since the 5 people left with 7 new records, the total number of new records is 7. Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the total number of old records traded is 2x = 7 * 2 = 14.

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of junior programmers:
Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * Total number of employees
= 2/5 * 100
= 40

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is:
Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, let's find the total amount paid to junior programmers:
Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80,000

Now, let's find the salary of senior programmers:
Salary of senior programmers = Salary of junior programmers + $400
= $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, let's find the total amount paid to senior programmers:
Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144,000

Now, let's find the total amount paid to all programmers:
Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80,000 + $144,000
= $224,000

"Let's break down the information given:

- At the first bus stop, 5 people got in.
- At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 people got in.
- At the third stop, there were a total of 20 people.

Initially, let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'.

After the first stop, the total number of people on the bus is x + 5.

After the second stop, 7 people got down, so the total number of people on the bus is (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.
Then, 8 people got in, so the total number of people on the bus is x - 2 + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that at the third stop, there were a total of 20 people. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 20.

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: x = 20 - 6
x = 14

"To find out how many lollipops Oscar has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
2. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
3. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
4. He eats 3 more lollipops that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first find out how many percentage points the phone needs to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs to charge 100% - 60% = 40% more.

Since the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can find the time it takes to charge 40% by multiplying 40 by 3. 

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip, apply the rewards and the coupon to the current shopping trip, and then subtract the total from the amount spent on the current shopping trip.

The customer spent $80 on the last shopping trip, so they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

On the current shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. Since they had 4 rewards, they used $4 off the price. 

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8. 

So, the total discount is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

The customer paid $43 - $12 = $31 on this shopping trip.

- State tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B: 
- Annual income: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income before tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- State tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net incomes of both jobs. Job B has a higher net income of $32,400 compared to Job A's $24,000.

To find out how much more Nick will make at the job with a higher net pay rate, we subtract the lower net income from the higher net income:

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the shares after the first year and then after the second year.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1 + 0.5 = 1.5).
New price after the first year = $8 * 1.5 = $12.

The stock price decreases by 25% in the second year. To find the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%, or 1 - 0.25 = 0.75).
New price after the second year = $12 * 0.75 = $9.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as 'x'. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is 'x - 10'.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. 

So, we can write the equation: 
x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 
3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 
3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 70

Since the smallest group has 'x - 10' students, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from x:
x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60

"Let's break down the information given:

- Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total.
- He has twice as many chickens as cows.

Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as 2C (since he has twice as many chickens as cows).

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

C + 2C = 60

Combine like terms:

3C = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

C = 20

So, there are 20 cows and 2C = 40 chickens.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs:

- Each cow has 4 legs, so 20 cows have 20 x 4 = 80 legs.
- Each chicken has 2 legs, so 40 chickens have 40 x 2 = 80 legs.

   Blue beetle = 50 pounds

2. The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog: 
   Green toad = 50 pounds

3. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog: 
   Yellow snake = 50 + 10 = 60 pounds

4. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog: 
   Red bird = 50 - 20 = 30 pounds

Now, we can find the total weight of the animals by adding their weights:
Total weight of animals = Pink frog + Blue beetle + Green toad + Yellow snake + Red bird
Total weight of animals = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds

The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. 1/5 of 5000 meters is 5000 * (1/5) = 1000 meters. 

So, the new daily distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since there are 30 days in June, the total distance covered in June is 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180000"
"To find the price of Juice Box B, we need to add 5 dollars to the price of Juice Box A. 
Price of Juice Box A = 4 dollars
Price of Juice Box B = Price of Juice Box A + 5 dollars = 4 + 5 = 9 dollars

To find the price of Juice Box C, we need to add 7 dollars to the price of Juice Box A.
Price of Juice Box C = Price of Juice Box A + 7 dollars = 4 + 7 = 11 dollars

Now, we need to find the difference between the price of Juice Box C and Juice Box B.
Difference = Price of Juice Box C - Price of Juice Box B = 11 - 9 = 2 dollars

"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband, and then subtract that from the total number of cookies in a bag.

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 cookies per week.

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies per week.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies per week.

Since there are 36 cookies in a bag, and 27 are consumed by her son and husband, Jenny eats the remaining cookies. 

36 - 27 = 9

Jenny eats 9 cookies per week."
"To find the total cost of the shirts, first, we need to find the discount amount. 

The original price of 2 shirts is 2 * $30 = $60.

"To find the total time John spent, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then find the total. 

Time spent boating: 6 hours
Time spent swimming: 6 / 2 = 3 hours
Time spent watching shows: 3 * 2 = 6 hours
Total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours

Since watching shows was 30% of the total time, we can set up the equation: 30% * Total time = 6 hours
To find the total time, we can divide both sides by 30% (or 0.3): Total time = 6 / 0.3 = 20 hours

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time: Time spent sightseeing = 40% * 20 hours = 0.4 * 20 = 8 hours

Annabelle still needs to save $45."
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we first need to find the height of the second tree. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, which is 6 feet. 

Height of the second tree = Height of the shortest tree + 5 feet
Height of the second tree = 6 + 5
Height of the second tree = 11 feet

Now, we need to find the combined height of the two trees. 

Combined height of the two trees = Height of the shortest tree + Height of the second tree
Combined height of the two trees = 6 + 11
Combined height of the two trees = 17 feet

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two trees.

Height of the tallest tree = 2 * Combined height of the two trees
Height of the tallest tree = 2 * 17
Height of the tallest tree = 34 feet

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is $5 per person. Since she wants to play one round, the total cost for mini-golf is $5. 

The cost of arcade tokens is $5. 

The cost of go-karts is $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice. So, the total cost for go-karts is 2 * $10 = $20.

The total cost for all activities is $5 (mini-golf) + $5 (arcade tokens) + $20 (go-karts) = $30.

Morgan's dad has a budget of $90. To find out how many friends she can invite, we subtract the total cost of activities from the budget: $90 - $30 = $60.

Since the cost of mini-golf is $5 per person, we divide the remaining budget by the cost of mini-golf: $60 / $5 = 12.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, let's find out how much change Billy has after buying the candy. 
   Billy has $10 and the candy costs $1.5 per pound. Let's assume he buys x pounds of candy. 
   The total cost of the candy is 1.5x dollars. 
   So, the change he has is 10 - 1.5x.

2. Then, he takes half of this change and spends it on gumballs. 
   Half of the change is (10 - 1.5x) / 2. 
   Since he buys 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2. 
   So, (10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2.

3. Now, let's solve the equation (10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2 for x.
   Multiply both sides by 2 to get 10 - 1.5x = 4.
   Subtract 10 from both sides to get -1.5x = -6.
   Divide both sides by -1.5 to get x = 4.

Let the age of Carver's son be 'x'. 

According to the problem, Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. This can be written as an equation: 

Carver's age = 2 * son's age - 5
45 = 2x - 5

To find the age of the son, we need to solve for 'x'. 

First, add 5 to both sides of the equation: 
45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5
50 = 2x

Next, divide both sides of the equation by 2: 
50 / 2 = 2x / 2
25 = x

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the three cities. 

Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
Distance from the third city to the first city: 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs)
Total distance in one trip: 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is:
225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles/day

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the distance it travels in a day (675 miles):
18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days

So, the train goes approximately 26.67 days between services."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed, we need to find the average of the stuffing needed for a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed.

2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S. 
   We can write the equation: S = 4 * 3 - 5
   S = 12 - 5
   S = 7
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V. 
   We can write the equation: V = 3 * S

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we need to add the interest to the principal to get the total amount Karan has to pay. 
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we can divide the total amount by the number of months to get the monthly payment.

3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Since Millie sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is:

36 cups * $1/cup = $36

Millie spent $18 on supplies, so her profit is:

$36 (revenue) - $18 (cost) = $18

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we need to find out how many hours it takes her to sell all the lemonade.

"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. 

First, we add up all the scores: 
65 + 94 = 159
159 + 81 = 240
240 + 86 = 326
326 + 74 = 400

Next, we divide the total by the number of tests: 
400 / 5 = 80

So, Wilson's current math grade is 80. 

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 6 erasers is 6 x $2 = $12.
The cost of 8 pencils is 8 x $3 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of erasers and pencils together: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu.

First, let's find the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and the number of messages to Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

The final answer is: 88"
"To find out how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of the rides for Dasha and compare it to the cost of the ride bracelet for David.

Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * $2 = $4.

Since they ride all 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha to buy tickets for all 9 rides is 9 * $4 = $36.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.

The cost for Dasha to ride all 9 rides is $36, and the cost for David to ride all 9 rides is $30. 

The difference in cost is $36 - $30 = $6.

David saves $6 by buying a ride bracelet instead of buying tickets for all 9 rides.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to first find out the total number of gifts she has to wrap, which is 6 (family) + 4 (friends) + 2 (teachers) = 12 gifts.

Since she wants to make a bow for each gift, she will need to divide the total amount of ribbon (144 inches) by the total number of gifts (12). 

144 / 12 = 12

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to find out how many popsicles each of them has. 

Let's assume the number of popsicles Betty has is 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has is 6x. 

Since the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can write the equation: 
5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms: 
11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11: 
x = 15

Now that we know x, we can find the number of popsicles each of them has: 
Betty has 5x = 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles
Sam has 6x = 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 
90 - 75 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. 

The normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $20. 

Since Tim saves 20% by bundling, we need to find 20% of $20. 
20% of $20 is 0.2 x $20 = $4.

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, he saves $60 - $26 = $34 by cancelling his cable subscription.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total time spent, we need to add up the time spent writing, recording, and editing the song. 

Time spent writing: 4 hours
Time spent recording: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
Time spent editing: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours

Total time spent = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours

Now, we need to find the percentage of time spent editing. To do this, we'll divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100.

Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of books Wendy wants to place, we first need to determine the number of books in the shelving system. Since it has 6 rows and 6 columns, we multiply the number of rows by the number of columns to get the total number of spaces for books.

6 rows * 6 columns = 36 spaces

Now, we need to double this number and add 20 to it. 

Double the number of spaces: 36 * 2 = 72
Add 20 to the doubled number: 72 + 20 = 92

Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

The final answer is: 92"
"To find out how many Valentine's cards Erica has now, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, added to the cards her dad brought, and then subtract the cards she passed out and add the cards she received.

Initially, Erica had 20 Valentine's cards.

Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each, so she got 2 * 15 = 30 cards.

She initially had 20 cards, and her dad brought 30, so she had 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

She had 50 cards and gave away 29, so she had 50 - 29 = 21 cards left.

She received 17 cards from family and friends, so she now has 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find out how many slices Jenny gave to Bill and Mark, we need to calculate 1/3 and 1/4 of the total slices.

1/3 of 12 slices is 12 * (1/3) = 4 slices.
1/4 of 12 slices is 12 * (1/4) = 3 slices.

So, Bill got 4 slices and Mark got 3 slices. Jenny gave away a total of 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so the total slices left are 12 - 7 - 2 = 3 slices.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many days Mark has to save his money, we need to divide the cost of the bike by the amount he earns per day.

"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Nancy saw 90 spiders. The number of millipedes is 1/3rd of the number of spiders, so the number of millipedes is 90 / 3 = 30.

The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12, so the number of stink bugs is 2 * 30 - 12 = 48.

Now, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs: 90 + 30 + 48 = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we first need to find Alice's age. 

Since Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, we can calculate Beth's age as follows:
Beth's age = Erica's age + 5
Beth's age = 30 + 5
Beth's age = 35

Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, we can calculate Alice's age as follows:
Alice's age = Beth's age + 7
Alice's age = 35 + 7
Alice's age = 42

Now, we can find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica:
Difference = Alice's age - Erica's age
Difference = 42 - 30

Since milk has 3 calories per ounce, the total calories consumed by John is:
16 ounces * 3 calories/ounce = 48 calories

The final answer is: 48"
"To find out how much the builder earns in a year, we need to calculate his daily earnings, then multiply it by the number of days he works in a year.

First, let's find out how many days he works in a year. He works 4 weeks every month, and there are 12 months in a year. 

Number of weeks worked in a year = 4 weeks/month * 12 months = 48 weeks/year

Since he works 6 days a week, the total number of days he works in a year is:
Total days worked in a year = 48 weeks/year * 6 days/week = 288 days/year

Now, let's find out his daily earnings:
Daily earnings = $50/day

Now, we can find out his total earnings in a year:
Total earnings in a year = Daily earnings * Total days worked in a year
Total earnings in a year = $50/day * 288 days/year
Total earnings in a year = $14400/year

The final answer is: $14400"
"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, he needs 4 times the amount of each ingredient. 

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs to buy:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs to buy:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the energy used per day and then multiply it by the number of days.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Since there are 8 hours of usage per day, the energy used per day is:
900 watts/hour * 8 hours/day = 7200 watts/day

Reducing the usage by 5 hours, the new usage per day is:
8 hours/day - 5 hours/day = 3 hours/day

The energy used per day with the reduced usage is:
900 watts/hour * 3 hours/day = 2700 watts/day

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original and reduced usage:
7200 watts/day - 2700 watts/day = 4500 watts/day

To convert watts to kilowatts, we divide by 1000 (since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts):
4500 watts/day / 1000 = 4.5 kilowatts/day

The energy saved in 30 days is:
4.5 kilowatts/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatt-hours

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the average number of stripes, we need to calculate the total number of stripes and divide it by the total number of zebras.

There are two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.
There is one zebra with 36 stripes.
There is another zebra with half the number of stripes as the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

The total number of stripes is 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.
The total number of zebras is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

The average number of stripes is 88 / 4 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required and then multiply it by their respective costs.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we need to find out how many sandwiches are required to serve 20 people.

Number of people = 20
Number of people per sandwich = 4
Number of sandwiches required = 20 / 4 = 5

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, the total amount of meat and cheese required is also 5 pounds each.

Cost of meat per pound = $7.00
Cost of cheese per pound = $3.00
Total amount of meat required = 5 pounds
Total amount of cheese required = 5 pounds

Total cost of meat = 5 pounds * $7.00/pound = $35.00
Total cost of cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00/pound = $15.00

Total cost = Total cost of meat + Total cost of cheese = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

He then bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he bought 60 cannolis, he now has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis. 

The number of corns he bought is 40 fewer than the number of cannolis, so he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns. 

Now, Allan has 80 (initial corns) + 60 (new corns) = 140 corns.

The total number of cannolis is 100.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 140 (corns) + 100 (cannolis) = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before the jog. 

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, before the jog, Elliott completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after the jog, we can find out how many steps he took during the jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. 

10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps completed before jog) = 4,000 steps left to complete. However, we are given that he had 2,000 steps left after the jog, so we need to subtract 2,000 from the 4,000 steps left to complete. 

4,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps.

Therefore, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

"To find out how many minutes Toby will be early, we need to calculate the total time it will take him to read the book and travel to the airport, and then subtract that from the time he has available.

First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:
45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Next, let's calculate the time it will take Toby to read the book:
9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Now, let's add the time it will take to get to the airport:
30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes

Since Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave for the airport, we can subtract the total time from the available time to find out how many minutes early he will be:
60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. So, the company had 40 - 10 = 30 employees in June. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds and the sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off,"" we can consider it as a 2-pound purchase with a discount on the second pound. The first pound costs $3, and the second pound is half off, which is $3 / 2 = $1.50. So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. She bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework.

The first package of fireworks costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.20: $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discount amount is subtracted from the total cost: $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150.

The total amount spent is the cost of the fireworks after the discount plus the cost of the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate how many cookies she will eat in 30 days. 

Since Shannon eats 2 cookies a night, and there are 30 days in the period, she will eat 2 * 30 = 60 cookies in 30 days.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she will eat by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make. 

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5 dozens.

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two conditions.

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50,000 candles smell like wet dog, so the number of candles that smell like wet dog is 0.05 * 50,000 = 2500.

Next, we need to find the number of candles that are more dangerous and have a 1% chance of exploding. However, the problem states that 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog, and the remaining 95% are the ones that are more dangerous but do not smell like wet dog. So, 95% of the candles that smell like wet dog are the ones that are more dangerous but do not explode. 

Since 5% of the candles smell like wet dog, 95% of 2500 candles are the ones that are more dangerous but do not smell like wet dog. This is 0.95 * 2500 = 2375 candles.

Now, we need to find the number of candles that are more dangerous and smell like wet dog. This is 5% of the total number of candles that are more dangerous, which is 0.05 * 2375 = 118.75. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a candle, we round down to 118 candles.

However, the problem states that 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of the candles are more dangerous and can explode. So, 1% of 50,000 candles are the ones that are more dangerous and can explode. This is 0.01 * 50,000 = 500 candles.

Now, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. This is the number of candles that are more dangerous and smell like wet dog, which is 118 candles.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The average trees are not specified, so let's call the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees 'x'.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 45 + x.
The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can set up the equation: 45 + x + 105 = 500.

Solving for x, we get: 
45 + x + 105 = 500
x + 150 = 500
x = 350

"Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We know that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each. 

We are given two pieces of information: 
1. The total number of heads is 180, which means C + D = 180.
2. The total number of bumps is 304, which means 2C + D = 304.

We can solve this system of equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation to eliminate D:
2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting C into the first equation:
D = 180 - C
D = 180 - 124
D = 56

"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the information given.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 4 * 200 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers. So, the total distance covered in the next two days is 240 kilometers.

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance covered is 0 kilometers.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 7 * 300 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, let's add up the distances covered in each period: 
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next two days: 240 kilometers
- Next day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance = 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The first bank gave him $4000. 
The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

So, the total amount of money he received from the banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Now, we add this amount to his initial capital of $5000. 
$12000 + $5000 = $17000.

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital."

1. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20.
   Now, the number of cats left on the rock is 50 - 20 = 30.
3. Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5.
   30 * (3/5) = 18
   So, 18 cats ran after the mouse.
4. Now, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats.

1. The first 6 months cost $8 per month, so the total cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.
2. The next 8 months cost $12 per month, so the total cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.
3. The remaining months in 2 years (24 months) minus the first 14 months (6 + 8) is 24 - 14 = 10 months. The cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, we add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The final answer is: $284"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. 
   Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J. 
   We can write the equation: J = T - 6.

2. The total savings is $6. 
   Since Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 2/3 from the tattered jeans. 
   We can write the equation: (1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6.

3. Substitute J from the first equation into the second equation: 
   (1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6.

4. Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 
   T - 6 + 2T = 18.

5. Combine like terms: 
   3T - 6 = 18.

6. Add 6 to both sides: 
   3T = 24.

7. Divide both sides by 3: 
   T = 8.

8. Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans, we can find the cost of the jogger jeans: 
   J = T - 6 = 8 - 6 = 2.

9. The jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

The final answer is: $2"

The capacity of the 4 buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
The capacity of the 6 minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
The capacity of the 10 minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The final answer is: 570"
"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

Lillian made 3 bird feeders, and each of these attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90.

She bought 3 bird feeders, and each of these attracts 20 birds. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden is 90 + 60 = 150.

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which is 4 + (4 * 0.25) = 4 + 1 = $5.
The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is 4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: 
4 (bagel) + 5 (soup) + 2 (cake) = 11

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how many cards he sold. Since he has $50 in spending cash and the ticket costs $100, he needs to make $50 from selling the cards. 

Since each card is sold for $1.5, we can calculate the number of cards he sold by dividing the amount he needs ($50) by the price per card ($1.5).

Number of cards sold = $50 / $1.5
Number of cards sold = 33.33 (round down to 33 since you can't sell a fraction of a card)

However, Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, which means he sold 2/3 of the cards. Let's represent the total number of cards as 'x'. 

2/3 * x = 33.33
x = 33.33 * (3/2)
x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards. 

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many guests were expected to have two hotdogs. Since half of the 36 guests were expected to have two hotdogs, that is 36 / 2 = 18 guests.

The caterer prepared enough hotdogs for these 18 guests to have two hotdogs each, which is a total of 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that 40 guests had two hotdogs each, which is a total of 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 36 hotdogs, there were not enough hotdogs for all 40 guests to have a second hotdog. The number of hotdogs that were not enough is 80 - 36 = 44 hotdogs.

Since each guest who got a second hotdog would have used up one of the 36 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is equal to the number of hotdogs that were not enough, which is 44. However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We are looking for the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog.

Since 40 guests showed up and 36 hotdogs were prepared, 40 - 36 = 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

The total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (her sister) = 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount, and then apply the 20% discount.

1. The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
2. The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
3. The cost of the 5 separate utensils is 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.
4. The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.
5. To find the discount amount, we need to calculate 20% of $165.00, which is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.
6. To find the total cost after the discount, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost before the discount: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, so she has a total of $2 + $16 = $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to first determine how many dragons Prince Arthur and Prince Walter slew, and then calculate one-fifth of that number.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. 
Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so Prince Arthur slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so Prince Bruce slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to find out how much gas was in one container. 

15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, so each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons of gas.

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, she needed 1/4 * 3 = 0.75 gallons of gas.

To convert gallons to pints, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, 0.75 gallons is equal to 0.75 * 8 = 6 pints.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George had left after buying the chips. Since he had 1% of his money left, that means he spent 99% of his money. 

Let's assume George had x dollars initially. Then, 99% of x is the amount he spent. We know that he spent $5, so we can set up the equation:

0.99x = 5

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.99:

x = 5 / 0.99
x = 5.05

So George had $5.05 initially. 

Now, let's find out how much he spent on chips. Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, or $0.40. He bought 3 bags, so the total cost of chips is:

3 * 0.40 = 1.20

Now, let's subtract the cost of chips from the initial amount to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

5.05 - 1.20 = 3.85

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, or $0.75. To find out how many candy bars he bought, we can divide the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

3.85 / 0.75 = 5.13

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 5 candy bars with $3.75 and have $0.10 left, which is not enough to buy another candy bar. Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to subtract the lollipops he kept from the total and then divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5, so the number of lollipops he shared is 25 - 5 = 20.

He shared these 20 lollipops with 4 friends, so each friend received 20 / 4 = 5 lollipops.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we first need to find out how much cake was eaten by Rory and her mom. Since they each had a piece, and there are 8 pieces in total, they ate 2 pieces.

Each piece is 20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece.

Since they ate 2 pieces, the total weight of the cake eaten is 2 pieces * 2.5 ounces per piece = 5 ounces.

The remaining cake weighs 20 ounces (initial weight) - 5 ounces (eaten) = 15 ounces.

"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to first find the total number of oranges they have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

They are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, including themselves, so the total number of people sharing the oranges is 8 (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people = 56 / 8 = 7

"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and divide it by the number of servings.

Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we first need to determine how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater. Since it takes four times as long for Bernadette to get to the theater as it does for Wayne, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes, it will take Bernadette 4 * 4 = 16 minutes to get to the theater.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

So, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. Since the area of the room is given as 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. 

1 yard = 3 feet
So, 3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:
Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room:
Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads they bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Difference in beads = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
= 140 - 60
= 80

"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven is on for 3 hours, and it raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase is 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window. The window is open for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes, so for 30 minutes, it cools down 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the final temperature. The initial temperature is 40 degrees. The temperature increase due to the oven is 15 degrees, and the temperature decrease due to the open window is 6 degrees. So, the final temperature is 40 + 15 - 6 = 49 degrees.

"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we first need to calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon. 

Jon's total time = 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (1 hour 20 minutes) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes.

We know that James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon. 10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. So James finished the swim in 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

We also know that James took 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Jon took 80 minutes on the bike, so James took 80 + 5 = 85 minutes on the bike.

Now we can find the time James took for the run by subtracting the time he took for the swim and bike from his total time. 

Time for the run = Total time - (time for swim + time for bike) = 180 - (36 + 85) = 180 - 121 = 59 minutes.

"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to calculate the distance it runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, we need to convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 

Distance = Speed * Time = 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to calculate the number of eggs in the dozen cases and add the loose eggs. 

1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs. Since Rozanne has 4 dozen cases, she has 4 x 12 = 48 eggs from the cases. Adding the 2 loose eggs, she has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so to find out how many glasses Rozanne can make, we divide the total number of eggs by 5. 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday:
17 sneakers were sold for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 x $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sale to the department store:
The salesman had 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.
These were sold for $25 each, so the revenue from the department store sale is:
31 x $25 = $775

The total revenue from both sales is:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The initial cost of the case of sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra.
2. The regular price of a soda is $3.
3. If you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2, it means the total cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda without the super ticket is $20 - $2 = $18.

Since the super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra, the cost of the movie ticket alone is $20 - $1 = $19. 

Now, let's consider the cost of the movie ticket without the super ticket, which is $18. This means the cost of the popcorn and soda without the super ticket is $18 - $19 = -$1, but since you can't have a negative cost, this is not possible. However, we know that the cost of the movie ticket without the super ticket is $12. 

So, the cost of the popcorn and soda without the super ticket is $18 - $12 = $6. Since the soda costs $3, the cost of the popcorn is $6 - $3 = $3.

The regular price of popcorn is $3."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is:

New cost = Original cost + Increase
New cost = 45 + 20
New cost = 65

Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new cost. 

Total cost = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
Total cost = 65 * 170
Total cost = 11050

Total distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average speed = 50 mph

"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies separately and then add them together.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires is:
8 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $6400

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she now has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.
The value of the 3 sapphires she traded is:
3 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $2400

The value of the 2 rubies she received is:
2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400

Now, let's add the value of the sapphires and rubies together:
$6400 (sapphires) + $2400 (value of traded sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $11200

The total value of Jenna's jewels is $11200.

"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is 160 * 12 = $1920.

"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the weight of each type of feed and add them together.

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Total weight of feed = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips.

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
= 3400 / 2250
= 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week. In a month (4 weeks), she drinks 3 * 4 = 12 aluminum cans. Since each aluminum can is worth 2 cents, her earnings from aluminum cans in a month are 12 * 2 = 24 cents.

Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week. In a month (4 weeks), she drinks 5 * 4 = 20 plastic bottles. Since each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, her earnings from plastic bottles in a month are 20 * 3 = 60 cents.

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, so:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

The final answer is: 9"

"To find out how many cards Miss Maria has in total, we need to calculate the number of basketball cards and baseball cards separately and then add them together.

Number of basketball cards: 6 decks * 25 cards per deck = 150 cards
Number of baseball cards: 5 boxes * 40 cards per box = 200 cards

Total number of cards = 150 + 200 = 350 cards

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards, the number of cards she gives to her students is 350 - 50 = 300 cards.

Each student gets 10 cards, so the number of students is 300 / 10 = 30.

"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to subtract the discount from the total cost of the apples. 

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.45 = $9. 
She received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = $8.

To find out how much Kelly paid, we need to subtract the discount from the total cost of the apples. 

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.5 = $10. 
She received a 10% discount, which is 10% of $10, or 0.1 * 10 = $1. 
So, she paid 10 - 1 = $9.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to subtract Becky's payment from Kelly's payment. 
9 - 8 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"

"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank has on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has after gaining new pairs and then subtract the shoes he gets rid of on Saturday.

Initially, Fireman Frank has 200 shoes.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, he gets 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.

On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.

On Friday, he gains 30 new pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

So, the total number of shoes he has after gaining new pairs is 200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300 shoes.

"To find the total number of pencils used, we first need to find the total number of pencils initially in the class. Since there are 30 students and each student started with 10 pencils, the total number of pencils is 30 * 10 = 300.

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. To find 1/5 of 300, we multiply 300 by 1/5, which is 300 * 1/5 = 60. So, 60 pencils were used.

The remaining pencils after two months are 300 - 60 = 240.

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. To find 1/3 of 240, we multiply 240 by 1/3, which is 240 * 1/3 = 80.

The number of pencils left at the end of the year is 80."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as (x/2) + 2.

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation: (x/2) + 2 = 5.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: (x/2) = 5 - 2, which simplifies to (x/2) = 3.

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: x = 3 * 2, which simplifies to x = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we'll convert the remoras' length from inches to feet. 

1 foot = 12 inches
6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet

There are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. 

Combined length of remoras = 1 foot
Length of shark = 10 feet

Percentage = (Combined length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of students, we need to first find the number of students who have a desktop computer at home. Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. 

Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. The number of students without a desktop computer is given as 20. Since one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer, we can set up the equation:

1/4 * x = 20

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

"To find out how many days Jason has to walk in total, we need to multiply the number of weeks by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week). 

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Since Jason can walk 4 days a week, we need to find out how many days he has to walk in total in 3 weeks. 

21 days / 3 weeks = 7 days per week

Now, we need to find out how many days Jason has to walk in total in 3 weeks. 

7 days/week * 3 weeks = 21 days

Since Jason has 21 days to break in the shoes and he can walk 4 days a week, we need to find out how many days he has to walk in a week. 

21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks

Now, we need to find out how many days Jason has to walk in a week. 

5.25 weeks * 7 days/week = 36.75 days

Since Jason has 36.75 days to break in the shoes and he can walk 4 days a week, we need to find out how many days he has to walk in a week. 

36.75 days / 4 days/week = 9.1875 days/week

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids who are allergic to at least one thing. 

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find this. 

Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts = (Number of kids allergic to dairy) + (Number of kids allergic to peanuts) - (Number of kids allergic to both)
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

However, this counts the kids allergic to both twice, so we need to subtract them once to avoid double counting. 

Total number of kids allergic to at least one thing = 12

Now, to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the total number of kids allergic to at least one thing from the total number of kids in the class.

Number of kids not allergic to anything = Total number of kids - Total number of kids allergic to at least one thing

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day, and it's 20% more expensive because it's a busy weekend. To find the increased price, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 * $1500 = $300. So, the increased price of the hotel is $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

"Let's denote the number of insects found by Bodhi as B, David as D, and Lily as L. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write an equation: L = D + 7.

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write another equation: D = B/2.

We are also given that together they collected 43 insects, so the sum of the insects found by each of them is 43: L + D + B = 43.

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the third equation: (D + 7) + D + B = 43.

Combine like terms: 2D + B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2D + B = 36.

Now, substitute the second equation into the new equation: 2(D) + B = 36, 2(B/2) + B = 36.

Simplify the equation: B + B = 36, 2B = 36.

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18.

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar spent. 

A 2 x 4 gives 200 sticks for $4, so the cost per stick is $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick.
A 2 x 8 gives 400 sticks for $6, so the cost per stick is $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick.

Since a 2 x 8 gives more sticks per dollar, we will use this type of wood. 

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with $24: 
$24 / $6 = 4

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of snowshoes needed by the cost per pair. The cost per pair is $12.00, so the total cost is 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To find out how much Janet spends on bus trips in a week, we need to calculate the cost of two bus trips per day for five days. 

Cost of two bus trips per day = 2 * $2.20 = $4.40
Cost of two bus trips per day for five days = $4.40 * 5 = $22.00

Now, we need to find out how much she would save by buying a weekly bus pass for $20. 

Amount saved = Cost of two bus trips per day for five days - Cost of weekly bus pass
Amount saved = $22.00 - $20.00
Amount saved = $2.00

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. This means the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Total number of animals in the farm and the zoo: 40 + 80 = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to first determine the total number of items Rose bought. Since Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, the total number of items she bought is 12 + 4 = 16.

We are told that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. So, if we let x be the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, then 4x = 16.

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 16 / 4 = 4.

Since x represents the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to find out how many of those were onions and how many were potatoes. However, the question does not specify the ratio of onions to potatoes Sophia bought. It only tells us that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. 

Since we know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, and the total number of items Sophia bought is 4, we can assume that Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato (since 3 + 1 = 4). 

However, this is an assumption and the question does not provide enough information to determine the exact ratio of onions to potatoes Sophia bought. 

But if we are looking for the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, the answer would be 4."
"To find the number of days Andy has to lose the weight, we need to calculate the difference between his birthday and today's date. 

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to January 1st is 1 day. 
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. 
February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. 
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. 
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days. 
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days. 
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days. 
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Adding these up, Andy has 160 days to lose the weight.

To lose 30 pounds, Andy needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 105,000 / 160 = 656.25 calories per day.

The final answer is: 656.25"
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate his total earnings for the week and subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald works 7 days a week, and he earns $30 per day. So, his total earnings for the week are:

7 days * $30/day = $210

Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

$210 - $100 = $110

Gerald has $110 left."
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we need to calculate the total distance she will run. 

First, we need to find out the total distance of 8 laps. 
Distance per lap = 0.25 km
Total laps = 8
Total distance = Distance per lap * Total laps
Total distance = 0.25 km * 8
Total distance = 2 km

Since Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, we can multiply the total distance by the amount of water she needs per kilometer.
Total water needed = Total distance * Water per kilometer
Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km
Total water needed = 120 ml

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

First, Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes. 
20% of $500 = 0.2 * $500 = $100

Now, Julie has $500 - $100 = $400 left.

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining money on CDs.
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, Julie has $400 - $100 = $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000

Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x = 3 * 30,000 = 90,000

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the canvas bags, which is 8 packs of 5 bags for $4 each. 
First, find the total number of bags: 8 packs * 5 bags/pack = 40 bags
Then, find the total cost: 40 bags * $4/bag = $160

The total revenue is the amount she earned from selling the bags, which is 40 bags * $8/bag = $320

Now, find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $320 - $160 = $160

The final answer is: $160"
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total time of the fight and multiply it by the average number of punches he throws per minute.

The fight lasts for 5 rounds of 3 minutes each, so the total time is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, the total number of punches he threw is 15 * 25 = 375.

The final answer is: 375"
"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, Josh made 36 / 4 = 9 cookies.

Since Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, we multiply the number of cookies Josh made by 2. Kelsie made 9 * 2 = 18 cookies.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Ali has: 
   Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. 
   Total money from $10 bills = 4 * $10 = $40
   Total money from $20 bills = 6 * $20 = $120
   Total money = $40 + $120 = $160

2. Ali gives his sister half of the total money:
   Half of the total money = $160 / 2 = $80
   Money left after giving his sister half = $160 - $80 = $80

3. Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner:
   3/5 of $80 = (3/5) * $80 = $48
   Money left after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find out how long Royce takes, we first need to determine how long it takes Rob to shingle a house in minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we convert 2 hours to minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 120 minutes.

Since Royce takes double the time it takes Rob plus 40 minutes, we can set up the equation: Royce's time = (2 * Rob's time) + 40 minutes. 

Substituting Rob's time (120 minutes) into the equation, we get: Royce's time = (2 * 120) + 40 = 240 + 40 = 280 minutes.

"To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to calculate the number of problems he completed each day and subtract that from the total.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems. 
On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.
So, in total, Chris completed 12 + 36 = 48 problems on Monday and Tuesday.

He has 100 math problems in total, so the number of problems left after Monday and Tuesday is 100 - 48 = 52.

On Wednesday, Chris completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

So, the number of problems left after Wednesday is 52 - 13 = 39.

Therefore, Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday.

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to calculate the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour and then add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour: 
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

The bakers had 62 loaves of bread left."
"To find the number of rows of red tulips, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips per row: 36 / 6 = 6 rows of red tulips.

To find the number of rows of blue tulips, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips per row: 24 / 8 = 3 rows of blue tulips.

Since the question asks for the total number of rows of flowers, we add the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips: 6 + 3 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to first determine how many cups of raisins she has available for the oatmeal cookies. 

Since she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, she will have 1/3 of the raisins for each. 

1/3 of 27 cups of raisins is 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we need to divide 9 cups by 3/4 to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make.

To divide 9 by 3/4, we can multiply 9 by the reciprocal of 3/4, which is 4/3.

9 * (4/3) = 12

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption is 12 * 24 = 288 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day. 

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. Her daily consumption will be 14 * 24 = 336 kWh per day.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. 

Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly consumption is 288 * 7 = 2016 kWh per week. 

After adding the new device, her weekly consumption is 336 * 7 = 2352 kWh per week.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kWh. 

Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly bill is 2016 * $1.50 = $3024 per week.

After adding the new device, Ada's weekly bill is 2352 * $1.50 = $3528 per week.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $3528 - $3024 = $504.

The final answer is: $504"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it would take one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take them 10 days to paint a whole house (since it would take twice as long to paint the entire house).

Since there are 24 hours in a day, it would take one person 10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours to paint a whole house.

Now, if 5 people are painting the house, it would take them less time since they are working together. To find the time it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we need to divide the total time it would take one person by the number of people.

Time for 5 people = Time for 1 person / Number of people
Time for 5 people = 240 hours / 5
Time for 5 people = 48 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:
Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so she has 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture.
Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so she has 64 + 66 = 130 pieces of furniture.
The total number of sofas and chairs they have is 42 + 130 = 172.

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we first need to find out how many CDs he could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set. 

Let's first find out how much money Tom spent on the headphone set. 

Total money spent = $48
Money spent on CD = $4
Money spent on headphone set = Total money spent - Money spent on CD
Money spent on headphone set = $48 - $4
Money spent on headphone set = $44

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set.

Money spent on headphone set = $44
Money spent on one CD = $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought with the money spent on headphone set = Money spent on headphone set / Money spent on one CD
Number of CDs that could have been bought with the money spent on headphone set = $44 / $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought with the money spent on headphone set = 11

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the total money he had.

Total money = $48
Money spent on one CD = $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought with the total money = Total money / Money spent on one CD
Number of CDs that could have been bought with the total money = $48 / $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought with the total money = 12

Now, let's find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

Number of CDs that could have been bought with the total money = 12
Number of CDs that could have been bought with the money spent on headphone set = 11
Number of more CDs that could have been bought = Number of CDs that could have been bought with the total money - Number of CDs that could have been bought with the money spent on headphone set
Number of more CDs that could have been bought = 12 - 11
Number of more CDs that could have been bought = 1

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours spent in the weeks where he worked out 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours.

In the weeks where he worked out 4 hours, there are 6 weeks (since 8 weeks - 2 weeks = 6 weeks). So, the total hours spent in these weeks is 6 * 4 = 24 hours.

In the weeks where he worked out 5 hours, there are 2 weeks. So, the total hours spent in these weeks is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

In the week where he worked out 6 hours, there is 1 week. So, the total hours spent in this week is 1 * 6 = 6 hours.

Now, we add up the total hours spent in all the weeks: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours.

The total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get in.
Now, the total number of people on the bus is:
40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 21 got off, 3 times fewer would be 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 passengers get in.
Now, the total number of people on the bus is:
59 (left) + 7 (got in) = 66

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.
   Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years.
   So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.
3. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, let's find the difference in their current ages: 
Current age of Jame - Current age of his cousin = 22 - 47 = -25 years.

However, since age difference cannot be negative, we need to consider the absolute value of the difference, which is 25 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to find the cost of the printer. Since the computer cost $1,100 and the printer cost $400 less, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.

Since the total cost of all items is $2,400, the cost of the two monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the monitors by 2: $600 / 2 = $300.

"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we first need to determine the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Since there are 10 boys (half of 20 kids) and each brought 60 shells, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + (4 * 600) seashells. 

First, we calculate 4 times the number of seashells brought by the boys: 4 * 600 = 2400.

Then, we add the number of seashells brought by the boys to this: 600 + 2400 = 3000.

Since there are 10 girls (half of 20 kids), we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by 10 to find out how many seashells each girl brought: 3000 / 10 = 300.

"To find the thickness of the third book, we need to subtract 5 mm from the thickness of the second book. 
Thickness of the third book = Thickness of the second book - 5 mm
Thickness of the third book = 50 mm - 5 mm
Thickness of the third book = 45 mm

To find the thickness of the fourth book, we need to multiply the thickness of the first book by 2.
Thickness of the fourth book = 2 * Thickness of the first book
Thickness of the fourth book = 2 * 31 mm
Thickness of the fourth book = 62 mm

Now, we can find the total thickness of the four books by adding the thickness of all four books.
Total thickness = Thickness of the first book + Thickness of the second book + Thickness of the third book + Thickness of the fourth book
Total thickness = 31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm

Emma made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

Total vlogs made = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Since Emma can make 72 vlogs per month, we subtract the total vlogs made from the target:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys. 

Let's assume the eldest boy's share is x. Then, the other two boys' shares will be (18 - x)/2 each.

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so his new share is x + 5.

The following day, he added another $10, making his share x + 15.

He then spent $8 from his total, so his share becomes x + 15 - 8 = x + 7.

After that, he tripled the amount he had left, so his new share is 3(x + 7).

Since the initial share was x, we can set up an equation to find x. The total amount shared initially is $18, so the sum of the shares of all three boys is 3x = 18. 

Solving for x, we get x = 6.

Now, we can find the eldest boy's current share: 3(x + 7) = 3(6 + 7) = 3(13) = 39.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Elvis needs to save in the first half of the month. 

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of the month is x. Then, the number of days in the second half of the month is also x (since the month has 30 days, the first half has 15 days and the second half has 15 days).

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves in the first half as y. Then, the amount he saves in the second half is 2y.

The total amount Elvis needs to save in the month is $1125. So, we can set up the equation:

x * y + x * 2y = 1125

Combine like terms:

3xy = 1125

Divide both sides by 3x:

y = 1125 / (3x)

Since x is the number of days in the first half of the month, and the first half of the month has 15 days, x = 15.

y = 1125 / (3 * 15)
y = 1125 / 45
y = 25

Now that we know y, we can find the amount Elvis needs to save in the second half of the month, which is 2y:

2y = 2 * 25
2y = 50

Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars. 

The total amount of money they have is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation: x + 4x = 100.

Combine like terms: 5x = 100.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 20.

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4(20) = 80 dollars.

The final answer is: $80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the total miles he walks each day is 3 miles * 2 = 6 miles.

Now, we multiply the miles he walks each day by the number of days he works in a week: 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice: 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters
2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once: 26 / 2 = 13 letters
3. So, the total number of letters written so far is 52 + 13 = 65 letters
4. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written: 65 letters

Now, let's add the re-written letters to the total: 65 + 65 = 130 letters

The final answer is: 130"
"This is a classic example of exponential growth, specifically a geometric progression. 

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, so there are 3 * 3 = 9 new families notified. 

In the third round, each of the 9 families from the second round calls 3 other families, so there are 9 * 3 = 27 new families notified. 

In the fourth round, each of the 27 families from the third round calls 3 other families, so there are 27 * 3 = 81 new families notified.

The total number of families notified in the fourth round is 81."
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and then add that to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight he lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Since Mark's final weight was 70 pounds, we can find his initial weight by adding the weight he lost to his final weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first determine the total number of toys in the larger play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys and the larger set is five times larger, we multiply 80 by 5.

80 * 5 = 400

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys to have enough for the larger set, we subtract 2 from the total number of toys in the larger set to find out how many toys Jonathan currently has.

400 - 2 = 398

The final answer is: 398"
"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

Cost of 2 pens: 2 x $0.25 = $0.50
Cost of 1 calculator: $12
Cost of 1 geometry set: $10
Total cost before discount: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

Now, we need to apply the 10% discount to the total cost. 
10% of $30 = 0.1 x $30 = $3
Discounted cost: $30 - $3 = $27

The final answer is: $27"
"To find the total cost of the items, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the sales above $1000.

For the first $1000, she earns a 30% commission:
$1000 * 0.30 = $300

For the sales above $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, she earns an additional 10% commission:
$1500 * 0.10 = $150

Now, we add the two amounts together to get her total earnings:
$300 + $150 = $450

The final answer is: $450"
"To find out how many bottles Bill needs in total, we first need to calculate the number of bottles he already has. He has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, so he has 2 x 24 = 48 bottles.

Since he wants 2 bottles for each of his 70 guests, he needs 70 x 2 = 140 bottles in total.

To find out how many additional bottles he needs, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92.

The final answer is: 92"
"To find out how long Ray takes to swim a mile on a hot day, we need to first calculate the time it takes him to swim a mile on a warm day. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Twice the time it takes to swim a mile in cold water is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. 

So, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day. 

On a cold day, Ray swims 3 miles in 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

On a hot day, Ray swims 3 miles in 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time between a hot day and a cold day is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To find out how many cups Juan needs to reduce, we first need to determine how many cups he currently drinks. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, and Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, we need to know the daily recommended amount of coffee.

Let's assume the daily recommended amount of coffee is x cups. Since Octavia drinks half of this amount, she drinks x/2 cups. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

We are given that the daily recommended amount of coffee is 4 cups. So, x = 4. 

Now, we can find out how many cups Juan currently drinks: 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups.

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to 4 cups, we need to find the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake: 20 - 4 = 16 cups.

"To find the average weight of the 3 friends, we need to first find their individual weights. 

Mark weighs 150 pounds. 
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total weight of the 3 friends. 
Total weight = Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends. 
Average weight = Total weight / Number of friends = 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

"To find the final angle of the sun from the ground, we need to add the initial angle of the pyramid (32 degrees) to the angle the sun moves (5 degrees per hour) multiplied by the number of hours it moves (10 hours).

Initial angle of the pyramid = 32 degrees
Angle the sun moves per hour = 5 degrees
Number of hours the sun moves = 10 hours

Final angle of the sun from the ground = Initial angle of the pyramid + (Angle the sun moves per hour * Number of hours the sun moves)

"To find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of candles he needs. Since one son is 12 and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Typically, birthday candles are one per year of age, so James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed by the number of candles per pack: 20 / 5 = 4.

Since James needs 4 packs of candles and each pack costs $3, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 4 * 3 = 12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week and then convert that to pages. 

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we need to find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which is 105 / 1.5 = 70.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, she can read 2 * 70 = 140 pages in 105 minutes.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

So, in two weeks, Judy read 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to calculate the amount for each set of teeth and add them together.

For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left $5.00.

For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00 each, so the total is 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, the total for the last two teeth is 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find out how many goals Mark and Anna scored, we need to work backwards from Richie's score.

Since Richie scored 80 goals and he scored 45 more goals than Anna, Anna must have scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals.

Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, Mark must have scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals.

Now, we know the number of goals each teenager scored: Richie scored 80 goals, Mark scored 60 goals, and Anna scored 35 goals.

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add their individual scores: 80 + 60 + 35 = 175.

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we need to first find out how much money Mitchell made and then subtract the amount Liam made.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so he made 21 * 4 = $84.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how many action figures he bought each day and then add them up.

From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day on wooden action figures. Since he spent $70 in total, we can calculate the number of days he spent on wooden action figures as follows:

70 / 5 = 14 days

However, he only spent 4 days on wooden action figures (Sunday through Wednesday), so he spent 4 days on wooden action figures, not 14. 

The amount spent on wooden action figures is 4 * 5 = 20 dollars. 

The remaining amount of money is 70 - 20 = 50 dollars.

Since he has 50 dollars left and he has 3 days left in the week, we can calculate the number of plastic action figures he can buy as follows:

50 / 2 = 25

So, Peter bought 25 plastic action figures.

Now, let's add the number of wooden and plastic action figures he bought:

4 (wooden action figures) + 25 (plastic action figures) = 29

The total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 29."

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to first calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is: 
20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is: 
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is: 
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows from the total number of roses ordered: 
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month.

"To find out how much money will be remaining in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she will have withdrawn and subtract it from the initial amount.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 x 12 = 24 months.

Katina removes $100 from the account every month, so the total amount she will withdraw in 24 months is 24 x $100 = $2400.

Now, we subtract the total amount withdrawn from the initial amount in the account: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her account.

"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. So, the cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30 per sandwich.

The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00. So, the cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00 per sandwich.

The total cost per sandwich is the sum of the cost of bread and cheese/condiments: $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30 per sandwich.

The revenue per sandwich is $7.00.

The net profit per sandwich is the revenue per sandwich minus the total cost per sandwich: $7.00 - $3.30 = $3.70 per sandwich.

Since they sell 10 sandwiches, the total revenue is 10 x $7.00 = $70.00, and the total cost is 10 x $3.30 = $33.00.

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to determine how many muffin crayons she can make and then multiply that number by the price of each muffin crayon.

Since Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons, she has a total of 3 * 64 = 192 crayons.

She melts 8 crayons together to make one muffin crayon, so the total number of muffin crayons she can make is 192 / 8 = 24.

Now, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price of each: 24 * $1.50 = $36.

"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18.

The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4%, we need to find the temperature that is 4% less than 520.

To do this, we can calculate 4% of 520 and subtract it from 520.

4% of 520 is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.

Now, subtract 20.8 from 520 to get the temperature that Maggie should set her oven to: 520 - 20.8 = 499.2.

So, Maggie should set her oven to 499.2 degrees.

499.2"
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time as follows:
1 hour = 60 minutes
Adding 30 minutes to that gives us:
60 + 30 = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the time as follows:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
Adding 5 minutes to that gives us:

"To find the total number of utensils brought by Judy, we first need to determine how many cups and dishes she brought. 

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups Judy brought is 12, and the total number of dishes she brought is 24. The total number of cups her friend brought is 40, and the total number of dishes her friend brought is 44.

To find the total number of utensils brought by Judy, we add the number of cups and dishes she brought: 12 + 24 = 36.

To find the total number of utensils brought by her friend, we add the number of cups and dishes her friend brought: 40 + 44 = 84.

The total number of utensils brought by the two is the sum of the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend: 36 + 84 = 120.

"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we first need to find the total number of pairs of contacts Pete will have. Since 90 contacts last 45 days, we can find the number of pairs per day by dividing 90 by 45.

90 contacts / 45 days = 2 pairs per day

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, he will have a total of 180 contacts (2 boxes * 90 contacts per box). 

180 contacts / 45 days = 4 pairs per day

Now, we need to find the total cost of 2 boxes with a 10% discount. The original price of 2 boxes is $200. 

Original price of 2 boxes = $100 * 2 = $200
Discount = 10% of $200 = 0.1 * $200 = $20
Price after discount = $200 - $20 = $180

Now, we can find the cost per pair of contacts by dividing the total cost by the total number of pairs.

Cost per pair = Total cost / Total pairs
= $180 / (4 pairs per day * 365 days per year)
= $180 / 1460 pairs
= $0.123 (approximately)

However, since the question asks for the cost per pair of contacts, we can simplify the calculation by considering the total number of pairs Pete will have in a year.

Total pairs per year = 4 pairs per day * 365 days per year
= 1460 pairs per year

Cost per pair = $180 / 1460 pairs
= $0.123 (approximately)

However, the question asks for the cost per pair of contacts, not the cost per pair per year. To find the cost per pair of contacts, we need to consider the total number of pairs Pete will have in 45 days (the duration for which the contacts last).

Total pairs in 45 days = 4 pairs per day * 45 days
= 180 pairs

Cost per pair = $180 / 180 pairs

"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate the total hours they worked and multiply it by their hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. In total, John worked 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Jill's total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30. John's total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many calories Hannah burns in total, we need to calculate the calories burned during aerobics and running. 

Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times 100 ml is needed.

Total calories burned: 1600
Divide by 200: 1600 / 200 = 8

So, Hannah needs to drink 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water. 

The final answer is: 800"
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. 

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans) and G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans).

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3.01B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3.01:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:

G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM. 
After the first increase, his speed is 52 WPM. 
To find the second increase, we add 5 WPM to 52 WPM: 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now we have the three measurements: 47, 52, and 57. 

To find the average, we add the three measurements and divide by 3: 
(47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"To find the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then subtract the weight change for the first option from the weight change for the second option.

For the first option (eating Cheerios), Martin loses 1.25 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he will lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

For the second option (eating donuts), Martin gains 1.75 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he will gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

"To find the total number of people attending, we need to break down the information given:

1. Alex invites 100 people via email, and each of them invites 2 friends. So, the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

2. Alex then calls 10 friends and 8 of them say they will bring their spouses. This means 8 couples will be attending, which is 8 * 2 = 16 people. So, the total number of people Alex's friends are bringing is 10 + 16 = 26.

3. To find the total number of people attending, we add the people invited via email and the people Alex's friends are bringing: 300 + 26 = 326.

However, we also need to include Alex herself, so the total number of people attending is 326 + 1 = 327.

"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to find the weight of the Papillon first, then multiply it by 44.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. 

The cost of the boots on eBay is $13. 
The shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

So, the total cost of the boots on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

The total cost of the boots on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to reach or exceed 20 feet. 

The beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles every day. 

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 8 feet
Day 3: 16 feet
Day 4: 32 feet

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Jerry's current age be x.

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can write an equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown, and then subtract the deposit he has already paid.

The base price of each implant is $2000. Since George needs 2 implants, the total cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000.

He wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already paid a deposit of $600. To find out how much he still needs to pay, we subtract the deposit from the total cost: $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour at work, to find out how many hours he needs to work to pay for the dental work, we divide the amount he still needs to pay by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it can be represented as 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, it can be represented as 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. 
One angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees.
One angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

8 quarters = 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
6 dimes = 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

Total amount of money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball
= 345 cents / 5 cents
= 69

"To find the weight that Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds and add it to 8 pounds.

50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds.

Adding 4 pounds to 8 pounds gives us 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

Since Jamaal then uses a weight two pounds lighter than 12 pounds, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he gets each year and add them up.

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 12 games for saving money (1 game per month) and 5 games for Christmas. So, the total number of games in the first year is 5 + 12 + 5 = 22.

In the second year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift, 24 games for saving money (2 games per month), and 5 games for Christmas. So, the total number of games in the second year is 5 + 24 + 5 = 34.

In the third year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift, 48 games for saving money (4 games per month), and 5 games for Christmas. So, the total number of games in the third year is 5 + 48 + 5 = 58.

Now, we add up the total number of games from each year: 22 + 34 + 58 = 114.

"To find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to first find out how many pounds Ruiz makes in an hour. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how many pounds he makes in an hour, we divide 120 by 2. 
120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour. 
3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, we know that both Ruiz and Marissa make 60 and 45 pounds of chocolates per hour respectively. 

In 12 hours, Ruiz will make 60 * 12 = 720 pounds of chocolates.
In 12 hours, Marissa will make 45 * 12 = 540 pounds of chocolates.

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260.

Total cups sold in the first four hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups
Total revenue in the first four hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

In the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
Total cups sold in the next two hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups
Total revenue in the next two hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

"To find out how many rotations the tires undergo in a month, we need to multiply the number of rotations per 2 miles by the number of miles driven in a month. 

Rotations per 2 miles: 725
Miles driven in a month: 400

Rotations per month = (725 * 2) * 400 = 580,000 rotations per month

Now, we need to find out how many months the tire can last before it needs to be replaced. 

Total rotations allowed: 10,440,000
Rotations per month: 580,000

Months before replacement = Total rotations allowed / Rotations per month
Months before replacement = 10,440,000 / 580,000
Months before replacement = 18

To find the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to divide the number of months by 12.

Years before replacement = Months before replacement / 12
Years before replacement = 18 / 12
Years before replacement = 1.5

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
Discount amount = 30% of $60 = 0.3 * $60 = $18

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost. 
Final cost = Total cost before discount - Discount amount = $60 - $18 = $42

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to calculate it separately. 

Joe started with $50, and the final cost is $42. 
So, the amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase is $50 - $42 = $8."
"To find the total number of pounds of butter needed, we first need to find out how many pounds of butter are needed to make 4 dozen croissants. 

Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, it will take 4 times that amount to make 4 dozen croissants. 

4 * (1/4) = 1 pound of butter is needed to make 1 dozen croissants. 
To make 4 dozen croissants, it will take 4 times that amount: 
4 * 1 = 4 pounds of butter.

Since Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week, we need to multiply the amount of butter needed for one day by 7.

4 pounds * 7 = 28 pounds of butter.

The number of cars towed on the first three days is 10 * 3 = 30.

The number of cars towed on the remaining days is 7 - 3 = 4 days. Since 4 fewer cars were towed on each of these days, the number of cars towed on each of these days is 10 - 4 = 6. So, the total number of cars towed on the remaining days is 6 * 4 = 24.

The total number of cars towed that week is 30 + 24 = 54.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height (4 feet) and Adam's current height (40 inches), and then divide that by the rate at which he grows (2 inches per year).

First, let's convert the required height to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the required height and Adam's current height: 48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches.

Finally, let's divide the difference by the growth rate: 8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars, then calculate his commission on that profit.

First, let's find the total cost of the cars: 
10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000

The company paid 30% of the cost to acquire the cars, so the amount they paid is:
$250,000 * 0.3 = $75,000

The profit from selling the cars is the selling price minus the cost to acquire them:
Profit = Selling price - Cost to acquire
Profit = $250,000 - $75,000
Profit = $175,000

James got a 10% commission on the profit:
Commission = Profit * 0.1
Commission = $175,000 * 0.1
Commission = $17,500

So, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of men who can stay upright, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, and there are 100 riders, we can calculate this as 25% of 100, which is 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders.

Next, we are told that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women, we can calculate 60% of 25, which is 0.6 * 25 = 15 women.

Since there are 25 riders in total who can stay upright, and 15 of them are women, the number of men who can stay upright is 25 - 15 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to find the price of the gold and silver jewels first.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

Given that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and add them together.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to determine the relative speed between them. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we'll consider the distance Tom needs to cover to catch up.

Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph
Relative speed = 15 mph

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to first determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch by subtracting 6 from Naomi's catch.

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught. Since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, we can calculate Tommy's catch by adding 3 to Darren's catch.

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Total cost of classes = $60
Number of classes = 10

Cost per class = Total cost of classes / Number of classes
Cost per class = $60 / 10
Cost per class = $6

Since Manny's parents will not sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to find the number of classes he can attend at $6 per class.

Let's assume Manny attends x classes at $6 per class and (10 - x) classes at $10 per class.

Total cost = (6x) + (10(10 - x))

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes twice the number of customers Jewel does in a day. So, Julie's daily production is 50 * 2 = 100 customers.

Julie's weekly production is 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for the two is the sum of their individual weekly productions: 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

"To find the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we need to first find the total amount of flour in one bag and then multiply it by 3.

Since the bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, the total amount of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Now, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3 to find the total amount of flour in three bags: 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Fishio received 2000 likes initially.
2. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. 
   So, the number of likes after 3 weeks = 70 * 2000 = 140000.
3. The total number of likes after 3 weeks is the sum of the initial likes and the likes received in the 3 weeks.
   However, we don't know the number of likes received in the 3 weeks. We only know the number of likes after 3 weeks.
   Since the number of likes after 3 weeks is 140000, and the initial number of likes is 2000, the number of likes received in the 3 weeks is 140000 - 2000 = 138000.
4. Fishio received 20000 more new likes recently.
   So, the total number of likes now = 140000 + 20000 = 160000.

The final answer is: 160000"
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then subtract the two amounts.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got a $2 discount. So, the total cost is:
20 * $20 = $400
$400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, and a 10% discount was offered on the total cost. So, the total cost is:
20 * $30 = $600
10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
$600 - $60 = $540

Now, let's find the difference between the two amounts:
$540 - $398 = $142

The final answer is: $142"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. In the first month, Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Let's denote the total sales from green hats as G. Then, the sales from red hats are 400, and we can write the equation: 400 = 0.5G. Solving for G, we get G = 800.

2. The total sales in the first month are the sum of sales from red and green hats: Total = 400 + 800 = 1200.

3. In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. The total sales in the second month are 3/4 * 1200 = 900.

4. To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales of the first and second months: Total = 1200 + 900 = 2100.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and the total cost of those hours.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The first hour costs $15. Each hour after that costs twice the cost of the first hour, which is 2 * $15 = $30.

So, the total cost is $15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $30 (third hour) = $75.

"To find out how much was withheld from Sally's wage, we need to calculate the difference between her expected wage and the actual amount she received. 

First, let's find out how much she should have had in her account if she received her full wage. 

Her initial balance was $200, and her expected wage is $300. So, her expected balance should be $200 + $300 = $500.

However, her actual balance is $420. To find out how much was withheld, we subtract her actual balance from her expected balance: $500 - $420 = $80.

So, $80 was withheld from Sally's wage.

"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori's guests will eat, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3
Total deviled egg halves: 16 * 3 = 48

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves make up a dozen eggs. 

1 dozen eggs = 12 eggs
1 dozen eggs = 2 * 6 deviled egg halves (since 1 egg makes 2 deviled egg halves)
1 dozen eggs = 12 deviled egg halves

Now, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs to make 48 deviled egg halves.

48 deviled egg halves / 12 deviled egg halves per dozen = 4

So, Lori needs 4 dozens of eggs."

"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the cost of renting the hanger, and the cost of fuel.

The cost of the plane itself is $150,000.

The cost of renting the hanger is $5000 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost of renting the hanger for the first year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The cost of fuel is twice as much as the cost of renting the hanger, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total cost of fuel for the first year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

The total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year is the sum of the cost of the plane, the cost of renting the hanger, and the cost of fuel: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can set up the following equation for the total number of legs: 
4S + 2G = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, so we can set up the following equation: 
S + G = 20

We can solve the second equation for G: 
G = 20 - S

Now, substitute G in the first equation: 
4S + 2(20 - S) = 70

Expand the equation: 
4S + 40 - 2S = 70

Combine like terms: 
2S + 40 = 70

Subtract 40 from both sides: 
2S = 30

Divide both sides by 2: 
S = 15

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut. 

First, let's find the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he needs 7 pounds for a week (7 days). 

The cost of the more expensive coffee is 7 * $6 = $42. 
The cost of the donut is $2.

The total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Kassidy and Rayna have. 

Since Aurelia has $120, and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * 120
Kassidy's money = 90

Now, we know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:
Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + 60
Rayna's money = 90 + 60
Rayna's money = 150

Now, we have the money of all three: Aurelia ($120), Kassidy ($90), and Rayna ($150). To find out how much they would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them, we need to add their money and divide by 3.

Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = 120 + 90 + 150
Total money = 360

Now, let's divide the total money by 3 to find out how much each would have:

"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to first determine what ""twice the number of books that Sally has"" means. Let's call the number of books Sally has ""x"". 

""Twice the number of books that Sally has"" would be 2x. 

Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has, we can write an equation: 

Janey's books = 2x + 3 

We know Janey has 21 books, so we can set up the equation: 

21 = 2x + 3 

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation: 

21 - 3 = 2x + 3 - 3 
18 = 2x 

Next, we need to get x by itself. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2: 

18 / 2 = 2x / 2 
9 = x 

So Sally has 9 books.

3. When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs.
   Total dogs now: 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (initial additional dogs) + 16 (new dogs) = 28 dogs
   Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 28 more toys.
   Total toys needed so far: 12 (previous toys) + 28 (new toys) = 40 toys
4. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys.

"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. 

Since there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, we have two equations based on the given information:

1. The sum of the ages of the twins and the triplet is 44: T + (T+7) + t = 44
2. The age of the older twin is 7 years more than the age of the younger twin: T+7 = T + 7

We can simplify the second equation to find the age of the younger twin. However, we can also use the first equation to find the age of the triplet and then use that information to find the age of the younger twin.

Let's simplify the first equation: 
T + T + 7 + t = 44
Combine like terms: 
2T + 7 + t = 44

Now, let's solve the second equation for T: 
T + 7 = T + 7
Subtract T from both sides: 
7 = 7
This equation is true for any value of T, but we can use the first equation to find the value of T.

Now, let's rewrite the first equation as: 
2T + t = 44 - 7
2T + t = 37

Since we have two variables and one equation, we need more information. However, we can use the fact that the age of the older twin is 7 years more than the age of the younger twin to find the age of the triplet. 

Let's rewrite the first equation as: 
T + (T+7) + t = 44
Combine like terms: 
2T + 7 + t = 44
Subtract 7 from both sides: 
2T + t = 37

Now, let's rewrite the equation as: 
2T + t = 37
Subtract T from both sides: 
T + t = 37
Subtract 7 from both sides: 
T + t - 7 = 30
(T + t) - 7 = 30
(T + t) - (T + 7) = 30
t - 7 = 30
Add 7 to both sides: 
t = 37

Now that we have the age of the triplet, we can find the age of the younger twin. 
2T + t = 37
Substitute t = 37 into the equation:

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

We know that 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, the cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2. 

Now, we subtract the cost of 5 lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of 4 candies: $3.20 - $2 = $1.20. 

The cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops: 10 * $0.40 = $4.

The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4 + $3 = $7.

"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year) and 10 (the number of years).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 coins more than Rong. 
So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year: 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year: 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings: 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings: 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, but we don't know the total bill yet. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check is $40 + $60 = $100.

John brought $125 with him. He leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

Now, subtract this from the total percentage used by the city to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes:
40% - 32% = 8%

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to first calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks would be 7 * 2 = 14 days.

Since Alex charges $12 per day, we multiply the total number of days by her daily rate:

14 days * $12/day = $168

The final answer is: $168"
"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each type of ice cream and then add them together.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find the production rate per hour, we divide 100 quarts by 2 hours:

100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour (chocolate)

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find the production rate per hour, we divide 50 quarts by 4 hours:

50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour (vanilla)

Now, we need to find the total production rate per hour for both types of ice cream:

50 quarts per hour (chocolate) + 12.5 quarts per hour (vanilla) = 62.5 quarts per hour

To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we multiply the total production rate per hour by 48:

62.5 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 3000 quarts

The final answer is: 3000"
"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the discount.

Cost of croissants: 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
Cost of cinnamon rolls: 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
Cost of mini quiches: 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
Cost of blueberry muffins: 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Total cost before discount: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Discount: 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Total bill after discount: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00. 

Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy. 

$6.00 / $1.50 = 4

However, Erin can get 1 free scoop for every 2 scoops she buys. So, for every 3 scoops, she pays for 2 and gets 1 free. 

To maximize the number of free scoops, Erin should buy 6 scoops (2 sets of 3 scoops). 

6 scoops (2 sets of 3) will cost her 2 * $1.50 = $3.00. 

She will get 2 free scoops, making a total of 8 scoops.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of pieces they eat in two weeks and subtract that from their initial amount.

There are 7 days in a week, so two weeks is 14 days. 

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total area that Mr. Boarden needs to cover, we need to calculate two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom. 

Two-thirds of 36 is calculated as (2/3) * 36 = 24.

So, Mr. Boarden needs to cover 24 sq ft. 

For every square foot, he needs 24 mosaic tiles. Therefore, for 24 sq ft, he would need 24 * 24 = 576 mosaic tiles.

The final answer is: 576"
"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store and compare it to the cost of picking them.

The cost of picking blueberries is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $20 + $45 = $65.

The cost of buying blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $75.

The difference in cost is $75 (store price) - $65 (picking price) = $10.

James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself.

The final answer is: $10"
"To find the new price of each computer, we need to calculate 10% of the original price and add it to the original price.

Original price per computer = $700
Increase in price = 10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70
New price per computer = Original price + Increase in price = $700 + $70 = $770

Now, we can find the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices.

Total number of computers = 500
Total amount paid = New price per computer * Total number of computers = $770 * 500 = $385,000

The final answer is: $385,000"

"To find out how many kilograms of rice Goldy gave to her cousin and brother, we need to first find out how many sacks she gave away in total. 

Goldy gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother, so the total number of sacks she gave away is 3 + 4 = 7 sacks.

Since each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice, we multiply the total number of sacks given away by the weight of each sack: 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms.

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how many more boxes of cereal Castle bought this week than last week, we need to first find out the total number of boxes she bought this week and last week. 

This week, Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops. So, the total number of boxes she bought this week is 3 + 5 = 8.

Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

Now, to find out how many more boxes she bought this week than last week, we subtract the number of boxes she bought last week from the number of boxes she bought this week: 8 - 4 = 4.

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the number of taps for both scenarios (with arms down and with arms up) and add them together.

With arms down, Helga taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. The total number of taps per minute is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute. Since she dances with her arms down for 3 minutes, the total number of taps is 550 * 3 = 1650.

With arms up, Helga taps her right foot at 200 taps per minute and her left foot at 200 taps per minute. The total number of taps per minute is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute. Since she dances with her arms up for 2 minutes, the total number of taps is 400 * 2 = 800.

The total number of taps is 1650 + 800 = 2450.

"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and subtract it from the potential damage to his car.

The potential damage to his car is $450.

The cost of fixing the pothole includes the fine for unauthorized road maintenance, which is $120, and the cost of 3 buckets of asphalt, which is 3 * $25 = $75.

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $120 + $75 = $195.

Now, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage to his car: $450 - $195 = $255.

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.

Total normal chairs initially = 170
Total baby chairs initially = 23
Total chairs initially = 170 + 23 = 193

Normal chairs sent for repair = 20
Baby chairs sent for repair = 13
Total chairs sent for repair = 20 + 13 = 33

Total chairs left = Total chairs initially - Total chairs sent for repair
Total chairs left = 193 - 33
Total chairs left = 160

"To find the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends, we first need to find out how many slices they ate in total. Since there are 5 people in total, and 3 of them ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

3 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 3 * 8 = 24 slices

Now, let's find out how many slices the two remaining friends ate. They ate 3/4 of their pizzas, which is equivalent to 9/4 or 2.25. Since there are 12 slices in a pizza, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

2 people * 2.25 * 12 slices/person = 2 * 27 = 54 slices

However, since 2.25 pizzas is more than a whole pizza, we need to calculate the slices from the whole pizza and the remaining fraction. 

2 people * 9 * 12 slices/person = 2 * 108 = 216 slices
2 people * 3 * 12 slices/person = 2 * 36 = 72 slices

Now we add the slices from the whole pizza and the remaining fraction to get the total number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends.

216 + 72 = 288 slices

Now we add the slices eaten by the two groups to get the total number of slices eaten.

24 + 288 = 312 slices

Since there were 5 people and each person ordered 1 pizza, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60 slices.

Now we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices to get the number of slices left.

60 - 312 = -252 slices

However, since we cannot have a negative number of slices, we need to recalculate the total number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends. 

2 people * 9 * 12 slices/person = 2 * 108 = 216 slices
2 people * 3 * 12 slices/person = 2 * 36 = 72 slices
2 people * 0.25 * 12 slices/person = 2 * 3 = 6 slices

Now we add the slices from the whole pizza and the remaining fraction to get the total number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends.

216 + 72 + 6 = 294 slices

Now we add the slices eaten by the two groups to get the total number of slices eaten.

24 + 294 = 318 slices

"To find the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages, we need to multiply the time it takes for the cat by 2/3. 

Time taken by cat = 30 minutes
Time taken by dog = (2/3) * 30 minutes = 20 minutes

Now, we need to find the average time taken by both the cat and the dog. 

Average time = (Time taken by cat + Time taken by dog) / 2
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, we get 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. We can write the equation as:

100 = 9x + 10

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us:

90 = 9x

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us:

x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches. 

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we need to calculate the number of windows from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each. A quarter of the students' cars' windows are smashed, which is 1/4 * 64 = 16 cars. Since each car has 4 windows, the total number of windows from students' cars is 16 * 4 = 64.

Next, let's find the number of windows from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each. Three-fourths of the teachers' cars' windows are smashed, which is 3/4 * 32 = 24 cars. Since each car has 2 windows, the total number of windows from teachers' cars is 24 * 2 = 48.

Now, let's add the number of windows from students' cars and teachers' cars to find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah. 64 + 48 = 112.

"To find the total number of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools. 

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Next, we need to find the total number of spools. 

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 and subtract that from the total number of people.

At 8:00, 2/5 of 5000 people had voted by midday. 
2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by midday.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
The number of people remaining after midday is 5000 - 2000 = 3000.
2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people voted by 16:00.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is the total number of people minus the number of people who voted by 16:00.
5000 - (2000 + 2000) = 5000 - 4000 = 1000

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days and then divide that by the number of pieces in a pack.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. In 30 days, he will chew 4 * 30 = 120 pieces of gum.

A pack of gum has 15 pieces of chewing gum per pack. To find out how many packs Parker will need, we divide the total number of pieces he will chew (120) by the number of pieces in a pack (15).

120 / 15 = 8

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To find out how many boxes of graham crackers are needed, we first need to calculate the total number of smores required.

9 kids want 2 smores each, so the total number of smores for kids is 9 * 2 = 18.
6 adults will eat 1 s'more each, so the total number of smores for adults is 6 * 1 = 6.
The total number of smores required is 18 (for kids) + 6 (for adults) = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 smores, we need to divide the total number of smores by 8 to find out how many sleeves are needed: 24 / 8 = 3.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the total number of sleeves needed by 3 to find out how many boxes are required: 3 / 3 = 1.

Therefore, they will need 1 box of graham crackers.

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first find their individual ages.

Dora's age is given as 15 years.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8 
= 2 * 15 + 8 
= 30 + 8 
= 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
So, Dora's mother's age = Dora's father's age - 4 
= 38 - 4 
= 34 years.

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.
Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age 
= 15 + 38 + 34 
= 87 years.

"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to find the total number of girls in both classes. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, and there are 80 students in total, we can set up an equation to find the number of students in each class.

Let x be the number of students in each class. Then, 2x = 80 (since there are two classes).

Solving for x, we get x = 80 / 2 = 40.

Now that we know there are 40 students in each class, we can find the number of girls in each class. 40% of 40 is 0.4 * 40 = 16 girls in each class.

Since there are 40 students in each class, and 16 are girls, the number of boys in each class is 40 - 16 = 24.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

1. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
   90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading small stickers.

2. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
   50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   Since each large sticker is worth one large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.

3. She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
   She had 40 large stickers initially and traded 20 for large buttons, so she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
   Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers from trading large stickers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has:
- Small buttons: 27 (from trading small stickers) + 60 (from trading large stickers) = 87 small buttons

1. The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250.
2. The first house needs 1/2 of what the second house needs.
3. The third house needs double what the first house needs.

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as x. Then, the first house needs x/2 cases, and the third house needs 2*(x/2) = x cases.

Since the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250, we can set up the equation:

x + (x/2) + x = 250

To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms:

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold. 

20 (vanilla scents sold) - 16 (fruity scents sold) = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we first need to calculate how much money he makes from selling the eggplants. 

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount he makes from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he already makes $60 from eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

He has 25 ears of corn, so to find out how much he should sell each ear for, we divide the total amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25). 

$75 / 25 = $3.

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total time Tatiana has available, we add the hours on Saturday and Sunday: 7 hours + 5 hours = 12 hours.

She reads for 3 hours, so we subtract that from the total time: 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours.

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, so we find 1/3 of 9 hours: 9 hours * (1/3) = 3 hours.

Now, we subtract the time spent reading and playing video games from the total time to find the time spent playing soccer: 9 hours - 3 hours - 3 hours = 3 hours.

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time and multiply by 100: (3 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps of the problem.

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils and gave 1/2 of them to Brandon. 
   1/2 of 50 is 50 * 0.5 = 25 pencils given to Brandon.
   So, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

2. Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie.
   3/5 of 25 is 25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils given to Charlie.
   So, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at 75 mph. So, the time it takes to drive to the museum is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since he drives back, the total driving time is 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours.

Adding the time he spends at the museum (6 hours), the total time Jack is gone from home is:

Total time = Driving time + Time at the museum
Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 10 hours

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of wheels needed for the toys, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles separately and then add them together.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each of the 57 cars, so the total number of wheels needed for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each of the 73 motorcycles, so the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146.

The total number of wheels needed for both the cars and the motorcycles is 228 + 146 = 374.

Since Henry has a box with 650 wheels in it, the number of wheels left after assembling all the toys is 650 - 374 = 276.

The final answer is: 276"
"To find the discount amount, we need to calculate 20% of the original price of the laptop, which is $1000.

20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the final price:

$1000 - $200 = $800

So, you have to pay $800."
"To find the cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to calculate the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so we multiply 600 by 1/3:
600 * (1/3) = 200 movies in series

Since Mike can buy the series for $6, the cost of the series is $6.

Next, let's find the number of remaining movies. We subtract the movies in series from the total number of movies:
600 - 200 = 400 remaining movies

40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we multiply 400 by 0.4:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

The cost of the older movies is $5 each, so the total cost of the older movies is:
160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are not in series and are not older movies, so they are normal movies. There are 400 - 160 = 240 normal movies.

The cost of the normal movies is $10 each, so the total cost of the normal movies is:
240 * $10 = $2400

The total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection is the sum of the cost of the series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies:
$6 + $800 + $2400 = $3206

The final answer is: $3206"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of peaches is 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
The cost of plums is 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, we add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To find the distance the Llesis family drove, we need to calculate their speed when hiking and then multiply it by the time they spent hiking. 

First, let's find their hiking speed. They drove at 50 miles per hour, and their hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, we multiply their hiking speed by the time they spent hiking: 20 miles per hour * 1.5 hours = 30 miles.

Since they drove for 6 hours and hiked for 1.5 hours, the total time they spent traveling is 6 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours.

We know their driving speed is 50 miles per hour, so we can multiply this by the total time they spent driving to find the distance they drove: 50 miles per hour * 6 hours = 300 miles.

However, we also know that the total distance they traveled is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked. Since we already know the distance they hiked (30 miles), we can set up an equation to find the total distance: distance = distance driven + distance hiked. 

distance = 300 miles + 30 miles
distance = 330 miles

The final answer is: 330"
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the scores of Ava and Emma separately and then find the difference.

Let's assume Emma's score is x. 

Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's enemy score is x + 8. 
Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, Ava's berry score is x + 3.
Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, Ava's timer score is (60 - (x + 4)) because the timer starts at 60 seconds.

Emma's total score is x + (number of enemies Emma jumps on) + (number of berries Emma collects) + (timer score of Emma) = x + 0 + 0 + (60 - x) = 60.

Ava's total score is (x + 8) + (x + 3) + (60 - (x + 4)) = x + 8 + x + 3 + 60 - x - 4 = 2x + 7.

The difference between their scores is (2x + 7) - 60 = 2x - 53.

However, we don't know the value of x. We need to find the minimum value of x for which Ava's score is higher than Emma's score. 

Since Emma's score is 60, Ava's score must be higher than 60. So, 2x + 7 > 60. 
2x > 53
x > 26.5

Since x must be an integer (you can't have a fraction of an enemy or a berry), the minimum value of x is 27.

Now we can find the difference in their scores: 
2(27) - 53 = 54 - 53 = 1.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to find the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. 

Two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, so the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 x 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the cost of the other two pizzas. 

Total cost of all four pizzas = 64 dollars
Cost of the two known pizzas = 60 dollars
Cost of the other two pizzas = Total cost of all four pizzas - Cost of the two known pizzas
Cost of the other two pizzas = 64 - 60
Cost of the other two pizzas = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the cost by 2 to find the cost of one pizza.

Cost of one pizza = Cost of the other two pizzas / 2
Cost of one pizza = 4 / 2
Cost of one pizza = 2 dollars

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

The total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is the sum of the times they ride on usual days and the times they ride on the extra days, which is 15 + 12 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's break down the information given:

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.

After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. The number of orange fish he bought would then be 2x (since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish).

The total number of fish in the pet store tank was 17, and this includes both white and orange fish. Since Bob bought all the fish from the tank, the total number of fish he bought is 17.

The total number of fish in Bob's pond after buying more fish is 7 (initial fish) + 17 (bought fish) = 24.

The number of white fish in Bob's pond after buying more fish is 4 (initial white fish) + x (white fish bought).

The number of orange fish in Bob's pond after buying more fish is 3 (initial orange fish) + 2x (orange fish bought).

Since the total number of fish in the pond is 24, we can set up the equation:

4 + x + 3 + 2x = 24

Combine like terms:

3x + 7 = 24

Subtract 7 from both sides:

3x = 17

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 17/3

x = 5.67

Since the number of fish must be a whole number, and we are dealing with a real-world scenario where you can't buy a fraction of a fish, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of white fish Bob bought, and we know that the total number of fish he bought is 17. We can set up another equation using the total number of fish bought:

x + 2x = 17

Combine like terms:

3x = 17

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 17/3

x = 5.67

However, we can also set up an equation using the fact that the total number of fish in the pond is 24 and the ratio of orange to white fish is 2:1.

Let's denote the number of white fish as 4 + x. The number of orange fish is 3 + 2x. The ratio of orange to white fish is 2:1, so we can set up the equation:

(3 + 2x) / (4 + x) = 2/1

Cross-multiply:

3 + 2x = 2(4 + x)

Expand:

3 + 2x = 8 + 2x

Subtract 2x from both sides:

3 = 8

This equation is not solvable, which means our initial assumption that x = 5.67 is incorrect. Let's re-examine the problem.

We know that the total number of fish in the pond is 24, and the ratio of orange to white fish is 2:1. Let's denote the number of white fish as 4 + x. The number of orange fish is 3 + 2x. The total number of fish is 24, so we can set up the equation:

"To calculate the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total miles driven per week and the total gallons of gas consumed per week.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per week:
- Distance between home and office: 5 miles (one way)
- Since Andy drives to and from work, the total distance per day is: 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles
- Total miles driven per week: 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles/week

Next, let's calculate the total gallons of gas consumed per week:
- Fuel efficiency: 10 MPG
- Total miles driven per week: 50 miles
- Total gallons of gas consumed per week: 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week

Now, let's calculate the total money spent on gas per week:
- Price of gas: $3/gallon
- Total gallons of gas consumed per week: 5 gallons
- Total money spent on gas per week: 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15/week

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent, then add them together.

The value of the quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

The value of the twenties is 10 * $20 = $200. Since she spent 3/5 of the twenties, the amount she spent is 3/5 * $200 = $120.

The total amount of money she spent is $35 + $120 = $155.

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants: 110 + 32 = 142

The final answer is: 142"
"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to find the total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 or 0.25. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 or 0.125.

The total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 0.25 + 0.125 = 0.375.

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the total percentage of smart and analog TVs from 1 (which represents 100% of the total TVs sold). 
1 - 0.375 = 0.625.

Now, we multiply the total number of TVs sold (40) by the percentage of OLED TVs sold (0.625).
0.625 * 40 = 25

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first determine how much the school will cover. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, and the trip costs $300, the school will cover $300 / 2 = $150.

John has $50, so to find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the amount the school will not cover. The school is covering $150, so they will not cover $300 - $150 = $150. Since John has $50, he is missing $150 - $50 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature at night. Since it's 33 degrees colder during the night, we subtract 33 from the daytime temperature of 45.

Nighttime temperature = 45 - 33 = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, we need to find out how many degrees the temperature needs to rise to prevent freezing. 

Temperature needed to rise = 12 - 32 = -20 degrees (this is incorrect, we need to find the difference between the current temperature and the freezing point)

Temperature needed to rise = 32 - 12 = 20 degrees

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we need to divide the temperature needed to rise by the amount each log heats up.

Number of logs needed = Temperature needed to rise / Temperature each log heats up
= 20 / 5
= 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of seashells, we first need to find the number of groups and then the number of groups that brought back seashells. 

First, we find the number of groups: 
Number of people = 90
Number of people per group = 9
Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Next, we find the number of groups that brought back seashells:
Fraction of groups that brought back seashells = 3/5
Number of groups that brought back seashells = Number of groups * Fraction of groups that brought back seashells
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 6

Now, we find the total number of seashells:
Number of seashells per group = 2
Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total number of seashells = 6 * 2
Total number of seashells = 12

The final answer is: 12"

Initial number of people: 172
People who got off at the first stop: 47
People who got on at the first stop: 13

Number of people after the first stop: 172 - 47 + 13 = 138

Now, we subtract the number of people who got off at the next stop from the number of people after the first stop.

Number of people after the second stop: 138 - 38 = 100

The final number of people on the train is 100."

"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial pay rate is $10 per hour. After 2 months, he gets a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new pay rate $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. On his first anniversary, he gets another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final pay rate $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, so her starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. 

Now, let's calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours:

Billy's total earnings = (10 * 2) + (10.50 * 18) + (11.50 * 0) = 20 + 189 + 0 = 209 dollars
Sally's total earnings = (10.50 * 2) + (11 * 18) = 21 + 198 = 219 dollars

The difference in their earnings is 219 - 209 = 10 dollars.

The final answer is: 428"
"To find the total number of trees planted by the students, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of students per class and then multiply the result by 1 (since each student plants 1 tree).

Total students = 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students
Total trees planted by students = 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

To find the total number of trees planted by the teachers, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of teachers per class and then multiply the result by 2 (since each teacher plants 2 trees).

Total teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers
Total trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal together. 

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Now, we need to find out how many stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage of stuffed goats 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Let's assume the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy is x.

The total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats will be 14 + x.

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. This can be represented as:

( x / (14 + x) ) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get:

x * 100 = 30 * (14 + x)

Now, we can expand the right side:

100x = 420 + 30x

Subtract 30x from both sides:

70x = 420

Now, divide both sides by 70:

x = 420 / 70
x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats."
"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in 2 weeks and 1 week.

In 2 weeks, there are 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in 2 weeks.

In 1 week, there are 7 days. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in 1 week.

Total hours Kris has played = 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours. 

So, the hours she still needs to play = 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 70 miles/hour x 2 hours = 140 miles

Since the second car was initially passing the first car, we need to find the distance between them after 2 hours. The second car has traveled 20 miles more than the first car in 2 hours (140 - 120 = 20 miles). 

So, the distance between the two cars after 2 hours will be 20 miles.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340, and the total number of third-graders is 500. 

The number of fourth-graders who passed is 40, and the total number of fourth-graders is 100.

The number of fifth-graders who passed is twice the number of fourth-graders who passed, which is 2 * 40 = 80. The total number of fifth-graders is 400.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school:
Total students who passed = 340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460
Total students in the school = 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students in the school, multiplied by 100 to convert it to a percentage:
Overall pass rate = (460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%

The final answer is: 46"
"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to determine how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and he has 2 bags of glass chips, we need to find out how many chips he has in total. 

Each bag holds 72 chips, so 2 bags will hold 2 x 72 = 144 chips.

Now, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of chips needed to make one square inch of the mosaic. 

144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches.

Since the mosaic is three inches tall, and it's a square mosaic, we need to find the length of the mosaic. 

To do this, we need to find the square root of the total square inches of the mosaic. 

Square root of 12 square inches = √12 ≈ 3.46 inches.

However, since the question asks for the length of the mosaic, we need to consider the width of the mosaic as well. Since the height is 3 inches, and it's a square mosaic, the width will also be 3 inches.

So, the length of the mosaic will be the square root of the total square inches, which is approximately 3.46 inches. However, since the width is 3 inches, the length will be the square root of 12, which is approximately 3.46 inches."
"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount of tea each group of students drank and add them together.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea they drank is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea they drank is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea consumed from quarts to gallons by dividing by 4: 38 / 4 = 9.5 gallons.

However, the question asks for the amount of tea at the beginning of the party. We know that 38 quarts were consumed, and there are 10 quarts left. So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4: 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to first determine how many candies he has in total. 

Dale initially ordered 100 candies and then sold 150. So, he had 100 - 150 = -50 candies left. However, this is not possible since you can't have a negative number of candies. This means that Dale must have ordered more candies to replace the ones he sold. 

Dale then ordered 100 more candies. So, he now has 100 (initial candies) + 100 (additional candies) = 200 candies.

Since he sold 150 candies, he still needs to sell 200 - 150 = 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the number of students at the end of May, we need to calculate the number of times the initial number of students doubles from January to May.

January: 10 students (initial)
February: 10 * 2 = 20 students
March: 20 * 2 = 40 students
April: 40 * 2 = 80 students
May: 80 * 2 = 160 students

The number of students at the end of May is 160. To find the number of additional students, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May.

Additional students = 160 - 10 = 150

The final answer is: 150"

Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (5 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 x 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 x 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used and the ones dropped from the initial number of marshmallows. 

John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores. This means they used 18 marshmallows. 

They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. 

So, the total number of marshmallows used or dropped is 18 + 3 = 21.

Now, we subtract the total number of marshmallows used or dropped from the initial number of marshmallows: 35 - 21 = 14.

Since there are 14 marshmallows left, and there are two kids, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many each kid can have: 14 / 2 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the total time played by each person and then multiply it by the cost per minute. 

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. 
Two of his friends can play for half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. 
One of his friends can play for 1.5 times as long, so they can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter.

The total time played is 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Jack's time: 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters
Two friends' time: 240 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters
Better friend's time: 240 minutes / 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters

Total quarters used = 12 + 24 + 8 = 44 quarters

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total amount of money used is 44 * 0.25 = $11.

The final answer is: $11"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces.
- The amount of citrus zest is equal to the amount of fragrance.
- The amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x. Then the amount of salt (and sugar) is 2x, and the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total amount of the mixture is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: x (citrus zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces.

Combine like terms: 8x = 10.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 10 / 8 = 1.25.

Now that we know x, we can find the amount of oil: 4x = 4 * 1.25 = 5 ounces.

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars. So, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

3. He gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

4. In total, Joe sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars. So, he gave away a total of 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

5. To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the total number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

The cost of shipping is calculated as follows:
- Cost per pound: $0.35
- Weight of the book: 4 pounds
- Cost per mile: $0.08
- Distance: 20 miles
- Total cost of shipping: (0.35 * 4) + (0.08 * 20) = 1.40 + 1.60 = $2.99

The refund amount is 75% of the purchase price:
- Purchase price: $32
- Refund amount: 0.75 * 32 = $24

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:
- Total cost of shipping: $2.99
- Refund amount: $24
- Total loss: 2.99 + (32 - 24) = 2.99 + 8 = $10.99

The final answer is: $10.99"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Mulan starts with $40.
2. Her father gives her $100, so she now has $40 + $100 = $140.
3. She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of jeans is 2 * $30 = $60.
4. She also buys a bag for $20.
5. The total amount she spent is $60 (jeans) + $20 (bag) = $80.
6. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the total amount she had: $140 - $80 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then determine the remaining production for the fourth week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month, the remaining production for the fourth week is 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends per week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time she spends on TikTok per week:

- 18 videos * 4 minutes per video = 72 minutes for recording videos
- 2 hours = 120 minutes for writing songs
- 15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes for makeup

Total time per week = 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the total time per week by 4:
282 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1128 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
1128 minutes / 60 = 18.8 hours

The final answer is: 18.8"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of the initial installation is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. However, the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier. So, we need to subtract these from the total number of items she has:

- Mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2
- Chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1
- Pictures: 20 - 10 = 10

The number of additional items is 2 mirrors, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item, so the total cost of the additional items is:

2 (mirrors) * $15.00 = $30.00
1 (chandelier) * $15.00 = $15.00
10 (pictures) * $15.00 = $150.00

The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

The total cost is the initial installation cost plus the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324.00"
"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first determine how much money Anthony has. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $20.00 + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $30.00

Now that we know Anthony's savings, we can calculate Roy's savings. Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we can calculate Roy's savings as follows:

Let's first find 40% of Anthony's savings:
40% of $30.00 = 0.4 x $30.00 = $12.00

Now, we add this amount to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings:
Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% of Anthony's savings
Roy's savings = $30.00 + $12.00
Roy's savings = $42.00

So, Roy has saved $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to determine the lifting capacity of each person relative to Pompei. 

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches. 
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches. 
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 
480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total distance traveled by Mason, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours, and then add them together.

Distance = Speed x Time

For the first 4 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles

For the next 6 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, one kangaroo would take 18 hours multiplied by 3, which equals 54 hours.

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means that the time it takes for one turtle to travel across the highway would be twice the time it takes for a kangaroo, which is 54 hours multiplied by 2, equaling 108 hours.

Since there are four turtles, we need to divide the time it takes for one turtle by 4 to find the time it takes for all four turtles. 108 hours divided by 4 equals 27 hours.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we need to determine the number of dishes each person made.

Kora made 20 dishes. 
Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we add up the number of dishes made by each person: 
20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution, and then subtract the amount she still needs to buy the laptop.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Erika has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution: 
$150 (payment) + $80 (mom's contribution) = $230

Since the price of the new laptop is reduced by $200 when she trades in her old laptop, the new price of the laptop is:
$600 - $200 = $400

Now, we know that Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop. So, the total amount of money she has is:
$400 (new price of the laptop) - $50 (amount she still needs) = $350

However, this is the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution. To find out how much money she had in her purse initially, we need to subtract her payment and her mom's contribution from this total amount:
$350 (total amount) - $230 (payment and mom's contribution) = $120

So, Erika had $120 in her purse initially.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the total number of apple slices, we first need to calculate the total number of slices from the large and small apples. 

3 large apples can be sliced into 3 * 5 = 15 slices.
5 small apples can be sliced into 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

Total number of slices = 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to find out how many cows he needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day with the current milk production rate.

The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow. To find out how many cows he needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can divide 25 by 5.

25 liters / 5 liters per cow = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to find out how many more cows he needs to have to reach 5 cows.

5 cows (required) - 3 cows (already have) = 2 cows

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of each used part and subtract it from the original length of the glue stick.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the used part is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6. The length of the used part is 5/6 * 12 = 10 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the used part is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. The length of the used part is 1/3 * 12 = 4 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the used part is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. The length of the used part is 1/2 * 12 = 6 millimeters.

Now, let's calculate the total length of the used parts: 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks is 3 * 12 = 36 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 36 - 20 = 16 millimeters.

"Let's denote your age as 'x'. Since you are three years younger than your brother, your brother's age is x + 3. Your sister is 2 years younger than you, so her age is x - 2.

Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, which is 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of all your ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87.

Combine like terms: x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms again: 5x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 15.6.

Since age cannot be a decimal, we need to re-examine the equation. The error is likely due to the fact that we assumed the ages are whole numbers. Let's re-examine the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87.

Combine like terms: x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms again: 5x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 15.6.

"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs, we need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required and then divide that by the number of glue sticks in each pack.

Total number of students: 27
Number of glue sticks per student: 2
Total number of glue sticks required: 27 * 2 = 54

Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by 8 to find out how many packs are needed:
54 / 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each girl is as follows:

- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:

36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold. 

She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, she baked 2 * 5 = 10 loaves. 

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she baked 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so the total amount she raised is 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to determine the number of silver coins first. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and Gretchen has 70 gold coins, we can set up an equation to find the number of silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. 

The equation would be: x + (x + 30) = 70 (since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins)

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 70

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20

So, Gretchen has 20 silver coins. 

Now, to find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins: 70 (gold coins) + 20 (silver coins) = 90

There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos eaten by the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George ate 20 burritos. 

The total number of burritos eaten is 500 (by students) + 20 (by Mr. George) = 520.

Since George ordered 600 burritos, the total number of leftover burritos is 600 - 520 = 80.

"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first determine the number of green and blue cars. 

The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

The total number of red, green, and blue cars is 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We know that S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
We also know that A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to get S = (F - 12) + 25
S = F + 13

We also know that S + A + F = 85 (Together, they have 85 books)

Substituting the first two equations into the third one, we get (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85
Combine like terms: 2F + 1 = 85
Subtract 1 from both sides: 2F = 84
Divide both sides by 2: F = 42

The final answer is: 42"

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. First, we need to find out how many pieces were left after the first two days. 
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces left.

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26. 
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up the number of pieces he ate each day: 
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda, we need to divide the total cost of 7 bottles of soda by 7 and then multiply by 3. 

Cost of 1 bottle of soda = $21.00 / 7 = $3.00
Cost of 3 bottles of soda = $3.00 * 3 = $9.00

To find the cost of 2 bottles of water, we need to divide the total cost of 4 bottles of water by 4 and then multiply by 2.

Cost of 1 bottle of water = $8.00 / 4 = $2.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = $2.00 * 2 = $4.00

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

Number of chickens to sell = 300 * (3/5)
= 300 * 0.6
= 180 chickens

Since Isaias plans to sell each chicken at $50, the total amount of money he will make from selling the chickens is:

Total money from selling chickens = Number of chickens to sell * Price per chicken
= 180 * $50
= $9000

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, so the total amount of money he needs to spend on buying the chickens is:

Total money spent on chickens = Total money from selling chickens - Profit
= $9000 - $2000
= $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

In 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. This means that her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years old.

Let's denote the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age as 'x'. In 'x' years, Melanie's age will be her current age plus 'x', which is 8 + x.

In 'x' years, her age will also be thrice her current age, which is 3 * 8 = 24.

So, we can set up the equation: 8 + x = 24.

To solve for 'x', we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: x = 24 - 8.

x = 16.

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

"Let's break down the information given. 

Let the runtime of Elaina's usual concert be x minutes. 

The final concert is twice as long as her usual concert, so its runtime is 2x minutes. 

At the end of the concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. 

The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, which is the sum of the runtime of the concert and the encore. 

So, we can write the equation: 2x + 15 = 65.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. 

Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 50 / 2
x = 25

The runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he had initially.

Argo initially had 200 toys. He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. 

First, let's add up the number of toys he gave away: 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys.

Now, let's subtract the number of toys he gave away from the initial number of toys: 200 - 150 = 50.

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

"To find the number of microphones that were arranged in pairs, we first need to find the total number of microphones that were arranged. 

Let's assume the total number of microphones arranged is x. Since 20% of the total microphones couldn't fit, 80% of the total microphones were arranged. 

We know that the total number of microphones is 50. So, 80% of 50 is 0.8 * 50 = 40. 

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs is 40 / 2 = 20.

"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.

Then, 2/3 of 6 is 4, so 2/3rd of the number of birds flying overhead is 4. This means there are 4 birds flying overhead.

Next, Jerry sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we multiply 3 by 8, which is 24.

Now, we add the number of birds in each group together: 6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34.

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which is five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

"To find the cost of one carrot, we need to first find the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, the cost of the yogurt is $6 / 2 = $3.

Now, let's denote the cost of one carrot as 'x'. Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods, which includes 2 carrots, a salad, and a yogurt. So, the equation becomes:

2x + 6 + 3 = 11

Combine the constants:
2x + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides:
2x = 2

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 1

The cost of one carrot is $1."
"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns and then subtract that from the total amount she made. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is the sum of the lawns she mowed in the first and second week, which is 3x + 5x = 8x.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and she mowed his lawn x times, the total amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn is 6x.

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is the sum of the amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn and the amount she made from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns, which is 6x + 3x + 5x = 14x.

We know that the total amount she made from mowing lawns and lemonade sales is $80. Since she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, the amount she made from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns is 80 - 6 = 74.

Since the amount she made from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns is 14x, we can set up the equation 14x = 74.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 14, which gives us x = 74 / 14 = 5.29 (round down to 5 since you can't mow a fraction of a lawn).

Now that we know x = 5, we can find the total amount she made from mowing lawns, which is 14x = 14 * 5 = 70.

The amount she made from lemonade sales is the total amount she made minus the amount she made from mowing lawns, which is 80 - 70 = 10.

Martin's weight is 55 kg.
Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"To find the total amount John earns from renting his car, we need to calculate the total hours he rents his car and multiply it by his hourly rate.

He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so the total hours he rents his car is 10 * 3 = 30 hours.

His hourly rate is $25, so the total amount he earns is 30 * $25 = $750.

However, he has to pay $500 for his car payment. To find the profit, we subtract the car payment from the total amount he earns: $750 - $500 = $250.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Martha initially had some notebooks, but we don't know the exact number. However, we know that after buying 5 more, she had a total of 7 notebooks. This means she initially had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, and Martha initially had 2 notebooks, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. So, Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we first need to determine how many cookies are left after Susan's husband took some. 

Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies, so we subtract 4 from 100: 100 - 4 = 96 cookies left.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. 

96 cookies / 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew.

"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today.

So, Denise's total pages read is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.
Daniel's total pages read is 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is 28 - 13 = 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bowls of soup are left after dinner and then divide that number by the number of child-sized bowls.

Since Calvin, his wife, and their two children are eating dinner, that's a total of 3 adults and 2 children, which equals 5 people. 

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, we can assume that the pot can fill 5 child bowls (since 5 is the average of 4 and 8). 

If everyone eats one bowl at dinner, that means 5 bowls will be used. 

Now, we need to find out how many child-sized bowls can be filled with the leftover soup. Since the pot can fill 8 child-sized bowls, and 5 bowls were used for dinner, there are 8 - 5 = 3 child-sized bowls left.

Since there are 2 children, and there are 3 child-sized bowls left, each child can have 3 / 2 = 1.5 bowls of soup for lunch."

- Total material required for small masks = 20 * 2 = 40 yards.

For large masks: 
- Each large mask requires 2.25 yards of material.
- Jo needs to make 8 large masks.
- Total material required for large masks = 8 * 2.25 = 18 yards.

Total material required = material for small masks + material for large masks = 40 + 18 = 58 yards.

1/3 of 9 is 9 / 3 = 3.

So, Tim used 3 blue shoeboxes and 3 red shoeboxes to go fishing.

Now, let's calculate how many shoeboxes are left. 

Blue shoeboxes left: 7 - 3 = 4
Red shoeboxes left: 9 - 3 = 6

The total number of shoeboxes left is 4 (blue) + 6 (red) = 10."
"To find out how many books Joseph had initially, we need to multiply the number of books Sarah has by 2. 

Sarah has 9 books, so Joseph had 9 * 2 = 18 books initially.

However, Joseph lost 2 books, so we need to subtract 2 from the initial number of books he had.

18 - 2 = 16

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

Dean gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. 1/5 of 30 is 30 / 5 = 6. 

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie. 

Then, he gives 10 marbles to Donald. 

In total, Dean gives away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Dean had 30 marbles initially. After giving away 16 marbles, he has 30 - 16 = 14 marbles left.

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. 

Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write the equation: 
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2x

We know that Duncan's current age is 60, so we can find his age eight years ago by subtracting 8 from 60:
Duncan's age eight years ago = 60 - 8 = 52

Now we can equate the two expressions for Duncan's age eight years ago:
52 = 2x

To find x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:
x = 52 / 2
x = 26

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to x:
Adam's current age = 26 + 4 = 30

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8 = 38

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres of Farmer Smith's farm, we need to calculate twice the number of acres of Farmer Brown's farm and then add 100 to it. 

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres. Adding 100 to that gives us 400 + 100 = 500 acres for Farmer Smith's farm.

Now, we add the number of acres of both farms together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The final answer is: 700"
"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes in that time and then multiply it by the amount he gets paid per package.

Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

In an 8-hour workday, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, he earns 320 * $0.20 = $64 in a typical eight-hour workday.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku and then divide it by the time it takes to drink one bottle of water.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so an extreme sudoku takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to convert the time from minutes to half hours. 180 minutes is equal to 180 / 30 = 6 half hours.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, he drinks 6 bottles of water in 6 half hours.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the red balloons. Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there were 20 red balloons, the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Since Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at the bundle of balloons, and 40 of those were thrown at the red balloons, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons is 18 / 3 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days. 

Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so the total miles driven is 100 * 30 = 3000 miles.

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we need to divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs.

3000 miles / 1000 miles per tune-up = 3 tune-ups.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total hours Bruce works, we need to calculate the hours he works each day and add them up.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

"To find out how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. 1 dozen balloons is equal to 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, 12 balloons will cost 12 * $0.5 = $6.

The total cost of the cake and the balloons is $11 + $6 = $17.

The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is $7 * 2 = $14.

The total amount of money they spent is $17 + $14 = $31.

Since they spent $31 in total, and they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount by 2 to find out how much each of them received.

$31 / 2 = $15.50

The final answer is: $15.50"
"To find out how many pieces of fruit Kira bought in total, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges. 

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit, we need to subtract 2 from the total number of fruits Kira bought.

14 - 2 = 12

So, there are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer, and then add them together.

There are 6 students playing tennis. Since there are twice that number playing volleyball, there are 6 * 2 = 12 students playing volleyball.

There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is 16 + 22 = 38.

Now, we add the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer: 6 + 12 + 38 = 56.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the total number of lollipops sold and the total cost of the lollipops bought.

Each student sold 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students, so the total number of lollipops sold is:
10 lollipops/student * 30 students = 300 lollipops

The total cost of the lollipops bought is:
300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150

The selling price of each lollipop is $0.8, so the total amount of money raised from selling the lollipops is:
300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240

The profit is the difference between the total amount of money raised and the total cost of the lollipops:
Profit = Total amount of money raised - Total cost of lollipops
Profit = $240 - $150
Profit = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

$90"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them together.

Larry has 3 cats.

He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of each type of pet together: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The final answer is: 47"
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices both Abby and Josh can eat per day.

Abby eats 2 slices per day, and Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices per day.

Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices per day.

Since the loaf of bread has 24 slices, we can divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat per day to find out how many days it will last:

24 slices / 6 slices per day = 4 days

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To find out how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and turned 10 years old, she has been collecting shells for 5 years.

There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply the number of years by 12 to find the total number of months:

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, we multiply the total number of months by 1 shell/month:

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday."
"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we first need to determine how many cups of tea are in each row. 

Lana has 27 cups of tea in total. She divides these into 3 rows, so each row will have 27 / 3 = 9 cups of tea.

Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row will be half of the total cups in each row. 

So, the number of mint tea cups in each row is 9 / 2 = 4.5. However, since you can't have half a cup of tea, this is likely a misunderstanding of the problem. 

However, if we assume that the 15 cups of cinnamon tea are in addition to the 3 rows of tea, then the total number of cups of tea is 27 + 15 = 42. 

Now, we can divide the total number of cups by 3 to find the number of cups in each row: 42 / 3 = 14. 

Since the number of mint tea cups in each row is half of the total cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row is 14 / 2 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to first determine how many trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes the sloth 4 hours to make a round trip, he can make 8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips in 8 hours.

Since he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and he makes 2 trips, he needs to collect 24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the amount of water in the tank after 6 days, we need to first determine how much water is initially transferred to the tank from the pool. Since they fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, the initial amount of water in the tank is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Next, we need to calculate how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so over 6 days, 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons of water will be used.

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank, we subtract the amount used from the initial amount: 5000 - 3000 = 1000 gallons.

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find out how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left. 

Colby's monthly budget is $150. He has already spent:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Colby has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10, and he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can see 1 more movie on a Friday or Saturday with the remaining money. 

However, if he wants to see a movie on any other day, he can see 2 more movies with the remaining money, since tickets for other days cost $7.

Therefore, the number of movies he can see is 1 (on a Friday or Saturday) or 2 (on other days)."
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to first find the calories of a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we can find the total calories of the pastries. The total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls is 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories. The total calories of the mini blueberry muffins is 150 * 300 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories of the pastries is 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days = 378 / 5 = 75.6"
"To find out how far each vehicle traveled, we need to multiply their speeds by the time they traveled.

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so it traveled 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so it traveled 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.

The number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and John's age as J. 

We are given the following information:
1. P + Pp + J = 100
2. Pp = J + 10
3. P = Pp + J

From equation 2, we can substitute Pp with J + 10 in equation 1:
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
P + 2J + 10 = 100

From equation 3, we can substitute P with Pp + J:
Pp + J + 2J = 100
Substitute Pp with J + 10:
(J + 10) + J + 2J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 10 = 100

Now, let's solve for J:
4J = 100 - 10
4J = 90
J = 90 / 4
J = 22.5

Now that we have J, we can find Pp:
Pp = J + 10
Pp = 22.5 + 10
Pp = 32.5

Now that we have Pp, we can find P:
P = Pp + J
P = 32.5 + 22.5
P = 55

"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria had 1 balloon, and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each, so the total initial number of balloons is:
1 (Maria's balloon) + 4 * 2 (friends' balloons) = 1 + 8 = 9

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 * 3 = 15

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24

The total number of balloons is 24."
"To find out how many tables they need, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so they have 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. 
They already have 10 boxes, so in total, they have 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

They can fit 2 boxes per table, and they already have 15 tables. To find out how many more tables they need, we need to divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes per table and subtract the number of tables they already have.

60 boxes / 2 boxes per table = 30 tables needed
30 tables needed - 15 tables already owned = 15 tables needed

"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay with the two options and then find the difference.

Option 1: 24-hour stay - 1600 pesos
Option 2: 12-hour stay (1000 pesos) + additional hours

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is 17 hours. Since the first 12 hours are already included in the 1000 pesos, we need to calculate the cost of the additional 5 hours.

5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay with the additional hours is 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's find the difference between the two options:
Difference = 1600 pesos (24-hour stay) - 1350 pesos (12-hour stay with additional hours)
Difference = 250 pesos

Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing the option of adding 70 pesos for every additional hour after the 12-hour mark.

"To find the total time it took James to cross the lake, we need to break down the problem into steps.

1. First, we need to find the distance James swam before stopping. Since he swam 60% of the 20-mile lake, we can calculate this as 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.

2. The time it took James to swim 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

3. Since James rested for half as long as the swimming time, he rested for 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

4. The remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. James swims this distance at half his original speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

5. The time it took James to swim the remaining 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

6. The total time it took James to cross the lake is the sum of the swimming time, the resting time, and the time it took to swim the remaining distance: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Deanna is 26 years old.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.
3. Marcus is half of Leo's age, so Leo's age is twice the age of Marcus. 

To find Leo's age, we multiply Marcus's age by 2: 21 * 2 = 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D. 

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. 

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can set A + 20 = D + 10. 

We also know that B + A + D = 45. 

We can substitute B = A + 20 into the equation B + A + D = 45, which gives us (A + 20) + A + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2A + D + 20 = 45. 

We can also substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B + A + D = 45, which gives us (D + 10) + A + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2D + A + 10 = 45. 

Now we have two equations: 2A + D + 20 = 45 and 2D + A + 10 = 45. 

We can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate A: (2A + D + 20) - (2D + A + 10) = 45 - 45. 

This simplifies to A - D + 10 = 0. 

We can rearrange the equation to get A - D = -10. 

Now we can add D to both sides to get A = D - 10. 

We can substitute A = D - 10 into the equation B = A + 20, which gives us B = (D - 10) + 20. 

This simplifies to B = D + 10. 

We know that B = D + 10 and B + A + D = 45. 

We can substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B + A + D = 45, which gives us (D + 10) + A + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2D + A + 10 = 45. 

We can substitute A = D - 10 into the equation 2D + A + 10 = 45, which gives us 2D + (D - 10) + 10 = 45. 

This simplifies to 3D = 45. 

We can divide both sides by 3 to get D = 15. 

Now that we know D = 15, we can substitute D = 15 into the equation A = D - 10, which gives us A = 15 - 10. 

This simplifies to A = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is 100 pages to the inch and each paper is printed on both sides, we have 200 pages per inch (100 pages per side).

The book is 1.5 inches thick, so we multiply 200 pages per inch by 1.5 inches:

200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked. He worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. 

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the total number of minutes is:
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know that Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the number of reports he staples per minute, we divide 30 by 15:
30 reports / 15 minutes = 2 reports/minute

Now, we multiply the total number of minutes he worked by the number of reports he staples per minute:
900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she slept and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. This is a total of 8 hours, which is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. This means she slept from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m., which is a total of 7 hours and 55 minutes, or 7 * 60 + 55 = 455 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking, which was from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. This is a total of 23 minutes.

So, the total time she slept on her bed that day is 455 - 23 = 432 minutes.

The final answer is: 432"
"To find the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially, we need to first find out how many measuring spoons he has in relation to the measuring cups. 

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen (24) measuring cups, we can find the number of measuring spoons by multiplying 24 by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = 16

So, Jonathan initially has 16 measuring spoons.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with:

16 - 6 = 10

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 10 measuring spoons and 24 measuring cups, which equals 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the number of occupied beds initially, we need to calculate 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital. 

1/5 of 1000 = 100

So, the hospital has 100 occupied beds initially. 

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 14 days. 

Total patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 * 14 = 700

Now, we need to find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks. 

Initial occupied beds = 100
Additional occupied beds = 700
Total occupied beds = 100 + 700 = 800

Now, we need to find the total number of unoccupied beds. 

Total capacity = 1000
Total occupied beds = 800
Total unoccupied beds = 1000 - 800 = 200

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to first find out how many emails are not work-related. 

Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. So, 6 emails are to family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after subtracting the family emails from the non-work emails. 9 - 6 = 3.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.
2. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya.
3. Aliya is 3 years old.

From point 2, we can find Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3:
Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years

From point 1, we can find Shawna's father's age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5:
Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age = 5 * 9 = 45 years

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from the number she reported.

Let's assume the number Courtney reported is 100%. 
20% of 100 is 20.

Now, subtract 20 from 100 to find the actual percentage of people who attended the concert.
100 - 20 = 80%

Now, we need to find 80% of the number Courtney reported, which is 48.
80% of 48 = (80/100) * 48 = 0.8 * 48 = 38.4

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

However, since the number of people cannot be a decimal, we will round it to the nearest whole number. 

The final answer is: 38"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Since Jason carried 2 balls, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey must have carried half of what Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan must have carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

The total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is the same as the total number of balls carried by the three boys, which is 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day, we need to add the holes dug each day and subtract the two holes filled in. 

Day 1: 10 holes
Day 2: 13 holes
Day 3: 8 holes
Total holes before filling in: 10 + 13 + 8 = 31
Holes filled in: 2
Total holes at the end of the third day: 31 - 2 = 29

The island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day, which means it had 4 * 10 = 40 holes by the fourth day. 

Since we know the total number of holes by the fourth day is 40, and we know the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 29, we can find the number of holes dug on the fourth day by subtracting 29 from 40.

Holes dug on the fourth day: 40 - 29 = 11

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 15 more than each of them. 

Since the third person got 15 more than Amora and Lainey, the third person got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips each person got. So, the total number of corn chips is 70 + 70 + 85 = 225.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of travel, we need to first find 50% of the cost of supplies, and then add that to the cost of supplies.

The cost of supplies is $400. 
50% of $400 is 0.5 * 400 = $200.
The cost of travel is 50% more than the cost of supplies, so it is the cost of supplies plus 50% of the cost of supplies, which is $400 + $200 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L. 

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so A + S + L = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so L = S + 5.

We also know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so S = 4A - 13.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one: A + (S + 5) + S = 339.

This simplifies to A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Now we can substitute the third equation into this one: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.

This simplifies to A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.

Combine like terms: 9A - 21 = 339.

Add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Divide by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the southerly direction is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 10 = 300 miles

The bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the northerly direction is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 2 = 36 miles

The bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the southerly direction is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 22 * 5 = 110 miles

The total distance traveled in the southerly direction is 300 + 110 = 410 miles.

Now, subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction:
Distance between homes = Total southerly distance - Northerly distance = 410 - 36 = 374 miles

"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we need to multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form).

Nani's sister's age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together: Nani's age + brother's age + sister's age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).

Given the length of the fence is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first determine how many boxes she had left after giving some to her mom and sister. 

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each, so she gave away a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. 

Now, she had 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left. 

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges in 8 boxes is 8 * 20 = 160 oranges.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges. 

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on both days and then calculate the total earnings.

Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.

We know that on Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so G = 10.

We also know that on Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, and on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. So, A = 15 - 4 = 11.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for both days.

The total earnings from gingerbread on Saturday is 10 * $6 = $60.
The total earnings from apple pie on Saturday is 11 * $15 = $165.
The total earnings from gingerbread on Sunday is 15 * $6 = $90.
The total earnings from apple pie on Sunday is 15 * $15 = $225.

"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use.

Pamela reapplies sunscreen every hour, and she will be outside for 4 hours a day. So, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day. 

Since she will be on vacation for 8 days, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day for 8 days, which is 4 * 8 = 32 times.

Each bottle of sunscreen is 8 ounces, and she uses 1 ounce each time she reapplies. So, she will need 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.

To find out how many bottles she will need, we divide the total amount of sunscreen needed (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces). 

32 / 8 = 4

So, Pamela will need 4 bottles of sunscreen.

1. Emil is 19 years old now.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

From point 3, we can deduce that when Emil is 24, his brother's age will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

From point 2, we know that when Emil is 24, his dad's age will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

Since Emil is 19 now, we need to find his dad's and brother's ages now. 

Dad's current age = 48 - 5 = 43 years old (since Emil will be 24 in 5 years)

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to first convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between each plant, we need to subtract the total space taken up by the gaps from the total length of the flower bed:

1332 inches - (18 inches * number of plants) = 0

However, we know that Pat already owns 17 flowers. Let's assume she buys x more flowers. The total number of plants will be 17 + x. The total space taken up by the gaps will be 18 * (17 + x). We want this to be less than or equal to the total length of the flower bed:

1332 - 18 * (17 + x) >= 0

Simplifying the inequality:

1332 - 306 - 18x >= 0
1026 - 18x >= 0
-18x >= -1026
x <= 57.0

Since x must be a whole number (you can't buy a fraction of a plant), the maximum number of plants Pat can buy is 57. However, this would leave no space for the 17 plants she already owns. So, the maximum number of plants she can buy is 57 - 1 = 56. But this would leave 18 inches of space left over. So, the maximum number of plants she can buy is 56, and she will have 18 inches of space left over.

However, we can also consider the case where Pat buys 57 plants, which would leave 0 inches of space left over. In this case, the total number of plants would be 57 + 17 = 74.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the plants:

Cost = (number of plants - 17) * 6
Cost = (74 - 17) * 6
Cost = 57 * 6
Cost = 342

The cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00
The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Total cost = cost of petunias + cost of sweet potato vines = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers need 4 * 3 = 12 pounds of soil.
10 carnations need 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil.

The total amount of soil used for sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have a 30-pound bag of soil, the remaining soil for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so they can plant 3 / 1 = 3 roses.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate how much she saves each month and then multiply it by 12.

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets 25% of her paycheck aside for shoes. 

25% of $2,000.00 is calculated as 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since she saves $500.00 each month, in a year (12 months) she will save 12 * $500.00 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of shoes she can buy in a year is $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: peeling and cooking.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to cook 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 30 = 3 times 10 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

However, since peeling and cooking are done sequentially, we need to add the time for both tasks. So, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature. 

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

However, the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is not running. Since the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. 

Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, and Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, we can set up the following equation:

x + 75 = 3 * 30

Simplifying the equation, we get:

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and add them together.

1. Checks for the electric bill: 12 months/year * 1 check/month = 12 checks/year
2. Checks for the gas bill: 12 months/year * 1 check/month = 12 checks/year
3. Checks to the church: 12 months/year * 2 checks/month = 24 checks/year
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 quarters/year * 1 check/quarter = 4 checks/year

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's denote the average age as 'x'. 

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, Helene's age is 2x. 

The total age of the group is 20, and we know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro. We can set up an equation to represent the total age of the group:

x + 2x + 3 + 4 = 20

Combine like terms:

3x + 7 = 20

Subtract 7 from both sides:

3x = 13

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 13/3

Now that we know the average age, we can find Helene's age:

Helene's age = 2x = 2 * (13/3) = 26/3

However, we are given that Helene is twice as old as the average age, so we can also express Helene's age as 2x. We can use this information to find the total age of the group in terms of x:

x + 2x + 3 + 4 = 20

We already know that 3x + 7 = 20, so we can use this equation to find the value of x. However, we can also use the fact that Helene is twice as old as the average age to find the value of x. We know that Helene's age is 26/3, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 26/3

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 13/3

Now that we know the average age, we can find the total age of the group:

Total age = x + 2x + 3 + 4
= 3x + 7
= 3(13/3) + 7
= 13 + 7
= 20

We can also find the total age of the group by adding the ages of Akbar and Alessandro to Helene's age:

Total age = 3 + 4 + 26/3
= 7 + 26/3
= (21 + 26)/3
= 47/3

Since the total age of the group is 20, we can set up the equation:

(21 + 26)/3 = 20

Multiply both sides by 3:

47/3 = 20

Multiply both sides by 3:

47 = 60

This is incorrect, so we will use the equation 3x + 7 = 20 to find the value of x. We can solve for x by subtracting 7 from both sides:

3x = 20 - 7
3x = 13

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 13/3

Now that we know the average age, we can find Helene's age:

Helene's age = 2x = 2 * (13/3) = 26/3

We can also find the total age of the group by adding the ages of Akbar and Alessandro to Helene's age:

Total age = 3 + 4 + 26/3
= 7 + 26/3
= (21 + 26)/3
= 47/3

Since the total age of the group is 20, we can set up the equation:

(21 + 26)/3 = 20

Multiply both sides by 3:

47/3 = 20

Multiply both sides by 3:

47 = 60

This is incorrect, so we will use the equation 3x + 7 = 20 to find the value of x. We can solve for x by subtracting 7 from both sides:

3x = 20 - 7
3x = 13

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 13/3

Now that we know the average age, we can find Helene's age:

Helene's age = 2x = 2 * (13/3) = 26/3

We can also find the total age of the group by adding the ages of Akbar and Alessandro to Helene's age:

Total age = 3 + 4 + 26/3
= 7 + 26/3
= (21 + 26)/3
= 47/3

Since the total age of the group is 20, we can set up the equation:

(21 + 26)/3 = 20

Multiply both sides by 3:

47/3 = 20

Multiply both sides by 3:

47 = 60

This is incorrect, so we will use the equation 3x + 7 = 20 to find the value of x. We can solve for x by subtracting 7 from both sides:

3x = 20 - 7
3x = 13

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 13/3

Now that we know the average age, we can find Helene's age:

Helene's age = 2x = 2 * (13/3) = 26/3

We can also find the total age of the group by adding the ages of Akbar and Alessandro to Helene's age:

Total age = 3 + 4 + 26/3
= 7 + 26/3
= (21 + 26)/3
= 47/3

Since the total age of the group is 20, we can set up the equation:

(21 + 26)/3 = 20

Multiply both sides by 3:

47/3 = 20

Multiply both sides by 3:

47 = 60

This is incorrect, so we will use the equation 3x + 7 = 20 to find the value of x. We can solve for x by subtracting 7 from both sides:

3x = 20 - 7
3x = 13

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 13/3

Now that we know the average age, we can find Helene's age:

Helene's age = 2x = 2 * (13/3) = 26/3

We can also find the total age of the group by adding the ages of Akbar and Alessandro to Helene's age:

Total age = 3 + 4 + 26/3
= 7 + 26/3
= (21 + 26)/3
= 47/3

Since the total age of the group is 20, we can set up the equation:

(21 + 26)/3 = 20

Multiply both sides by 3:

47/3 = 20

Multiply both sides by 3:

47 = 60

"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected by Walter before his friend donates $200. 

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from a fund he set up online. So, the total amount collected is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's friend donates $200, but this is not included in the amount that Walter's lawyer will base his donation on. The lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates, excluding Walter's friend. 

So, the amount the lawyer will donate is 3 * ($500 + $1500) = 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to first find out the total number of cookies. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church, so the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 * 1/2 = 750.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, the number of people in the church is 750 / 15 = 50.

"To solve this problem, let's assume the total number of slices of the watermelon is 100. 

Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid, let's say each kid gets 1 slice. Then each adult would get 2 slices.

The total number of slices the adults get is 2 * 2 = 4 slices. 

The total number of slices the kids get is 4 * 1 = 4 slices.

The total number of slices is 4 (adults) + 4 (kids) = 8 slices.

The percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (4/8) * 100 = 50%.

"To find out how much time Doctor Jones will spend on rounds, we need to multiply the number of inpatients by the time spent per inpatient. 

9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on appointments. 

10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Converting 300 minutes to hours:

300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

Now, we add the time spent on rounds and appointments to find the total time spent at the clinic.

3 hours (rounds) + 5 hours (appointments) = 8 hours

Since Doctor Jones works 9 hours at the clinic, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours worked to find the time left for updating records.

9 hours (total hours worked) - 8 hours (time spent) = 1 hour

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so together they sold 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together and they sold 8 boxes, we can divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes to find out how many chocolate bars are in a box.

64 / 8 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. So, the total number of sessions in a month is 3 sessions/day * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

3/5 * 50 = 30

So, there are 30 female porcupines in the park.

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

30 * 4 * 12 = 1440

However, these babies are not born at the same time. They are born every month. So, we need to add the number of babies born each month to the total population.

After the first month, the total population will be 50 + 1440 = 1490
After the second month, the total population will be 1490 + 1440 = 2930
After the third month, the total population will be 2930 + 1440 = 4370
After the fourth month, the total population will be 4370 + 1440 = 5810
After the fifth month, the total population will be 5810 + 1440 = 7250
After the sixth month, the total population will be 7250 + 1440 = 8690
After the seventh month, the total population will be 8690 + 1440 = 10130
After the eighth month, the total population will be 10130 + 1440 = 11570
After the ninth month, the total population will be 11570 + 1440 = 13010

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed, we do the following:

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon:

Cost = Gallons * $0.10
Cost = 8260 * $0.10
Cost = $826

"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons. To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we subtract this from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x%.

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is x - 5 * 9 = x - 45%.

After the first 5 hours, the power bank starts losing 7% of its capacity each hour for 3 hours. So, after the additional 3 hours, the charge remaining is (x - 45) - 3 * 7 = x - 45 - 21 = x - 66%.

We are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. We can set up the equation:

x - 66 = 28

To solve for x, we add 66 to both sides of the equation:

x = 28 + 66
x = 94

The initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%."
"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and her hourly tips are $15. So, her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Now, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of the car, which is 20% of $10,000. 

20% of $10,000 is 0.20 * $10,000 = $2000.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save $2000. We can do this by dividing the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000).

$2000 / $1000 = 2

So, Janet will need to work 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate how much money he has left after purchasing the other fruits.

- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he has already purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we first need to find out how many packs she gave to her friends. 

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs to her friends.

Since she gave the packs equally to 10 friends, we divide the number of packs by 10: 13 / 10 = 1.3 packs per friend.

Each pack has 60 pieces, so we multiply the number of packs each friend received by the number of pieces in each pack: 1.3 * 60 = 78.

However, since you can't divide a pack into fractions, we can round down to 1 pack per friend and give the remaining packs to the friends with more than 1 pack. 

So, 13 packs / 10 friends = 1 pack per 7 friends and 6 packs / 3 friends (6 packs left after 7 friends have 1 pack each). 

The 7 friends who received 1 pack each got 1 * 60 = 60 pieces. The 3 friends who received 2 packs each got 2 * 60 = 120 pieces.

So, the 7 friends who received 1 pack each got 60 pieces, and the 3 friends who received 2 packs each got 120 pieces. 

The total number of pieces the 3 friends who received 2 packs each got is 120. The total number of pieces the 7 friends who received 1 pack each got is 60 * 7 = 420. 

The total number of pieces all 10 friends got is 120 + 420 = 540. 

The 3 friends who received 2 packs each got 120 pieces. The 7 friends who received 1 pack each got 420 pieces."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to first find the number of pictures in each album. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures (72) by the number of albums (8) to get the number of pictures in each album.

72 / 8 = 9

So, each album has 9 pictures. 

Since 3 albums were selfies only, the total number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27.

Since 2 albums were portraits, the total number of portraits is 2 * 9 = 18.

The total number of portraits and selfies is 27 + 18 = 45.

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read 3 pages.

Since James reads 18 pages, we divide 18 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pages he reads: 18 / 3 = 6.

Since it takes James 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we multiply the number of sets (6) by the time it takes to read 3 pages (10 minutes): 6 * 10 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, there were 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the remaining guests are 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests who have checked out is 24 + 15 = 39.

The number of guests who have not checked out is 76.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30.

After dinner, 7 more people checked in.

The total number of guests who checked in is 30 + 7 = 37.

The total number of guests who have not checked out is 76 + 37 = 113.

The number of guests who have checked out is 39.

The current number of guests in the hotel is 113 - 39 = 74.

"To find out how many points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of questions in each category and then find out how many she is sure to get in each category.

First, let's find out how many questions are easy, average, and difficult. 

40% of 60 questions are easy: 0.4 * 60 = 24 easy questions
The rest are equally divided as average and difficult: 60 - 24 = 36 questions
36 questions are divided into 2 categories: average and difficult, so each category has 36 / 2 = 18 questions

Now, let's find out how many questions Aries is sure to get in each category:
Easy questions: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18
Average questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9
Difficult questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9

Now, let's add up the number of questions Aries is sure to get: 18 + 9 + 9 = 36

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 'x' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'y'.
2. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation: x = 2y.
3. We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one, so the price of a large stuffed animal is $12.
4. The total earnings from the sales are $120, which is the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals. We can write an equation: 4x + 12y = 120.
5. Since x = 2y (from step 2), we can substitute this into the equation from step 4: 4(2y) + 12y = 120.
6. Simplifying the equation, we get: 8y + 12y = 120, which is 20y = 120.
7. To find the value of y, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: y = 120 / 20 = 6.
8. Since x = 2y (from step 2), we can find the value of x by multiplying y by 2: x = 2 * 6 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches they eat per day and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 

Total sandwiches per day = 5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

Now, multiply the total sandwiches per day by 7 (days in a week):
11 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches/week

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 2 * 12 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Next, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. Since he can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. Since one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days with steel pickaxes. Since they can mine 1440 pounds of ore per day, they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore in 30 days.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The ratio for the first package is 3/2, and for the second package is 6/4. We can simplify these ratios to 3/2 and 3/2, indicating that the price increases by a factor of 1.5 for each additional sandwich. 

Since the first package has 2 sandwiches and the second package has 4 sandwiches, the price of the second package is 1.5 times the price of the first package. 

Given that the second package costs $6, we can calculate the price of the first package as 6 / 1.5 = $4. 

Now, we can calculate the price of the package with 8 sandwiches by multiplying the price of the first package by 4 (since 8 is 4 times 2), which is 4 * 4 = $16.

The final answer is: $16"
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to subtract the amount he paid from the total cost of the bedroom set. 

First, let's find out how much Tom still owes after selling his old bedroom set. 
Total cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount he paid from selling his old bedroom: $1000
Amount still owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Now, we need to find out how much he has to pay per month. 
Monthly payment: 10% of $2000
10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200

"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 x 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so she released 6 yellow balloons, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 x 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's add up the remaining balloons: 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons. 

15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

The final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 34."
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). 

However, the third scenario is dependent on the second scenario not happening, so we need to multiply the probabilities of the second and third scenarios together. 

The probability that the normal teacher doesn't give an extension is 100% - 40% = 60%. 

The probability that Marcus convinces the teacher his dog ate his assignment is 20% of 60%, which is 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12 or 12%.

The total probability that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework is 50% + 40% + 12% = 0.5 + 0.4 + 0.12 = 0.92 or 92%.

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 100% - 92% = 8%.

Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = $45 - $9
Net earnings = $36

Next, we need to find out how many hours she worked in total: 
Total hours = 6 hours per day * 3 days
Total hours = 18 hours

Now, let's calculate her hourly pay after expenses:
Hourly pay after expenses = Net earnings / Total hours
Hourly pay after expenses = $36 / 18

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to find out how many bottles of soda he will place along the driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next.

First, we need to find out how many bottles of soda Richard will place along the driveway. Since the driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet, we can divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet = 8 bottles

Since it takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we can multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next:

8 bottles * 5 seconds = 40 seconds

"To find out how many packs Uncle Franky can make, we need to first find out how many apples he has in total. Since he ordered two boxes and each box has 40 apples, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box.

Total apples = 2 boxes * 40 apples/box = 80 apples

Next, we need to find out how many packs he can make with 80 apples. Since each pack has 8 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack.

Number of packs = Total apples / apples per pack = 80 / 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract that from the initial amount of money she had.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 x $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 x $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor starts with $50, so subtracting the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount of money, we get:
$50 - $40 = $10.

Therefore, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and not working while in college. 

The total amount of loans he took is 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000.

The amount of money he lost by not working for 4 years is 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000.

So, the total amount of money he needs to earn is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After college, his income triples, so he now earns $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

To find out how long it will take him to earn $300,000 at this new income, we divide the total amount by his new income: $300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, so the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of one piece of fabric is length * width, so it's 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, he needs 2 * 80 = 160 square feet of fabric.

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102. 
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 
5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209. 
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add up the number of letters delivered each day: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The final answer is: 736"

"Let's denote the share of the first person as x. 

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

The share of the first person is $420."
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

First, let's convert 3 weeks to days: 3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to find the fraction of a day in hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 of a day is (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2010.

The car was bought in 2007, so we need to calculate the depreciation for 3 years (2008, 2009, and 2010).

The depreciation rate is 21% per year. To calculate the depreciation, we can use the formula:

Price after depreciation = Price * (1 - depreciation rate)

For the first year (2008):
Price after depreciation = 20000 * (1 - 0.21) = 20000 * 0.79 = 15800

For the second year (2009):
Price after depreciation = 15800 * (1 - 0.21) = 15800 * 0.79 = 12532

For the third year (2010):
Price after depreciation = 12532 * (1 - 0.21) = 12532 * 0.79 = 9925.48

So, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9925.48."

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"To find the total amount Alison spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

1. The tank top cost $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since a twin bed has 1 set of sheets and a king size bed has 1 set of sheets, the total number of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 + 1 = 5.

Since he can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we need to convert the number of twin sets to king sets. 4 twin sets is equivalent to 2 king sets (since 2 twin sets = 1 king set). So, the total number of king sets he needs to wash is 2 (from the twin sets) + 1 (from the king bed) = 3.

Now, we can calculate the number of loads of laundry he does in a week. Since he needs to wash 3 king sets of sheets, and he can wash 1 king set at a time, he needs 3 loads of laundry for the king sets. He also needs to wash 2 twin sets, but since he can wash 2 twin sets at a time, he only needs 1 load of laundry for the twin sets. So, the total number of loads of laundry he does in a week is 3 (for the king sets) + 1 (for the twin sets) = 4.

To find out how many loads of laundry he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads he does in a week by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads of laundry he does in a year is 4 * 52 = 208.

The final answer is: 208"
"To find the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and multiply it by 4.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies. 
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

In 4 weeks, they will watch 6 * 4 = 24 movies.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to add the stickers he had two years ago, the stickers he collected last year, and the stickers he collected this year.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.
This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.
So, this year, Leo has 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

Now, we add the stickers from two years ago, last year, and this year: 100 + 150 + 250 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount of cat food Imma feeds her cats per day (60 grams * 2 = 120 grams).

First, we calculate the total daily consumption: 60 grams * 2 = 120 grams per day.

Then, we divide the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption: 720 grams / 120 grams per day = 6 days.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate. 

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, we know that Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. 

To find the total number of slices they ate, we add these numbers together: 10 + 7 + 14 = 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"Let's denote Donovan's part as D and Betsy's part as B. We know that B = D + 18 and the total time is 98 minutes, so D + B = 98. 

Substituting B = D + 18 into the second equation, we get D + (D + 18) = 98. Simplifying this, we get 2D + 18 = 98. Subtracting 18 from both sides, we get 2D = 80. Dividing both sides by 2, we get D = 40.

Now that we know Donovan's part took 40 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to D. B = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the costs of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The cost of the visit is $300/hour for 0.5 hours (30 minutes). So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of parking is $6/hour for 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The final answer is: $482"
"To find out how many emails James responds to, we first need to find out how many emails he doesn't respond to. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 x 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the rest, which is 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Now, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. 

Since James responds to 64 emails per day, in a 5-day work week, he responds to 64 x 5 = 320 emails.

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the total number of classes that visited:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 207

"To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests. 

John's scores are: 100, 100, 100, and 80. 

First, let's add up the scores: 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380.

Next, we divide the total score by the number of tests: 380 / 4 = 95.

The average score is 95."
"To find the number of pizzas left, we first need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 is 0.7 x 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. 
They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 x 40 = 32 pizzas.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

He also wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, which is 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

The final answer is: 245"
"To find out how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered, we need to subtract 3 from 10. 

10 - 3 = 7

Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 

7 * 4 = 28

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, there were 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches left. Sidney then ordered 3 more sub sandwiches. 

3 + 3 = 6

Now, there are 6 meatball sub sandwiches left. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 

6 * 4 = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the number of trucks that had mechanical failures, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total number of tons of fertiliser that did not reach the farmers is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The number of trucks that did reach the farmers is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

The total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total cost of the butter, we need to calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter with the promotion. 

Since Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter. 

The promotion is buy one pound of butter get one half off, which means that for every 2 pounds of butter, he will pay the full price of 1 pound. 

So, for 6 pounds of butter, he will pay for 3 pounds at the full price and 3 pounds at half the price. 

The cost of 3 pounds at the full price is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00. 

The cost of 3 pounds at half the price is 3 * $2.00 = $6.00. 

The total cost of 6 pounds of butter is $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00.

The final answer is: $18.00"
"To find the total number of guests, we need to add the number of classmates, dance class members, and family members, then subtract the number of people who said they could not come. 

Total guests = 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family members) - 4 (could not come) = 41

Since the initial fee is for 20 guests, we need to find the number of additional guests. 

Additional guests = Total guests - 20 = 41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is $6 per guest. 

Cost for additional guests = 21 * 6 = 126

The total cost is the initial fee plus the cost for the additional guests.

Total cost = $125 (initial fee) + $126 (cost for additional guests) = $251

The final answer is: $251"
"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to first calculate how much they spent.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of $60. 
1/4 * $60 = $15

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60.
1/3 * $60 = $20

Now, let's calculate how much money they each have left:
Maggie had $60 and spent $15, so she has $60 - $15 = $45 left.
Riza had $60 and spent $20, so she has $60 - $20 = $40 left.

The total amount of money they have left is $45 + $40 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat each day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. 

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys in total, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day.

We know that the total number of bananas is 315, and they last for a week, which is 7 days. So, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315 * 7 = 2205.

However, since we are looking for the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to find the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day, so in a week, the first monkey eats 10 * 7 = 70 bananas. The second monkey eats 14 bananas each day, so in a week, the second monkey eats 14 * 7 = 98 bananas.

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is 70 + 98 = 168 bananas.

Now, we know that the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 2205, and the first two monkeys eat 168 bananas in a week. So, the third monkey eats 2205 - 168 = 2037 bananas in a week.

However, this is the total number of bananas the third monkey eats in a week, not each day. To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to divide the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7.

The third monkey eats 2037 / 7 = 291 bananas each day.

"To find out how much Jenny paid for the roses, we need to determine if she bought the roses by the dozen or individually. Since she bought 15 roses, it's more cost-effective for her to buy a dozen (12 roses) and 3 individual roses.

The cost of a dozen roses is $15. 
The cost of 3 individual roses is 3 * $2 = $6.
The total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she paid with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

Jenny leaves with 16 quarters."

"To find out how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time Paul will wait for the fourth train to arrive.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, we need to find out how long Paul will wait for the fourth train to arrive. Since the current time is 0 minutes, Paul will wait from 0 to 145 minutes. Therefore, Paul will wait for 145 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks Melanie needs to save toothpicks, we first need to determine how many toothpicks she has saved so far. 

Melanie saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. 
10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total, we subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total number of toothpicks she needs. 
200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week. 
80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and then the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is:

$2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so the price his friend paid is:

$1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price his friend paid, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100:

Percentage discount = ((Original price - Price paid) / Original price) * 100
= (($2000 - $1800) / $2000) * 100
= ($200 / $2000) * 100
= 0.10 * 100
= 10%

"To find the total number of jellyfish created, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of jellyfish each spring creates per second. 

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in the given time frame. 

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, the total number of jellyfish created by one spring in 14400 seconds is 14400.

Now, if we have 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created is 5 times the number created by one spring.

5 * 14400 = 72000

"To find the total distance James walked, we need to calculate the round trip. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back home, the total distance is 2 * 4 miles = 8 miles.

Since James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can find the time it took him to walk the total distance by dividing the total distance by his speed: 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and compare it to the cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be: 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost would be: 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet of fence.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. To find out how much is left over, we need to subtract the amount Sam gets from the total amount of fence:

100 - 20 = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to determine the rate of growth per year. 

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find the rate of growth per year, we divide the total growth by the number of years: 
8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year.

Now, we multiply the rate of growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years:
2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.

"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

Let's break down the information:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the total earnings:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we first need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class per day. 

There are 6 periods in a day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes per day is 6 * 40 = 240 minutes.

Since John goes to class for 5 days a week, the total minutes he spends in class per week is 240 * 5 = 1200 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. 1/16 of his weekly minutes is spent on these days. His weekly minutes are 1200, so 1/16 of 1200 is (1/16) * 1200 = 75 minutes.

The total minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday is 75 * 2 = 150 minutes.

Now, we add the minutes he spends in class and the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. 1200 + 150 = 1350 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 1350 / 60 = 22.5 hours.

"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to convert the height of the first child to inches and then calculate the height of each child step by step.

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the height of the first child in inches is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child. So, the height of the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child. So, the height of the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child. So, the height of the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10).

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

"To find the original weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the 270 kilograms left after the Allosaurus ate.

First, the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which was half of what the velociraptors had. So, the velociraptors had 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms.

Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex, the T-Rex must have eaten half of the original weight of the triceratops. The velociraptors had 540 kilograms, which is half of what the T-Rex ate. So, the T-Rex ate 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the original weight of the triceratops was 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint to find out how many gallons are needed. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet. 
The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet. 
The total area of the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, Ellen had 12 sodas. She shook 3 of them, so 3 were shaken and 9 were unshaken. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 1 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there is 1 shaken can out of a total of 7 cans (1 shaken + 6 unshaken). 

The probability of Ellen's friend getting a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans: 1/7.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/7) * 100 = 14.29%."
"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. So, the total distance is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find the total number of days Billy helps, we first need to find the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

However, Billy takes 20% of these days off. 20% of 50 is 0.2 * 50 = 10. So, he takes 10 days off.

The number of days he helps is 50 - 10 = 40.

Since Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

The total number of people he helps is 40 * 6 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people who were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people who attended the wedding.

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses:
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the number of people transported from the total number of people who attended the wedding. However, the question does not provide the total number of people who attended the wedding. 

But, we can assume that the total number of people who attended the wedding is the sum of the people transported by the buses and the cars, and the people inside the church. 

So, let's assume the total number of people who attended the wedding is x. Then, the number of people inside the church is x - 480.

However, we can also assume that the number of people inside the church is the difference between the total number of people who attended the wedding and the people who were transported by the buses and the cars. 

Since the question does not provide the total number of people who attended the wedding, we cannot calculate the exact number of people inside the church."
"To find Jeff's age, we need to first find Martha's age. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, we can calculate Jeff's age by adding 10 to Martha's age.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the two slides:
Difference in time = Time for the biggest slide - Time for the second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total time spent on lunches and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 
Total time spent on breaks per day = 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes
Total time spent on lunch and breaks per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Now, we multiply the total time spent per day by 5:
1 hour * 5 = 5 hours

The total time spent on lunches and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours."
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total miles run by all three is 52. We can subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after returning the $15.00 item and then add that to the initial charge.

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. Return: -$15.00 (since she returned an item)
   New balance: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

3. Frying pan: 20% off $20.00
   Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
   Price of frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

4. Towels: 10% off $30.00
   Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
   Price of towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

5. Total cost of new purchases: $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

6. New balance: $70.00 (previous balance) + $43.00 (new purchases) = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Let's break down the information given:

- A fifth of the jellyfish are large.
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
- The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue.
- When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. 
A third of the large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, so x/15 = 6. 

To find the total number of jellyfish, we need to solve for x:
x/15 = 6
x = 6 * 15
x = 90

The final answer is: 90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to first find Ben's age, and then multiply it by 3.

Since Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age as follows:
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3:
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for her retirement. 

First, let's calculate her annual expenses during retirement. 40% of her current annual salary is 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000.

Since she plans to live for 20 years, her total expenses during retirement will be 20 * $40,000 = $800,000.

Lauren saves 20% of her current salary, which is 0.2 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

To find out how many years she needs to work to save $800,000, we can divide the total amount needed by the amount she saves per year: $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for her retirement expenses. Since she plans to live for 20 years after retirement, we need to subtract 20 from the total number of years to find out how many more years she needs to work: 40 - 20 = 20 years.

"To find the total population of the school, we need to divide the number of boys by the percentage of boys. 

First, we convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 40% = 40/100 = 0.4

Then, we divide the number of boys by this decimal: 240 / 0.4 = 600

This means the total population of the school is 600. 

Since 40% of the school population is boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. 

To find the number of girls, we multiply the total population by the percentage of girls: 600 * 0.6 = 360

"To find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

To find out how many days it will take her to hike 9,300 miles, we divide the total miles by the miles per day: 9,300 / 250 = 37.2 days.

Since Soledad only has 30 days in June, she will not be able to complete her journey on time. To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we need to calculate the total miles she can hike in 30 days at 250 miles per day: 250 * 30 = 7,500 miles.

The difference between the total miles she wants to hike and the total miles she can hike in 30 days is 9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 miles.

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the difference by the number of days: 1,800 / 30 = 60 miles per day.

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine how much Anna spent on the books. 

Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left. However, she only has $2 left, which means she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since Anna bought 2 books and they cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount spent on books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$10 / 2 = $5

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find out how many times it blinks per minute, we divide 255 by 5.

255 / 5 = 51

So, the light blinks 51 times per minute. 

Now, to find out how long it will take the light to blink 459 times, we divide 459 by 51.

459 / 51 = 9

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles (one way)

Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Total Distance = 140 miles * 2
Total Distance = 280 miles

John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the total distance by 2:
Total Distance per Month = 280 miles * 2
Total Distance per Month = 560 miles

"To find the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers, we first need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour and the 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour produce a total of 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour produce a total of 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour.

So, the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers per hour is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since they work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers is 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, and the total number of toys ordered is 400. This means that the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Since the 4 workers produce 200 toys, the fifth worker must produce the remaining 380 - 200 = 180 toys.

To find the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked: 180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour.

"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we first need to find the weight of each of his dogs. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so Elijah's first dog weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. 

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so Elijah's second dog weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

The total weight of Elijah's dogs is 15 + 30 = 45 pounds. 

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add Elijah's dogs to Kory's dog: 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

"To find Vince's current age, we first need to find Liam's age two years ago. Since Liam is 16 now, two years ago he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince, so we can set up the equation: 14 = 2 * Vince's age two years ago.

To find Vince's age two years ago, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: Vince's age two years ago = 14 / 2 = 7.

Since we want to find Vince's current age, we need to add 2 to his age two years ago: Vince's current age = 7 + 2 = 9.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's call this number x.
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted y. Then, Camden painted y + 12 eggs.
3. Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we can write the equation: y + (y + 12) = 30
4. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2y + 12 = 30
5. Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get: 2y = 18
6. Dividing both sides by 2, we get: y = 9
7. Since y is the number of eggs Sarah painted, Camden painted y + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.
8. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, x = 21.
9. The question asks how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Since Camden painted 21 eggs and Arnold painted 21 eggs, Camden painted 0 more eggs than Arnold.

"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total number of boxes and the total weight of the crayons and boxes.

Nik has 200 crayons and wants to put them into boxes of 8 crayons each. To find the total number of boxes, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box:

200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces and there are 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is:

25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and Nik has 200 crayons, so the total weight of the crayons is:

200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces

The total weight of the crayons and boxes is the sum of their individual weights:

200 ounces (boxes) + 200 ounces (crayons) = 400 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16:

400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds

"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to calculate 80% of 80 feet. 

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet long, we need to divide the total length of the usable tree by the length of each log.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks, so we multiply the number of logs by 5.

16 * 5 = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 * 1.2 = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find the salary of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, and her brother earns 2 times her salary, so her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so their mother earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out Grandma's speed on the beach and on the sidewalk. 

Let's assume Grandma's speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she spends 40 minutes on the beach. 

The time it takes to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/x. The time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/(2x).

Since the total time spent on the beach is 40 minutes, we can set up the equation: 2/x = 40.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by x, which gives us 2 = 40x. Then, we can divide both sides by 40, which gives us x = 1/20.

Now that we know Grandma's speed on the beach is 1/20 miles per minute, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2(1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

The time it takes to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/(1/20) = 40 minutes. The time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/(1/10) = 10 minutes.

The total time it takes to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach a total of $60:
$60 (target) - $32 (already saved) = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

1. If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 marbles. So, Bob currently has 60 - 24 = 36 marbles.

2. If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, we need to subtract 10 from the current number of marbles he has. 

36 - 10 = 26

So, Bob will have 26 marbles."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle. 

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the temperatures of the two mugs. 

The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle). 

The average temperature of the water in the bottle is (33 + x) / 2.

Since Donny can drink the water, the average temperature must be at least 40 degrees. 

We can set up the inequality:

(33 + x) / 2 ≥ 40

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:

33 + x ≥ 80

Subtract 33 from both sides:

x ≥ 47

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens. 

In three weeks, there are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks have 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, so in 21 days, they will bring 20 * 21 = 420 cows.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day, so in 21 days, they will bring 10 * 21 = 210 chickens.

The total number of cows is 50 (initial cows) + 420 (cows from Milkie Cows Limited) = 470 cows.

The total number of chickens is 20 (initial chickens) + 210 (chickens from Broilers Limited) = 230 chickens.

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700.

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the total cost of the bagels, we first need to calculate the original price of 4 packs of bagels. 

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs will cost 4 x $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00 to find the discount amount. 

10% of $40.00 = 0.1 x $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the final cost of the 4 packs of bagels.

$40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, we can find the total number of bagels by multiplying the number of packs by the number of bagels per pack.

4 packs x 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost of the bagels by the total number of bagels.

$36.00 ÷ 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to first determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes he ate. 

Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
So, the number of scoops Gomer ate is 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. 
It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. 
So, the number of potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop is 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
The number of potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop is 3, so the number of potatoes it takes to make 18 scoops is 18 * 3 = 54 potatoes.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.

240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to find the total number of red jellybeans. We know that there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans. 

So, the number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34.

We know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We already know the number of green and red jellybeans, so we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the number of green and red jellybeans from the total.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
= 60 - (17 + 34)
= 60 - 51
= 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the total number of lemons he gets in a year and then multiply it by 10 (since a decade has 10 years).

In a year, Tim grows 5 trees and collects 6 lemons from each tree. So, the total number of lemons he gets in a year is:
5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

Now, we multiply the number of lemons he gets in a year by 10 to find the total number of lemons in a decade:
30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

"To find the number of women on the bus initially, we need to first find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 9 = 14. 

The fraction of the total number of passengers that are women is 9/14. 

To find the number of women on the bus initially, we multiply the fraction by the total number of passengers: (9/14) * 84 = 54.

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is 54 - 20 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first determine how many bouquets and individual sunflowers he sold per day. 

Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers and $56 from the bouquets per day. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total amount earned from bouquets is 12 times the cost of a bouquet, which is 12 * $8 = $96. However, he only earned $56 from the bouquets, so the difference is $96 - $56 = $40. This $40 must be the amount earned from the individual sunflowers. 

Since each sunflower costs $2, the number of sunflowers sold per day is $40 / $2 = 20 sunflowers.

Now, we need to find out the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days. The total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days is 20 * 3 = 60 sunflowers.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference between the two.

Adam has $100 to invest, and each rock costs $5. To find out how many rocks he can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Since Adam sells 60% of his inventory, we need to find 60% of 20 rocks:

60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each:

12 rocks * $7 = $84

The total cost of buying 20 rocks is:

20 rocks * $5 = $100

Since Adam only sells 12 rocks, he still has 8 rocks left, which he didn't sell. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

8 rocks * $5 = $40

The total cost of the rocks Adam bought is $100, but he only sold $84 worth of rocks. He also has $40 worth of unsold rocks. So, the total cost of the rocks is $100 + $40 = $140.

The total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks is $84. To find out how much money Adam loses, we subtract the total revenue from the total cost:

$140 - $84 = $56

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of large, medium, and small-sized picture scenes Lauren needs to draw. 

First, let's find the LCM of 45, 36, and 49. 

The prime factorization of 45 is 3^2 * 5.
The prime factorization of 36 is 2^2 * 3^2.
The prime factorization of 49 is 7^2.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
LCM(45, 36, 49) = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5 * 7^2 = 4 * 9 * 5 * 49 = 8820.

Now, let's find out how many days it will take Lauren to draw each type of picture scene:
- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

The greatest common multiple of the days is 63 days, but we can also find the LCM of the number of days for each type of picture scene:
- LCM(9, 6, 7) = 2 * 3^2 * 7 = 126.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (which is the decimal form of 60%).

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we have the lengths of both songs: 5 minutes for the first song and 8 minutes for the second song. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the profit from each day and then add them together.

On Monday, Linus bought 2 devices for $20 each. So, the total cost for Monday is 2 * $20 = $40. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the total revenue from Monday is 2 * $40 = $80. The profit from Monday is $80 - $40 = $40.

On Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each. So, the total cost for Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the total revenue from Tuesday is 4 * $40 = $160. The profit from Tuesday is $160 - $80 = $80.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Since each juice can cover 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of 1 person's daily energy demand, Hortex would need 100 / 20 = 5 bottles.

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the number of bottles it can produce from the total number of bottles required:

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Since Carla has 8 babies and 3/4 of them wear purple, the number of babies wearing purple is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

Since 1/4 of the babies wear blue, the number of babies wearing blue is 1/4 * 8 = 2.

The number of babies wearing blue and bows is 2. The number of babies wearing purple and bows is 1/3 of the purple wearers, which is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

The total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4.

The percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is (number of purple babies wearing bows / total number of babies wearing bows) * 100 = (2 / 4) * 100 = 50%.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, and then subtract that result from the total number of reports received during the week.

Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

First, let's find the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 1907 + 2136 = 4043

Now, let's subtract this result from the total number of reports received during the week to find the number of reports received on Wednesday:
Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received during the week - Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

The final answer is: 1125"
"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount of land he sold in each transaction and then multiply it by the price he received for that land.

Initially, Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. 
Half of 80 is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. 
So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 
1/4 of 80 is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. 
So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.

The remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

He then sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter. 
So, he earned 20 * 3 = $60 from the remaining land.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned:
- From the first sale: $50
- From the second sale: $30
- From the third sale: $60
Total amount earned = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140

The final answer is: $140"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. 

Haley's age is 26 years. Half of 26 is 26 / 2 = 13.

Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, so we need to subtract 10 from 13. 

13 - 10 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to first find out how many face masks he uses in a day. 

Since Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, the total number of face masks he uses in a day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2. 

6 * 2 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found by each person and subtract that from the initial number of eggs.

Initially, there were 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 x 5 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs found is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total found from the initial number: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to find the size of the third apartment complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so their combined size is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400.

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. Adding this to 400 gives 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

So, the total number of apartments is 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects from 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

- Year 1: 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
- Year 2: 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- Year 3: 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- Year 4: The tree is now 8 years old, but the problem doesn't give us the amount of fruits it produces directly. However, it tells us that an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
- Year 5: The tree is now 9 years old, but the problem states that it doesn't produce any fruits in the ninth year.
- Year 6: The tree is now 10 years old and produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up the fruits produced each year:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 1350

The final answer is: 1350"
"To find out how much money Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of Sophia's $100 and add it to Jack's initial $100.

1/5 of $100 is $20 (since 1/5 * 100 = 20).

Now, we add $20 to Jack's initial $100: $100 + $20 = $120.

So, Jack now has $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R. 

We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so B = Y - 7.

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so R = 4B.

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so Y + B + R = 37.

Substituting the expressions for B and R in terms of Y into the equation, we get Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37.

Simplifying the equation, we get Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides to get 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6 to get Y = 12.

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope: B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5.

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope: R = 4B = 4(5) = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so if Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

2. After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount given to the little sister 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

3. According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money, which means $15 - x = (4/5) * $15.

4. We can simplify the equation: $15 - x = $12.

5. Solving for x, we get x = $3.

6. Now, we know that Ronnie is left with $5 - x, which is $5 - $3 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the information given:

- There are four colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow.
- There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
- Half the mural is yellow.
- The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is the combination of red, white, and purple paint. Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as x. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the total amount of these three colors is 3x.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow. So, the other half is 6 pints (12 / 2 = 6). This 6 pints is the combination of red, white, and purple paint, which is 3x.

We can set up the equation: 3x = 6

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 6 / 3
x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are equal amounts of each, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, and then add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas together: 960 (bedrooms) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 3160 square feet.

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

The final answer is: 3160"
"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and add them up.

On Monday, Alice counts 3 clouds.
On Tuesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 3 * 2 = 6 clouds.
On Wednesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she counts double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the total number of clouds:

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box for $1, we first need to find out how many pods are in the new box. 

The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. 20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. So the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with the new box for $12. Since the new box costs $12 and you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 120 cycles with the new box for $12.

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the total number of cycles by 12. 

120 cycles / 12 = 10 cycles per dollar.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since he withdraws 1000 dollars in 20 dollar bills, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home. So, he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills to pay for the bill. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he has 20 bills left, and each bill is worth $20, he has 20 * 20 = $400. Tripling this amount gives him 3 * 400 = $1200.

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has $1200, he needs to convert 1200 / 5 = 240 5 dollar bills.

The final answer is: 240"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.

Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored in the match. In the first half, team A scored 4 goals and team B scored 2 goals. In the second half, team A scored 2 goals and team B scored 8 goals.

Total goals scored by team A = 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Total goals scored by team B = 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

Total goals scored in the match = 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then divide it by the daily usage.

Initially, the teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk, so the amount of chalk left is:

5 - (45% of 5) = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches

Now, the teacher goes back to using 20% of the chalk each day. To find out how many days the chalk will last, we need to divide the remaining chalk by the daily usage:

2.75 / (20% of 5) = 2.75 / 1 = 2.75

Since the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we need to round down to the nearest whole number, as he will recycle the chalk on the next day.

"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to find the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4.
One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for C:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
20 = C

"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza that her friends will eat. 

For cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is 6 * 6 = 36. 

For pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 4 * 6 = 24.

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find out how many whole pizzas are needed for each type. 

For cheese pizza, 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas. 

For pepperoni pizza, 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. 

The total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy is 3 + 3 = 6."

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many snowballs Jay builds per minute and how many melt per minute, and then calculate the net change in the number of snowballs per minute.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 60 minutes, so he builds 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so they melt 2/15 snowballs per minute.

The net change in the number of snowballs per minute is (1/3) - (2/15) = (5/15) - (2/15) = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay wants 60 snowballs, and he has a net gain of 1/5 snowballs per minute, we can set up the equation:

Initial snowballs + (net change per minute) * time = 60

Since we don't know the initial number of snowballs, we can assume it's 0, as Jay is starting from scratch.

0 + (1/5) * time = 60

To solve for time, we multiply both sides by 5:

time = 60 * 5
time = 300 minutes

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the remaining bandages after the first day are x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The remaining bandages after the second day are (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they had 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The remaining bandages after the third day are (x - 16) - 25 + 100 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 59 = 78

To solve for x, we subtract 59 from both sides:

x = 19

"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees separately and then add them together.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's add the total number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted over the two days:
White Oak: 20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 30
Lodgepole Pine: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

Total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days = 30 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how much root beer was available for each person to drink, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer left after all the incidents. 

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer. 

On the first day, 4 gallons were stolen by his children. So, 24 - 4 = 20 gallons were left.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled. So, 20 - 7 = 13 gallons were left.

On the third day, 5 gallons were taken by Ronnie. So, 13 - 5 = 8 gallons were left.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the remaining root beer equally. So, we need to divide the remaining 8 gallons by 4 (Fred and the 3 other people).

8 / 4 = 2 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Let x be the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The problem states that ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8.

We are told that this expression is equal to 40, so we can set up the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we need to calculate one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

Now, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes. First, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. 

The number of fish without red stripes is 66 - 22 = 44.

5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. 

5/11 of 44 is (5/11) * 44 = 20.

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes. 

The total number of fish with red and blue stripes is 22 + 20 = 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"Amy initially had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes. 

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 eyeshadow colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which had 4 colors, so Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors.

Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 eyeshadow colors.

Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors and used up 3 eyeshadow colors, so she lost a total of 4 + 3 = 7 eyeshadow colors.

Amy initially had 26 eyeshadow colors and lost 7 eyeshadow colors, so she has 26 - 7 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the information given.

1. Mattison's height is 60 inches.
2. The two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.
3. The first floor's floor to ceiling height is thrice as high as Mattison, so the first floor's height is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.
4. Since the total height of the house is 420 inches and the first floor's height is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.
5. The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the same as the height of the first floor, which is 180 inches.

"To find the number of shells found by team Alphas, we need to calculate 40% of 700. 

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found their share. 

Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
= 700 - 280
= 420 shells.

Next, we need to find the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters. 

Shells found by Gogetters = Total shells - (Shells found by Alphas + Shells found by The finders)
= 700 - (280 + 252)
= 700 - 532
= 168 shells.

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we need to calculate the total miles walked by the first three dogs and then subtract that from the total average miles walked by all four dogs.

The first dog needs to walk 1 mile, the second needs 4 miles, and the third needs 3 miles. So, the total miles walked by the first three dogs is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

The average miles walked by all four dogs is 3 miles. Since there are 4 dogs, the total miles walked by all four dogs is 3 * 4 = 12 miles.

Now, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs to find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk: 12 - 8 = 4 miles.

The last dog needs to walk 4 miles."
"To find out how much John borrowed, we need to calculate 40% of the value of his house. 

40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

He used 60% of this amount to pay off his debts. 

60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

This means he paid off $60,000 of his debt. To find out how much he had leftover, we need to subtract this amount from the amount he borrowed.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

So, John had $40,000 leftover after paying off his debt.

"To find the total weight of the tunas, we need to add the weights of all three tunas. 

Weight of the first tuna = 56 kilograms
Weight of the second tuna = 46 kilograms
Weight of the last tuna = 26 kilograms

Total weight of the tunas = 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we need to multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Total weight of the tunas * Cost per kilogram
Total earnings = 128 * 0.50
Total earnings = 64

"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The cost price of the magazines is $72. 
Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them. 

To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 11/8: 
Selling price = Cost price * (11/8) 
Selling price = $72 * (11/8) 
Selling price = $72 * 1.375 
Selling price = $99 

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price: 
Profit = Selling price - Cost price 
Profit = $99 - $72 
Profit = $27

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed on each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total water removed on the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total water removed on the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Brian ran it for 5 days, so the total water removed on the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total water removed on each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

Ali's class capacity is 120 students. 
1/8 of 120 is 120 / 8 = 15 students per class.

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is 15 * 2 = 30 students.

The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of Ali's class capacity and John's classes capacity. 
Combined capacity = 120 (Ali's class) + 30 (John's classes) = 150 students.

"To find the total amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the total interest he owes his sister. 

The interest is 2% of $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he will pay in the first 11 months is 11 * 25 = $275.

The remaining amount, including the interest, that Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is the initial amount borrowed plus the interest minus the amount he paid in the first 11 months. 

So, the amount he will pay in the twelfth month is 300 + 6 - 275 = 31.

"To find the total volume of the jar, we need to multiply the length, width, and height of the jar. 

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume used by the jelly beans will be 80% of the total volume. 

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of one jelly bean.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between his guess and the true number of red jelly beans.

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Number of red jelly beans estimated by Tim (which we don't know)
However, we can find the percentage difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans estimated by Tim.  To do this we need to know the number of red jelly beans estimated by Tim.  Since we don't know this, we can't find the difference."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the bus had 20 people.

3. At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop (40) entered the bus. This means 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.
4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, the bus has 200 - 180 = 20 spaces left.

"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that will be formed and then multiply that by the time it takes for each group to try the escape room.

There are 4 grades (4-7) with 10 students in each grade, so the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only the top 10 students in each grade get to try the escape room, the total number of students trying the escape room is 4 * 10 = 40.

However, only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students trying the escape room by the number of students per group: 40 / 8 = 5.

Since each group uses their full 45 minutes, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is the number of groups multiplied by the time per group: 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the length of the shorter piece is x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet, we can find the length of the longer piece by multiplying 8 by 4:

4x = 4(8) = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of meat

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can multiply the total pounds of meat by the amount of seasoning per pound to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

5 pounds of meat * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning

"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the standard lessons and the veteran lessons separately, and then add them together.

For the standard lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour, so the total amount he earns from these lessons is:
4 * $80 = $320

For the veteran lessons, Charlie reduces his rate by 25%, so his new rate is:
$80 - (25% of $80) = $80 - $20 = $60

He has 2 lessons at this rate, so the total amount he earns from the veteran lessons is:
2 * $60 = $120

Now, we add the amounts earned from the standard lessons and the veteran lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make:
$320 + $120 = $440

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The sum of the scores is 630.

There are 9 scores in total.

Now, let's divide the sum by the total number of scores:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

The mean score is 70."
"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first determine how many pomelos she had left. Since she was left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can calculate this as follows:

Original amount: 20 pomelos
1/4 of the original amount: 20 * 1/4 = 5 pomelos

Since Eve was left with 5 pomelos, we can find out how many she gave away by subtracting the amount she had left from the original amount:

Pomelos given away: 20 - 5 = 15

"To find the number of apples Walter ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60. 

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. 

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

60 - 24 = 36

Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. 

25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. 

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. 

The amount of money he received = 27 * 3 = 81

The final answer is: 81"
"To find the total number of novels Regina wrote this year, we need to determine the total number of novels she wrote last year and then multiply it by 4 (since 3 quarters is equivalent to 3/4, and 4 is the reciprocal of 3/4).

Let's start by setting up the equation:

9 novels = 3/4 * x

To find x, we can multiply both sides by 4/3:

9 * (4/3) = x
12 = x

So, Regina wrote 12 novels last year. 

Since 9 novels is 3/4 of the total number of novels she wrote this year, we can set up the equation:

9 = 3/4 * x

To find x, we can multiply both sides by 4/3:

9 * (4/3) = x
12 = x

However, this is the number of novels she wrote last year. We need to find the total number of novels she wrote this year. Since 9 novels is 3/4 of the total number of novels she wrote this year, we can set up the equation:

9 = 3/4 * x

To find x, we can multiply both sides by 4/3:

9 * (4/3) = x
12 = 3/4 * x

To find the total number of novels she wrote this year, we can multiply 12 by 4/3:

12 * (4/3) = x
16 = x

"To find the distance covered by Michael in 3 days, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in 3 days at an average speed of 50 km/hr.

First, we need to convert the time from days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3 days is equal to 3 x 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total distance traveled by multiplying the average speed by the total time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 50 km/hr x 72 hr
Distance = 3600 km

Now, we can find the percentage of the distance covered by dividing the distance traveled by the total distance between Alaska and Texas and multiplying by 100:

Percentage = (Distance traveled / Total distance) x 100
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) x 100
Percentage = 0.6 x 100
Percentage = 60%

"To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to determine how many grapes were used by Madeline's brother and her mother, and then add the initial number of grapes Madeline ate.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, she used 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline's brother and her mother is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

Since Madeline ate 6 grapes initially, the total number of grapes at the beginning is 84 + 6 = 90 grapes.

The final answer is: 90"

"To find the total number of classrooms the custodian needs to clean, we already know that number is 80. 

The custodian has 5 days to clean the classrooms. 

First, we need to find the total number of minutes the custodian has to clean the classrooms. Since they work 8 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, they have 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per day. 

Since they have 5 days, they have a total of 480 * 5 = 2400 minutes to clean the classrooms.

Now, we need to find the total number of minutes it takes to clean all the classrooms. Since it takes them 15 minutes per classroom, and there are 80 classrooms, it will take them 80 * 15 = 1200 minutes.

Now, we can find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms. To do this, we need to divide the total number of minutes spent cleaning classrooms by the total number of minutes they have to clean, and then multiply by 100.

(1200 / 2400) * 100 = 50%

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of books the middle shelves can hold as 'x'. Since there are two middle shelves, the total number of books they can hold is 2x.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2x books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 2x - 5 books.

The total number of books the bookcase can hold is the sum of the books on all shelves: 2x + 2x + 2x - 5 = 6x - 5.

We know that Elly has 110 books, so we can set up the equation: 6x - 5 = 110.

To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation: 6x = 115.

Then, we divide both sides by 6: x = 115 / 6.

x = 19.17 (round down to 19 since you can't have a fraction of a bookshelf)

Now that we know x, we can find the total number of books the bookcase can hold: 6x - 5 = 6 * 19 - 5 = 113.

Since 113 is less than 110, we need at least two bookcases to hold all the books.

However, we also need to consider the remaining 110 - 113 = -3 books. Since we can't have a negative number of books, this means that 113 is actually more than 110, so we need only one bookcase.

However, we also need to consider the middle shelves can hold 10 books each, so we can use 2 bookcases with the middle shelves holding 10 books each and the bottom shelf holding 20 books each, and the top shelf holding 15 books each.

So, the total number of bookcases Elly needs is 2."
"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost price and the total selling price of the eggs.

First, let's find the total cost price. Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40. 

Total cost price = 5 * $2.40 = $12

Since 1 dozen has 12 eggs, 5 dozens will have 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Now, let's find the total selling price. Rose will sell 3 eggs for $1. 

Total selling price = (60 / 3) * $1 = $20

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost price from the total selling price.

Profit = Total selling price - Total cost price
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

The final answer is: $8"

3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so the number of blue hats is 50 * (3/5) = 30.

The rest of the hats are white, so the number of white hats is 50 - 30 = 20.

Cost after discount: $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Now, we need to convert the cost to cents: $15.00 * 100 = 1500 cents

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we need to divide the total cost in cents by the number of sticks:
1500 cents / 30 sticks = 50 cents per stick

60% of 70 is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions correct.

Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct to pass, we need to find the total number of questions she needs to get right. The total number of questions is the sum of the questions in both tests: 70 + 40 = 110 questions.

70% of 110 is 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions correct.

So far, she has 42 questions correct from the first test. To reach a total of 77 questions correct, she needs to get 77 - 42 = 35 questions correct on the second test.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. We are given that B = 5S - 4. We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so S + B = 116.

We can substitute the expression for B into the second equation: S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know S, we can find B: B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 rooms is 4. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each.

The total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.
The total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

First, we convert the time it takes to deal with a call from minutes to hours: 15 minutes = 15/60 = 0.25 hours.

Now, we divide the total hours Tim spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call: 6 hours / 0.25 hours = 24 calls per day.

To find out how many calls he deals with in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he deals with in a day by 5: 24 calls/day * 5 days = 120 calls.

"To find out how much it will cost Bob to build his project, we need to first determine how many boxes of popsicle sticks he needs to buy. 

Since Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box contains 8 sticks, we can divide 56 by 8 to find out how many boxes he needs:

56 ÷ 8 = 7

So, Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicle sticks. 

Each box costs $2.00, so we can multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box to find the total cost:

7 boxes * $2.00 per box = $14.00

Therefore, it will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project.

The final answer is: $14.00"
"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones. 

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the main phone costs 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation 2x = 20 to find the cost of each additional phone.

Solving for x, we get x = 20 / 2 = 10.

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is 4x = 4 * 10 = 40.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is 20 + 40 = 60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a day and then multiply it by the number of days in June.

Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, Derrick makes 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

The price of each doughnut is $2. So, the total amount of money Derrick makes in a day is 120 * $2 = $240.

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining days.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.
On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so 50 + 20 = 70 people.
On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so 2 * 70 = 140 people.

The total number of people Conor saw on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240 people.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500 people.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 1.5 minutes is 20 + 60 = 80.
4. In the next 30 seconds, the kernels pop at four times the initial rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.
5. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 2 minutes is 80 + 80 = 160.
6. In the final 30 seconds, the kernels pop at half the rate of the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.
7. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 2.5 minutes is 160 + 40 = 200.
8. After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.
9. Therefore, the total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210.

"To find out how many lemons Tim will need, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade he will make. He will make 4 gallons of regular lemonade and 1 gallon of extra tart lemonade. 

Since the extra tart lemonade is twice as tart as the regular lemonade, it will require twice the amount of lemon juice. So, for the extra tart lemonade, he will need 2 cups of lemon juice. 

For the regular lemonade, he will need 4 gallons * 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon = 4 cups of lemon juice. 

In total, he will need 4 cups (for the regular lemonade) + 2 cups (for the extra tart lemonade) = 6 cups of lemon juice.

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, he will need 6 cups * 6 lemons per cup = 36 lemons.

The total amount spent on movie tickets is $7.50 * 2 = $15.
The total amount spent on a bracelet is $8.50.

The total amount spent is $3.50 + $15 + $8.50 = $27.

Janet's parents gave her $40. 

So, the amount of money Janet has left is $40 - $27 = $13.

The final answer is: $13"
"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of days he is open and then multiply that by the number of cars he services per day and his pay per car.

Josh is open 7 days a week, but he is closed on Sunday and Wednesday, so he is open 5 days a week. In 2 weeks, he will be open 5 days/week * 2 weeks = 10 days.

Since Josh services 3 cars a day, in 10 days, he will service 3 cars/day * 10 days = 30 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so in 10 days, he will make 30 cars * $4/car = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many cookies Randy has now, we need to calculate the total number of cookies he had initially and then subtract the ones he ate or gave away, and add the ones he baked.

Initially, Randy had 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. 

Total cookies initially = 9 + 4 + 5 = 18

Randy ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. 
So, he ate 3 cookies in total.

Randy ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch.

Randy gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends.

Randy baked 4 of each flavor for dinner. 
So, he baked 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies Randy ate or gave away: 
3 (snack) + 2 (lunch) + 2 (given away) = 7 cookies

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies Randy baked: 
12 cookies

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies Randy has now: 
Initial cookies - cookies eaten or given away + cookies baked = 18 - 7 + 12 = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get for the first half of the collection and the second half separately, and then add them together.

Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, he can divide them into two equal halves: 6 toy soldiers for the first half and 6 toy soldiers for the second half.

For the first half, he would get 6 toy soldiers * $5 per toy = $30.

For the second half, he would get 6 toy soldiers * $7 per toy = $42.

To find the total amount, we add the two amounts together: $30 + $42 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then determine how many holes Nate fills in per day. 

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, so the net number of holes filled in per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes.

To find out how many days it takes to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled in per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of days by 7 to find the number of weeks: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the average enrollment at Butler High School, we need to calculate 3/4 of the average enrollment at Norman High School. 

3/4 * 4000 = 3000

Now, we need to find the difference between the average enrollment at Norman High School and Butler High School.

4000 - 3000 = 1000

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Number of chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The final answer is: 2325"
"Let's break down the information given:

"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we first need to determine the number of eggs in the second basket. Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as in the first, we multiply the number of eggs in the first basket by 2.

Number of eggs in the first basket: 10
Number of eggs in the second basket: 10 * 2 = 20

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets to find the total.

Total number of eggs: 10 + 20 = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount raised by each girl and add them together.

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430. So, Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. So, Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we add the amounts raised by each girl: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron.
2. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
3. Since Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, Aaron must have run 4 / 2 = 2 miles.
4. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, and Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, we can find Vanessa's time by first finding Aaron's speed. If Aaron runs 2 miles in 16 minutes, his speed is 2 miles / 16 minutes = 1/8 miles per minute.
5. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is (1/8) / 2 = 1/16 miles per minute.
6. To find the time it took Vanessa to run 4 miles, we can divide the distance by her speed: 4 miles / (1/16 miles per minute) = 4 * 16 = 64 minutes.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line

Since he already has 6 feet of new line, we need to subtract that from the total amount of line required.

600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate their daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

Daily revenue = (2 meals * $5 per meal) + $5 bottle of wine
Daily revenue = (2 * $5) + $5
Daily revenue = $10 + $5
Daily revenue = $15

Since they are open 2 days a week, we multiply the daily revenue by 2:
Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * 2
Weekly revenue = $15 * 2
Weekly revenue = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"To find the cost of each watermelon, we first need to find the total selling price of all the watermelons. 

The profit percentage is 25%, which means the selling price is 125% of the cost price (100% + 25% profit). 

The cost price of 50 watermelons is $80. 

Let's find the cost price of 1 watermelon: 
Cost price of 50 watermelons = $80
Cost price of 1 watermelon = $80 / 50
Cost price of 1 watermelon = $1.60

Now, let's find the selling price of 1 watermelon:
Selling price of 50 watermelons = 125% of $80
Selling price of 50 watermelons = 1.25 * $80
Selling price of 50 watermelons = $100
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $100 / 50
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $2

The selling price of each watermelon is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then determine the age of John's youngest son.

First, let's find James' current age. Since James is twice as old as Dora, and Dora will be 12 in 3 years, Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9. Therefore, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18.

Since James is 18 and John had James when he was 19, John is currently 19 - 18 = 1 year older than James. However, we are given that John had James when he was 19, but we are also given that John had his youngest son when he was 32. This means John is 32 - 19 = 13 years older than James. 

However, we know John is 1 year older than James, which is a contradiction. This means the initial information given is inconsistent. However, we can still solve the problem by assuming the information given is correct and John is 13 years older than James. 

Since John is 13 years older than James, and James is 18, John is 18 + 13 = 31 years old. 

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so John's youngest son is 32 - 31 = 1 year old. In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 1 + 3 = 4 years old.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each of them can peel in an hour and then find the difference.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor cost.

The original cost of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, so he pays 20% of the original cost. 
20% of $400 is 0.2 x $400 = $80.

The labor cost is $50 per hour for 3 hours, so the total labor cost is $50 x 3 = $150.

The total cost is the cost of the radiator plus the labor cost: $80 + $150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so we can write the equation:

2C + 4W = 70

We can solve the first equation for W:

W = 20 - C

Now, substitute this expression for W into the second equation:

2C + 4(20 - C) = 70

Expand and simplify:

2C + 80 - 4C = 70

Combine like terms:

-2C + 80 = 70

Subtract 80 from both sides:

-2C = -10

Divide both sides by -2:

C = 5

So, there are 5 chickens on the farm."
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people.
