"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

Now, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. 

So, she makes 9 * 2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we need half of 2 bolts of white fiber, which is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the blue and white fiber bolts together: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we need to first find the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

Let's denote the increased value as x. We can set up the equation: 
80,000 + 50,000 = x + 1.5x (since 150% is the same as multiplying by 1.5)

Combine like terms: 
130,000 = 2.5x

Divide both sides by 2.5: 
x = 52,000

So the total value of the house after the repairs is $52,000. 

To find the profit, we need to subtract the original cost of the house from the new value: 
Profit = 52,000 - 80,000 - 50,000 (the cost of repairs)
Profit = 52,000 - 130,000
Profit = -78,000

However, since Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, we should only subtract the original cost of the house from the new value to find the profit from the sale of the house. 
Profit = 52,000 - 80,000
Profit = -28,000

The negative sign indicates a loss, but since the question asks for the profit, we can ignore the sign and consider the absolute value of the profit. 

The final answer is: $28,000"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

James runs 3 sprints in a session, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 sessions a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to find out the total number of cups of feed she gives her chickens in a day. 

In the morning, she gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens 25 cups of feed. So, the total number of cups of feed she gives her chickens in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi gives her chickens 3 meals a day, and each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per meal, the total number of cups of feed per meal is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, we subtract the total number of cups of feed she gives her chickens in the morning and afternoon from the total number of cups of feed per meal to find out how many cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day. 

60 - 40 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
The fourth glass costs 60% of $1.8, which is 0.6 * $1.8 = $1.08. 
We can see that the cost of each glass decreases by 40% each time. 

The cost of the first glass is $5, the second is $3, the third is $1.8, the fourth is $1.08, the fifth is $0.64, the sixth is $0.384, the seventh is $0.2304, the eighth is $0.13824, the ninth is $0.082944, the tenth is $0.0497664, the eleventh is $0.02986584, the twelfth is $0.017949504, the thirteenth is $0.0107949304, the fourteenth is $0.00648696024, the fifteenth is $0.003876582144, the sixteenth is $0.0023259456896.

Now, we add up the costs of all 16 glasses: 
$5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.64 + $0.384 + $0.2304 + $0.13824 + $0.082944 + $0.0497664 + $0.02986584 + $0.017949504 + $0.0107949304 + $0.00648696024 + $0.003876582144 + $0.0023259456896 = $24.016

The total cost is $24.016."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Seattle has 20 sheep.
- Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
- Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together: 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to calculate the time taken for the first part of the download, the time taken for the restart, and the time taken for the second part of the download.

First, let's find the time taken for the first part of the download. Carla can download 2 GB/minute. The file is 200 GB, so the time taken for the first part of the download is:

Time = Total size / Download speed
Time = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 100 minutes

40% of the file is 200 * 0.4 = 80 GB. Carla has already downloaded 80 GB, so she has 200 - 80 = 120 GB left to download.

The time taken for the second part of the download is:

Time = Total size / Download speed
Time = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 60 minutes

The time taken for the restart is given as 20 minutes.

The total time taken to download the file is the sum of the time taken for the first part of the download, the time taken for the restart, and the time taken for the second part of the download:

Total time = 100 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes
Total time = 180 minutes

The final answer is: 180"
"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled in the first 3 hours and the distance he traveled in the last 4 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time

For the first 3 hours, John drove at 60 mph:
Distance = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

For the first 2 hours of the return trip, John was stuck in traffic, so he didn't move:
Distance = 0 miles

For the next half-hour, John drove at 30 mph:
Distance = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

For the remaining 2.5 hours of the return trip, John drove at 80 mph:
Distance = 80 * 2.5 = 200 miles

Total distance traveled in the return trip = 15 + 200 = 215 miles

Since John was driving back home, we need to subtract the distance he traveled from home to the point where he turned around (180 miles) from the total distance he traveled in the return trip (215 miles) to find the distance he is from home:
Distance from home = 215 - 180 = 35 miles

The final answer is: 35"
"To find Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is $10 * 1.2 = $12/hour. 
So, her earnings for the overtime hours are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings for the week = $400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads from each month together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total revenue it generates each year.

The initial cost of the tree is $90. 

Each year, the tree generates revenue from selling lemons. Since the tree grows 7 lemons per year and each lemon sells for $1.5, the total revenue per year is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

However, it also costs $3 to water and feed the tree each year. So, the net revenue per year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

To find out how many years it will take for the tree to start earning money, we need to find the break-even point, which is when the total revenue equals the initial cost of the tree. 

Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. The total revenue after 'x' years is $7.5x, and the total cost is $90. We set up the equation:

7.5x = 90

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides by 7.5:

x = 90 / 7.5
x = 12

So, it will take 12 years for the tree to start earning money.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with 'x'. So, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.

2. After selling at the green house, she had (x - x/3) = (2x/3) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, she had (2x/3 - 2) vacuum cleaners left.

4. After selling at the red house, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of (2x/3 - 2) is (1/2)(2x/3 - 2) = (x/3 - 1).

5. So, after selling at the orange house, she had (2x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 1)) = (x/3 - 1) vacuum cleaners left.

6. We are given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5.

7. To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation: x/3 = 6.

8. Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for x: x = 18.

"To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students

The remaining students after contemporary dance are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

The remaining students after jazz dance are 16 - 4 = 12 students.

The rest of the students, which is 12, enrolled in hip-hop dance.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To maximize profit, the merchant should choose the item that will increase in value the most. 

First, calculate the increase in value for each item:

Jewelry: 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125
Electronic gadgets: 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96

Since $125 is greater than $96, the merchant should choose the jewelry. 

The profit will be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125."
"Since the problem doesn't specify the speed of the trains, we can assume they travel at the same speed. Let's denote the speed of the trains as 's'. 

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. 

The distance covered by each train in the two days can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, as the two distances form a right-angled triangle. 

Let's denote the distance covered by each train as 'd'. 

d^2 = 80^2 + 150^2
d^2 = 6400 + 22500
d^2 = 28900
d = sqrt(28900)
d = 170

The distance covered by each train in the two days is 170 miles."

"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in 4 weeks and then multiply it by the number of eggs she eats per day.

There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will have 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Claire eats 3 eggs per day, so in 28 days, she will eat 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat.

84 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 7 dozens.

"To find the total time Marissa wants to take to complete the 12-mile trail, we need to divide the total distance by her desired average speed. 

Total distance = 12 miles
Desired average speed = 4 miles per hour
Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles, she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance. 

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance already walked
Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles
Remaining distance = 6 miles

To find the speed needed to walk the remaining distance, we need to divide the remaining distance by the remaining time.

Remaining time = Total time - Time already taken
Remaining time = 3 hours - 2 hours
Remaining time = 1 hour

Speed needed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Speed needed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed needed = 6 miles per hour

"To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. 

Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the remaining one-third is not water. To find the amount of non-water in the orange drink, we subtract the water from the total volume: 10 - 6.67 = 3.33 liters.

Now, we know that 6.67 liters of the orange drink is water. We also spill 1 liter of the orange drink, so the remaining water from the orange drink is 6.67 - 1 = 5.67 liters.

To find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, we calculate three-fifths of 15 liters.

Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Now, we have 5.67 liters of water from the orange drink and 9 liters of water from the pineapple drink. The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 5.67 + 9 = 14.67 liters.

The final answer is: 14.67"

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price.

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since the discount is 25%, the amount of the discount is 25% of 'x', which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so we can set up the equation:

x - 0.25x = 19.50

Combine like terms:

0.75x = 19.50

Now, divide both sides by 0.75 to solve for 'x':

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

"Let's denote the cost of the more expensive pair of heels as x. Since the other pair costs twice as much, the cost of the less expensive pair is 2x.

We know that the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = boots - 5

Combine like terms:

3x = boots - 5

We also know that one pair of heels costs $33, which is the more expensive pair. So, we can set up the equation:

x = 33

Now we can substitute x into the previous equation:

3(33) = boots - 5

99 = boots - 5

Add 5 to both sides:

104 = boots

The boots cost $104.

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We know that G = S + 30. We also know that the total number of coins is 110, so S + G = 110.

Substituting G = S + 30 into the second equation, we get S + (S + 30) = 110. Simplifying this, we get 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2S = 80. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30. G = 40 + 30 = 70.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys. 

60 yogurts / 4 yogurts per set = 15 sets.

"To find out how much money John made from selling the Lego sets, we need to multiply the number of sets by the price per set. 

13 sets * $15/set = $195

Then, we need to find out how much money John spent on video games. 

8 games * $20/game = $160

Since John had $5 left after buying the video games, we can find out how much money he had before buying the games by adding the money he had left to the money he spent on games.

$160 (spent on games) + $5 (left) = $165

Now, we can find out how much money John made from selling the Lego sets by subtracting the money he had before buying the games from the total money he made.

$195 (total made) - $165 (had before buying games) = $30

However, this is the money he made from selling the Lego sets, not the number of sets. To find the number of sets, we need to divide the money he made by the price per set.

$30 / $15/set = 2

So, John still has 13 - 2 = 11 Lego sets left."

John runs 3 hours the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

Total running time = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours

Since John runs 3 days a week, we need to multiply the total running time by 3 to get the total weekly running time. However, we are given that he runs 60 miles a week, so we can directly use the given information.

Total weekly running time = 60 miles / (speed) = 6 hours

Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to find Dana's walking speed first. Since she can skip at half the speed of running and she skips at 3 miles per hour, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour. 

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find the time she spends walking and running. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, the time she spends walking is 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours and the time she spends running is 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours.

The distance she travels while walking is 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles and the distance she travels while running is 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

The total distance she can travel in six hours is 6 + 12 = 18 miles.

The final answer is: 18"

"To find the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone, we need to multiply the original distance by 3. 

Original distance = 400 feet
Distance with gemstone = 400 * 3 = 1200 feet

Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1000 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the javelin. However, we need to find the distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames. 

Distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames = 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many calories you can still consume, subtract the calories you've already consumed from your daily target: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, multiply the number of servings you can still consume by the total weight of the bag: 0.8 * 300 = 240 grams.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total cost. Since Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for 10 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks for 20 candles. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is $10.00. 

Next, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles. The total revenue is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Now, let's find the net profit. The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. The total cost is $10.00, and the total revenue is $40.00. 

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $10.00
Net profit = $30.00

The final answer is: $30.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Total number of articles written in 3 days = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work. To find the total number of Post-it notes she used, we add 80 and 220: 80 + 220 = 300. 

Since she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, we need to subtract 23 from the total number of Post-it notes she used to find out how many she purchased: 300 - 23 = 277.

The final answer is: 277"
"To find the total amount spent on ties, we first need to determine the number of blue ties and the cost of red ties.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per tie:
200 / 40 = 5 blue ties

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is 1.5 times the cost of each blue tie:
1.5 * 40 = 60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties:
10 * 60 = 600

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:
200 + 600 = 800

"To find the total time Tom spent traveling, we need to calculate the time he spent going and coming back. 

First, let's find the time he spent going from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels from 1 to 4 PM, he traveled for 3 hours. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, he travels back at a rate of 6 mph. We need to find the time it takes to cover the same distance of 30 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, the total time Tom spent traveling is 3 hours (going) + 5 hours (coming back) = 8 hours."
"To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the total weight of the comic books he removed. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removed 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books already removed weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys to be removed can be calculated by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday: 6 truck tires * $60 per tire = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday: 4 car tires * $40 per tire = $160
Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Revenue from car tires on Friday: 12 car tires * $40 per tire = $480
Since no truck tires were repaired on Friday, the revenue from truck tires is $0.

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the revenues: $520 (Thursday) and $480 (Friday). Thursday has higher revenue.

He goes on 4 vacations per year, so the total number of quilt blocks is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time it went off and add them up.

The first time it went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add up the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after the 5-year mark and then increase it by 10% for each of the next three years.

Initial salary: $600
Increase after 5 years: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 5 years: $600 + $60 = $660

Now, we need to increase her salary by 10% for each of the next three years:
- Year 6: 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
- Year 7: 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
- Year 8: 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86

So, her salary after three more years of service will be $798.60. 

The final answer is: $798.60"
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as H. Since Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10H.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is given as 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who won't show up by multiplying the total number of invited guests by 1/4.

16 * (1/4) = 16 * 0.25 = 4

So, 4 guests won't show up. To find the number of guests who will attend, we subtract the number of guests who won't show up from the total number of invited guests.

16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of guests who will attend by 0.75.

12 * 0.75 = 9

So, Christina needs 9 gift bags. Each gift bag costs $2, so we multiply the number of gift bags by the cost per gift bag.

9 * 2 = 18

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount eaten by adults and children separately and then add them together.

Adults will eat 20 * 10 = 200 pounds of potato salad.

Children will eat half as much as adults, so they will eat 5 * (10 / 2) = 5 * 5 = 25 pounds of potato salad.

The total amount of potato salad needed is 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

The final answer is: 225"
"Let's break down the information given:

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we first need to determine the total volume of the tomatoes before they were cooked. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and it's half the volume of the tomatoes, the total volume of the tomatoes must be 32 * 2 = 64 ounces.

Since each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can divide the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can to find out how many cans were used: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so we multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total cars originally on the motorway = 30
- 5 cars took an exit, so the remaining cars that drove through the traffic jam = 30 - 5 = 25
- Total cars that drove through the traffic jam = cars in the first 15 minutes + cars in the remaining 15 minutes
- Cars in the remaining 15 minutes = 20

Let's represent the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. Then, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20.

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, we can set up the equation:
x + 20 = 25

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
x = 25 - 20
x = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many plants Mary will have left, we need to first calculate how many plants she has in total, then subtract the number of plants she gives away.

Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she has 2 * 40 = 80 plants.

She received 18 new potted plants, so now she has 80 + 18 = 98 plants.

She will give away 1 plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so she will give away 40 plants.

To find out how many plants she will have left, we subtract the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants: 98 - 40 = 58.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to find the number of doorbell rings for each friend and add them up.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. 
1/4 of 20 is 5, so the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
Since the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

Now, let's add up the number of doorbell rings for each friend:
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately, and then add them together.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one before bed). Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and 1 before bed, but he replaces one of those glasses with a soda. So, he drinks 3 glasses of water on each weekend day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water on weekends.

In total, John drinks 20 glasses of water on weekdays and 6 glasses of water on weekends. So, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is 20 + 6 = 26.

"To find the inner volume of one box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the dimensions of the box and then multiply the resulting dimensions.

The length of the inner box is 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side).
The width of the inner box is 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side).
The height of the inner box is 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side).

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the dimensions: 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Monday and Tuesday: 2 nights * 1 hour/night = 2 hours
- Wednesday: Let's call the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday 'x'. So, the total time watched on Wednesday is 30x minutes.
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes) = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 * 1 hour = 2 hours

Total time watched is 2 + 30x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 hours. 

Converting everything to the same unit (hours), we get:
2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7

Combine like terms:
5.5 + 0.5x = 7

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:
0.5x = 1.5

Divide both sides by 0.5:
x = 3

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.
2. This year, Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so he bakes 2x cookies.
3. However, he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.
4. After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.
5. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110.
6. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 2x = 100.
7. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 50.

"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to break down her sleep into different parts.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

The rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday) she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

There are 5 days in the rest of the week (Tuesday to Sunday), so she slept 7 hours each day for 5 days, which is 7 * 5 = 35 hours.

Now, let's add up all the hours she slept:

First, let's calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours:
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Now, let's calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distances together to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:

500 patients * 24 minutes = 12000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total minutes to hours.

12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The hospital pays the doctors $150 an hour, so the total cost is:

200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour, so the total revenue is:

200 hours * $200/hour = $40000

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $40000 - $30000
Profit = $10000

The final answer is: $10000"
"To find the number of elves left, we first need to find out how many elves quit after the children vomit on them. A third of the 60 elves quit, so we calculate 60 / 3 = 20 elves. 

Now, we subtract the 20 elves who quit from the original 60: 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

Then, 10 more elves quit after kids kick their shins, so we subtract 10 from the remaining 40 elves: 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total expenditure, we need to add the expenditure in May and June. 

Expenditure in May = $500
Expenditure in June = Expenditure in May - $60 = $500 - $60 = $440

The final answer is: $940"
"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides taken by Pam and Fred and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she took a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he took a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides taken by both Pam and Fred is 4 + 6 = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 * 6 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first determine how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked 4 * 6 = 24 miles on Tuesday.

The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We already know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday, so we can subtract these from the total to find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday: 
41 - 4 - 24 = 13 miles.

"To find out how much Tom pays in a year, we need to calculate the total cost of car washes per month and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year).

Tom gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15. 

Total cost per month = 4 car washes/month * $15/car wash = $60/month

Total cost per year = $60/month * 12 months/year = $720/year

The final answer is: $720"
"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we first need to determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially has 20 video games but lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. To find out how many video games Bobby has, we multiply Brian's remaining video games by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 times Brian's remaining video games is 3 * 15 = 45.

5 fewer than 45 is 45 - 5 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"

"To find the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed in both tests and subtract that from the total number of questions in both tests.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 
Time taken to complete the first test = 75 / 5 = 15 hours. 
Since Mark only had 8 hours, he completed 8 * 5 = 40 questions in the first test.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
Time taken to complete the second test = 100 / 5 = 20 hours. 
Since Mark only had 6 hours, he completed 6 * 5 = 30 questions in the second test.

Total questions completed = 40 + 30 = 70

Total questions in both tests = 75 + 100 = 175

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let B be the number of blue gumballs and P be the number of pink gumballs. We are given that B = 12.

We are also given that there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. This can be written as P = 4B + 22.

Substituting the value of B into the equation, we get P = 4(12) + 22.

First, we multiply 4 and 12 to get 48. Then we add 22 to get 70.

So, the number of pink gumballs is 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we need to subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Total number of cars = 20
Number of automatic cars = 12
Number of manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q. 

We know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B. 
We also know that there are twice as many babies as queens, so B = 2Q. 

Since the total number of bees is 700, we can write the equation: W + B + Q = 700. 

Substituting W = 2B and B = 2Q into the equation, we get 2B + B + Q = 700, which simplifies to 3B + Q = 700.

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation to get 3(2Q) + Q = 700, which simplifies to 6Q + Q = 700, or 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100. 

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute Q = 100 into this equation to get B = 2(100), which simplifies to B = 200.

Since W = 2B, we can substitute B = 200 into this equation to get W = 2(200), which simplifies to W = 400.

The final answer is: 400"
"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week, we need to calculate the total hours he would work in a week and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, if he spent his video game time working instead, he would work 2 hours more each day.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours he would work in a week is 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

His hourly wage is $10, so the total amount of money he would earn in a week is 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of food items and non-food items separately and then add them together.

Food items: 
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
Total cost of food items: 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
Total cost of non-food items: 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
Tax = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax to the cost of non-food items:
Total cost of non-food items with tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax:
Total cost = 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left return, which is 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees.
   So, the total number of bees that have left and returned is 30 + 15 = 45.
3. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 leave the hive, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
   So, the total number of bees that have left is now 30 + 60 = 90.
4. The number of bees that have left but not returned is 90 - 45 = 45.
5. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left but not returned come back, which is 45 bees.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy.
- James has four times as many friends as Dorothy.
- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook.

Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can represent the number of Dorothy's friends as x. This means Charlie has 3x friends.

We know Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation: 3x = 12

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 12 / 3
x = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find the number of James' friends. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so James has 4 * 4 = 16 friends.

"To find out who wins the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet for both Steve and Tim. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, we can convert their distances as follows:

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school:

Steve's time: distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes to get home and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve wins the race. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time:

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To find out how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires. 

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and 5 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * 25 cents = 250 cents. 

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and 3 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * 25 cents = 225 cents.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and 1 person came by to get their tire inflated. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1.

The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * 25 cents = 25 cents.

Now, let's add up the total cost of inflating all the tires: 250 cents + 225 cents + 25 cents = 500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 french fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total number of fries eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
   Now, the total number of fries eaten by Dave, the seagull, and the pigeons is 21 + 9 = 30.
4. A raccoon ate two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's call the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it 'x'. 
   After the pigeons ate, the remaining fries are x - 30. 
   The raccoon ate two-thirds of this, which is (2/3) * (x - 30).
   The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (x - 30) - (2/3) * (x - 30).
   Simplifying this, we get (1/3) * (x - 30).
5. After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. 
   So, the remaining fries after the raccoon ate are 5.
   Setting this equal to (1/3) * (x - 30), we get:
   (1/3) * (x - 30) = 5
   Multiplying both sides by 3, we get:
   x - 30 = 15
   Adding 30 to both sides, we get:
   x = 45

"To find the total hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes per day, each lasting 1 hour. So, the total hours per day for these days is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total hours per week for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes per day, each lasting 2 hours. So, the total hours per day for these days is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total hours per week for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week is the sum of the hours for both sets of days, which is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

Next, let's calculate the total length of the croissants: 
120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches

Now, let's calculate the total length of the baguettes. Since each baguette is 2 feet long, we can convert it to inches: 
1 foot = 12 inches, so 2 feet = 24 inches
60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add up the total length of all the baked goods in inches: 
1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 
3360 inches / 12 = 280 feet

Gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
Baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, we add the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. 

To find the total distance Kelly ran, we add the distance she ran back and forth and the distance she ran to the 40-yard line and back. So, the total distance Kelly ran is 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance. So, 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

"To find the total cost of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then add them together.

The cost of one action figure is $5. 
The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.
One red car costs $4.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of toy:
- 5 red cars: 5 * $4 = $20
- 3 action figures: 3 * $5 = $15
- 1 doll: $15

The total cost of all the toys is $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself: 
3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the income she'll lose:
$105 - $90 = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation:

S = 2B

In 2 years, their ages will be B + 2 and S + 2. The sum of their ages will be 28, so we can write another equation:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the second equation, we get:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to first calculate twice the amount of money Ethel has. 

Twice the amount of money Ethel has is 2 * 8 = 16.

"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks in a week. 

There are 7 days in a week. Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, he walks 20 * 5 = 100 miles from Monday to Friday. 

On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, he walks 10 * 2 = 20 miles on the weekends.

The total miles he walks in a week is 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The hat costs $25.

The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.

The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

The final answer is: $150"

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old. So, Sally Four is also 8 years old.
2. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. Since Sally Four is 8 years old, Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.
3. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Since Granny Red is 16 years old, Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, let's find the total age of the four birds:
- Sally Four: 8 years old
- Sally Two: 19 years old
- Granny Red: 16 years old
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years old

Total age = 8 + 19 + 16 + 8 = 51

"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate the total monthly payment and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the increased minimum payments:

- Student loans: $300 * 1.5 = $450
- Credit card: $200 * 1.5 = $300
- Mortgage: $500 * 1.5 = $750

Now, let's add up the increased minimum payments:
$450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

Since Jessica pays this amount every month, we multiply it by 12 to get the yearly amount:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes, then add the time it takes to cut one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)

Total time to peel all potatoes: 60 * 1.5 minutes = 90 minutes
Total time to cut all potatoes: 60 * (5/60) minutes = 5 minutes

Total time to peel and cut all potatoes: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much they made in total from selling lemonade. 

Let's denote the number of gallons they made as 'g'. Since they get 20 glasses per gallon and sell each glass for $0.50, the total amount they made from selling lemonade is 20g * 0.5 = 10g.

The profit they made is $25, which is the total amount they made minus the cost of lemons and sugar. The cost of lemons and sugar is 3g + 2g = 5g. So, the equation becomes:
10g - 5g = 25

Simplifying the equation, we get:
5g = 25

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:
g = 5

Now that we know they made 5 gallons, we can find the cost of lemons. The cost of lemons is 3g, so the cost of lemons is 3 * 5 = 15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the number of Chinese participants, we first need to subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants. 

Total participants = 240
Japanese participants = 80
Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Now, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team was 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls on the Chinese team = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 160 - 60
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 100

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of white carnations first. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and there are 200 pink calla lilies. 

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Then, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x, and we know that 5x = 200. 

To find 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5: 
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. We know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of red roses as 'y'. Then, y = 4x, and we know that x = 40. 
y = 4 * 40
y = 160

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 2, we know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Since Jan is 30 now, two years ago, Jan was 28. Half of 28 is 14. So, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Since Mark was 19 two years ago, Mark is now 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

From point 1, Jean is two years older than Mark. So, Jean is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the total time for the well-rounded team and the less well-rounded team.

The well-rounded team's total time is 4 * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to count the favorable outcomes and divide by the total number of outcomes. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) and 6 total outcomes. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 or 50%.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to count the favorable outcomes and divide by the total number of outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Now, we need to find the difference in probability and express it as a percentage. The difference in probability is 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

"To find the number of rats in each cage, we first need to find the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters) and the total number of straw pieces given to them. 

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of rats is 3r. 

The total number of hamsters is 10. 

The total number of straw pieces given to rats is 3r * 6 = 18r. 
The total number of straw pieces given to hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50. 

The total number of straw pieces given to small rodents is 160. So, the total number of straw pieces given to rats and hamsters is 160. 

We can write the equation: 18r + 50 = 160.

Now, let's solve for 'r'. 
18r = 160 - 50
18r = 110
r = 110 / 18
r = 110 / (2 * 9)
r = 55 / 9

18 * 6 = 108 (less than 110)
Let's try r = 7: 
18 * 7 = 126 (more than 110)

Since 108 is less than 110 and 126 is more than 110, the number of rats in each cage must be between 6 and 7. However, since the number of rats must be a whole number, we can try r = 6.11, which is not a whole number, but we can round it to the nearest whole number. 

However, since we are given that the rats are kept in equal groups, we can try r = 6 and see if it satisfies the equation. If not, we can try r = 7. 

Let's try r = 6: 
18 * 6 = 108 (less than 110)

"To find the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The initial amount owed is $100.
The monthly interest rate is 2% or 0.02.

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

The total interest is $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

The total amount Mandy should pay is the initial amount plus the total interest: $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

Rounded to two decimal places, the total amount is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to first calculate the total cost and total revenue.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x.
The total cost of transporting the bags is $2x.
The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost (buying and transporting). 
So, the profit equation is: 
Profit = Total Revenue - (Total Cost of buying + Total Cost of transporting)
Profit = 30x - (20x + 2x)
Profit = 30x - 22x
Profit = 8x

Given that the profit is $400, we can set up the equation:
8x = 400

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 8:
x = 400 / 8
x = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, they spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75 on food.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he collects peaches and then multiply it by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the total minutes by the peaches collected per minute:

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks needs per day, we first need to find out how many pounds of insects they need per week. Since there are ten ducks and each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we multiply the number of ducks by the amount of insects each duck needs per week.

10 ducks * 3.5 pounds/duck/week = 35 pounds/week

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of insects they need per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total pounds of insects needed per week by 7.

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

"To find the total number of trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees over 10 years, subtract the trees that die, and then add the initial number of trees.

Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net change in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8.

Over 10 years, the net change is 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

So, the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years is 50 (initial trees) + 80 (net change) = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 * 0.3 = 39 trees.

The number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find the number of pink and white flamingos, we need to break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, the number of white flamingos is 6.

The number of pink flamingos left is 18 - 6 = 12.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is 12 + 18 = 30.

The number of white flamingos remains the same, which is 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many crayons Violetta can buy, we need to divide the amount of money she has by the cost of one crayon. 

Money Violetta has: $20
Cost of one crayon: $2

Number of crayons Violetta can buy: $20 / $2 = 10

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color. 

Total number of crayons Violetta will buy: 2 * 5 = 10

Since Violetta can buy 10 crayons and she needs 5 different colors, she will buy 2 of each color. 

The change Violetta will get is the difference between the money she has and the cost of the crayons she buys. 

Cost of crayons: 10 * $2 = $20
Change Violetta will get: $20 - $20 = $0

"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to calculate the total pounds of carrots that will be used by the restaurants and subtract that from the total pounds of carrots available.

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots used = 2 pounds/restaurant * 40 restaurants = 80 pounds

Now, subtract the total pounds used from the total pounds available:

Total pounds available = 200 pounds
Total pounds used = 80 pounds

Pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds available - Total pounds used

New salary = old salary + raise = 2000 + 100 = 2100

Since John got the award on the first day of the year, he will receive the $5000 reward only once. 

Now, let's calculate the total amount he made that year:
Total amount = (new salary * number of weeks in a year) + $5000
Total amount = (2100 * 52) + 5000

"To find out how many pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the total number of pens she had initially and then add the pens she bought.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she had a total of 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, let's add the pens she bought to the pens she already had: 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 66 pens.

Adding these to the initial 32 pens, Janet now has 32 + 66 = 98 pens.

"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply 93 by 6 to get the total score.

Total score = Average * Number of tests
Total score = 93 * 6
Total score = 558

Next, we need to find the total score of the first five tests. We add up the scores of the first five tests.

Score of first five tests = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86
Score of first five tests = 338

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, we need to find the lowest score of the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score after removing the lowest score, we subtract the lowest score from the total score of the first five tests.

Total score after removing the lowest score = Score of first five tests - Lowest score
Total score after removing the lowest score = 338 - 71
Total score after removing the lowest score = 267

Now, we need to find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to get a total score of 558. We subtract the total score after removing the lowest score from the total score needed.

The jacket costs $30 and 2 pairs of shoes cost $20 each, so the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs $70 - $10 = $60 more to buy the jacket and shoes.

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting.

She needs $60 more, but she earns $20 from babysitting, so she still needs $60 - $20 = $40.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we need to divide the remaining amount she needs ($40) by the amount she earns from mowing the lawn ($4).

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We know that W = R + 2.

The total number of eggs collected is 42, and each red chicken produces 3 eggs, while each white chicken produces 5 eggs. So, the total number of eggs can be represented as 3R + 5W = 42.

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42.

Expanding the equation, we get 3R + 5R + 10 = 42.

Combining like terms, we get 8R + 10 = 42.

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 8R = 32.

Dividing both sides by 8, we get R = 4.

Given the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

- Day 1: 100 customers
- Day 2: 50 more customers than Day 1, so 100 + 50 = 150 customers
- Total by Day 3: 500 customers

To find the number of customers on Day 3, we need to subtract the total customers on Day 1 and Day 2 from the total by Day 3.

Customers on Day 3 = Total by Day 3 - (Customers on Day 1 + Customers on Day 2)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - (100 + 150)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - 250
Customers on Day 3 = 250

"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

The rate at which water is leaking from each pool is 4 gallons/minute. Since 4 minutes have passed, the amount of water leaked from each pool is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as y gallons. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y gallons.

We know that the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago (2x) minus the amount of water leaked (16) is equal to the current amount of water in the big pool (4y). So, we can write the equation:

2x - 16 = 4y

Similarly, the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago (x) minus the amount of water leaked (16) is equal to the current amount of water in the small pool (y). So, we can write the equation:

x - 16 = y

We can substitute the expression for x from the second equation into the first equation:

2(x - 16) - 16 = 4y
2x - 32 - 16 = 4y
2x - 48 = 4y

Now, substitute x from the second equation into the above equation:

We know that the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago (2x) minus the amount of water leaked (16) is equal to the current amount of water in the big pool (4y). So, we can write the equation:

2x - 16 = 4y

Similarly, the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago (x) minus the amount of water leaked (16) is equal to the current amount of water in the small pool (y). So, we can write the equation:

x - 16 = y

We can substitute the expression for x from the second equation into the first equation:

2(x - 16) - 16 = 4y
2x - 32 - 16 = 4y
2x - 48 = 4y

Now, substitute x from the second equation into the above equation:

2(y + 16) - 48 = 4y
2y + 32 - 48 = 4y
-16 = 2y
y = -8

However, the amount of water in the pool cannot be negative. This means that the initial assumption that the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago is incorrect. Let's re-examine the problem.

Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn, which is the sum of the cost of the shoes and the belt. 

Total cost = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Since Lori earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours to work = 44

"To find the total amount Janeth will pay, we need to calculate the total interest she will pay over 12 months. 

First, let's find the interest she will pay each month. 10% of $2000 is 0.1 * 2000 = $200. 

Since she will pay $165 a month, the interest she will pay each month is $200 - $165 = $35.

Now, let's find the total interest she will pay over 12 months. $35 * 12 = $420.

The total amount she will pay is the initial amount plus the interest. $2000 + $420 = $2420.

Since she will pay $165 a month for 12 months, the total amount she will pay is $165 * 12 = $1980.

The remaining balance will be the total amount she will pay minus the initial amount. $2420 - $1980 = $440.

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to find their current ages and then add 3 to each age. 

Given that Harriet is 21 years old now, and Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). 

In three years, their ages will be: Harriet (21 + 3 = 24), Zack (42 + 3 = 45), and Adrian (63 + 3 = 66).

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3: (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Naomi scored 68 points. Half of 68 is 34. 10 more than 34 is 44. So Yuri scored 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. Naomi scored 68 points. 17 more than 68 is 85. So Brianna scored 85 points.

Now we know that Naomi scored 68 points, Yuri scored 44 points, and Brianna scored 85 points. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points scored by the four students. 

Total points scored by the four students = 251
Points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197

He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. 
So, the total cost of the add-ons is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.
The total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the total cost of the meal is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.
He has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total cost: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then convert that to hours.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike receives from his remaining 3 pen pals. Since each of them sends 2 letters a week, and there are 3 of them, the total number of letters he receives is 2 * 3 = 6 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to calculate the total minutes he used for his daily calls and the extra minutes, then subtract that from his total minutes.

Daily calls: 15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes
Extra minutes: 300 minutes
Total minutes used: 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in the plan: 
1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

The final answer is: 250"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Griffin initially had 24 fries. Kyle took 5 of them, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin a certain number of fries, let's call it x. After that, Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, 7 + x = 27.

To find the value of x, we need to solve the equation 7 + x = 27. Subtracting 7 from both sides gives us x = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as x. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total hours worked, the total cost before the discount, and then apply the discount.

Total hours worked per week: 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours worked for the movie: 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Total cost before discount: 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

After the movie is done, Jean gets a 10% discount on the total cost. 
Discount amount: 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000
Total cost after discount: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total. 

To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3.

$96 / 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday.
- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
The total calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

The difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to find the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls, the total number of girls in these two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls in the school is 50% of the total number of students. Let's find the total number of students in the school. 

There are 3 classes with 20 students each, so the total number of students is 3 * 20 = 60.

Since 50% of the students are girls, the total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

However, we already know that the total number of girls in the first two classes is 27. So, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% boys, the total number of boys in the school is also 30.

The third class has 20 students, and we know that there are 3 girls in the third class. So, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.
- Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and three fewer cougars than the previous night.

Let's denote the number of cougars Rick killed today as 'x'. Since he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, the number of cougars he killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, the number of wolves he killed today is 3 * 12 = 36.

The total number of wolves killed last night was 10, and today it was 36. So, the total number of wolves killed is 10 + 36 = 46.

The total number of cougars killed last night was 15, and today it was 12. So, the total number of cougars killed is 15 + 12 = 27.

The total number of animals killed is the sum of wolves and cougars, which is 46 + 27 = 73.

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, 30% less than 30 is 30 - 9 = 21. 

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 
So, Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

40 cows / 10 stalls = 4 cows per stall added

Now, each stall has the original 20 cows plus the 4 new cows. 

20 (original cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows per stall

Since we want to know how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8.

24 cows per stall * 8 stalls = 192 cows

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections and then multiply it by the weight of each section. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of 8000 from 8000 to find the final weight. 

30% of 8000 is 0.3 * 8000 = 2400. 

Now, we subtract 2400 from 8000: 8000 - 2400 = 5600.

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we first need to determine how many cups of flour are needed for each day. 

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies Carla is making. 

36 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 3 dozen cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, Carla will need 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour for today.

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. Again, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies she is making.

30 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 2.5 dozen cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, Carla will need 2.5 * 2 = 5 cups of flour for tomorrow.

In total, Carla will need 6 cups of flour for today and 5 cups of flour for tomorrow, which is 6 + 5 = 11 cups of flour.

Two thirds of 9,300 can be calculated as (2/3) * 9,300. 

To calculate this, we multiply 9,300 by 2 and then divide by 3. 

9,300 * 2 = 18,600 
18,600 / 3 = 6,200 

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62.00

"To find out how many cents Kelly has initially, we need to calculate the total value of her quarters and dimes. 

Each quarter is worth 25 cents, and she has 5 quarters, so the total value of her quarters is 5 * 25 = 125 cents. 

Each dime is worth 10 cents, and she has 2 dimes, so the total value of her dimes is 2 * 10 = 20 cents.

The total value of her coins is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, we need to subtract the cost of the pop from the total value of her coins to find out how many cents she has left.

So, 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the number of rows of 5-star, we first need to find the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12. 
The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36. 
Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40. 
Since each 5-star row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5 stars is 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the flagstones, we need to multiply the weight of one flagstone by the number of flagstones. 

Weight of one flagstone: 75 pounds
Number of flagstones: 80

Total weight of flagstones = 75 * 80 = 6000 pounds

Since each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, we need to divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight capacity of the truck to find the number of trucks needed.

Number of trucks = Total weight of flagstones / Weight capacity of the truck
= 6000 / 2000
= 3

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we first need to find the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, its speed is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

The time taken by the car in the fast lane to cover 480 miles is given by the formula: time = distance / speed. So, time = 480 / 60 = 8 hours.

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed, it will take twice the time to cover the same distance. Therefore, the time taken by the car in the slow lane is 8 * 2 = 16 hours.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ali has 22 medals.
2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
4. Together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, which means they have 1/10 of the total medals given out.

Let's represent the total medals given out as 'x'. Then, 1/10 of x is equal to 39. 

To find x, we multiply both sides by 10:
x = 39 * 10
x = 390

The final answer is: 390"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are available in total, we multiply the number of packets by the number of chocolate bars in each packet: 8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars.

Since each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars.

The remaining chocolate bars for the children are 40 - 24 = 16 chocolate bars.

Since there are 8 children, to find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars/child.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the time to minutes first. 

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we multiply the number of intervals by her wage.

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed, we need to first calculate their points after the fourth round.

Initially, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point and still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed: 
Mike has 22 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points. 
The total points of all three players is 22 + 18 + 43 = 83.

"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to determine how many oranges the sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, and he washes 8 oranges. 
The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. 
He washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges initially. 
So, the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3.

"To find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day. 

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 3 meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). So, each person consumes 0.2 * 3 = 0.6 kg of rice per day.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.6 * 5 = 3 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per day (3 kg).

42 kg / 3 kg per day = 14 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many weeks the rice will last by dividing the number of days by 7.

14 days / 7 days per week = 2 weeks

"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold and subtract that from his target.

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he didn't sell any crates on those days. He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 on Tuesday, 12 on Wednesday, and 18 on Thursday.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday)
Total crates sold = 65

Target = 120 crates

Crates off from target = Target - Total crates sold
Crates off from target = 120 - 65
Crates off from target = 55

"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to determine the number of bids made by Carmen and the total amount she paid. 

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so there are 3 other people who bid before her. Since she bids after each of them, she makes 3 bids. 

The first bid is $200, and each subsequent bid is $50 more than the previous one. 

The bids made by the other 3 people are $200, $250, and $300. 

Carmen's bids are $350, $400, and $450. 

The total amount she paid is the sum of these bids: $200 + $50 + $100 + $50 + $100 + $50 + $100 = $650.

The final answer is: $650"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total miles driven, the total cost of driving, and the total bonus given to the driver.

1. Total miles driven: Since John goes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 = 60 miles. 
   Since he goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, the total miles driven per year is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15000 miles.

2. Total cost of driving: He gets charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of driving per year is 15000 * $2 = $30000.

3. Total bonus given to the driver: He gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus given to the driver per year is $150 * 12 = $1800.

4. Total cost per year: The total cost per year is the sum of the total cost of driving and the total bonus given to the driver, which is $30000 + $1800 = $31800.

The final answer is: $31800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process. 

When a piece of paper is folded, it creates two identical halves. 

For a 32-page tabloid, we need to find the minimum number of pieces of paper that can be folded to create 32 pages. 

Since each piece of paper can be folded to create two identical halves, we can start with one piece of paper and fold it to create two halves. 

Now, we have two pieces of paper, but we need 32 pages. We can fold each of these two halves to create four quarters. 

Now, we have four pieces of paper, but we still need 32 pages. We can fold each of these four quarters to create eight eighths. 

Now, we have eight pieces of paper, but we still need 32 pages. We can fold each of these eight eighths to create 16 sixteenths. 

Now, we have 16 pieces of paper, but we still need 32 pages. We can fold each of these 16 sixteenths to create 32 thirty-seconds. 

Since we have 32 thirty-seconds, we have 32 pages. 

However, we started with one piece of paper and folded it multiple times. Each time we folded the paper, we doubled the number of pieces of paper. 

So, to find the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we can use the formula 2^n, where n is the number of times the paper is folded. 

Since we folded the paper 4 times (from one to two, two to four, four to eight, and eight to 16), we can use 2^4 = 16. 

However, this is the number of pieces of paper after the last fold. We need to consider the initial piece of paper as well. 

So, the total number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 16 + 1 = 17."
"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to calculate the amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount.

Annika spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25.
She also spent an additional $10 for rides.

Total amount spent = $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35.

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$50 (initial amount) - $35 (total amount spent) = $15.

"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Since Watson gets a $300 bonus each week, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

April has 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for the month are:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

Since Sandy loses the same amount of weight as Joey in a week, Sandy loses 2 pounds per week.

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey in 4 weeks, we need to divide the total weight lost by Joey in 4 weeks by the weight lost by Sandy in a week.

Weight lost by Joey in 4 weeks = 8 pounds
Weight lost by Sandy in a week = 2 pounds
Time taken by Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey = 8 / 2 = 4 weeks

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is D/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams: 2D + D + D/2.

We are given that the total number of players is 105. So, we can set up the equation:

2D + D + D/2 = 105

To solve for D, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people at the party was 25 + 15 = 40.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. To find out how many people left, we need to calculate 1/4 of 40, which is 40 * (1/4) = 10.

So, 10 people left the party. Since 22 men stayed, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. This means that 10 - 3 = 7 women left the party.

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 left. To find out how many women are left, we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.

"To find the total weakening of the coffee, we need to calculate the weakening caused by the ice cubes and the cream separately, then add them together.

Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we need to find out how many ice cubes are needed to achieve this. 

Let's assume the initial temperature of the coffee is 100 degrees (for simplicity). We want to cool it down to 35 degrees (100 - 65 = 35). 

The temperature difference is 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. So, the number of ice cubes needed is 65 / 13 = 5.

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Since 5 ice cubes are added, the coffee becomes 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker due to the ice cubes.

Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

The total weakening of the coffee is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out the ratio of old records to new records. Since people can trade 2 old records for 1 new one, the ratio is 2:1. 

Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can set up an equation to find the total number of new records traded. Let's assume x is the number of new records traded. Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can set up the equation: x = 7. However, this is not the total number of new records traded, but rather the total number of new records the 5 people left with. 

Since the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1, for every 1 new record, there are 2 old records. So, if 7 new records were traded, then 7 * 2 = 14 old records were traded. However, this is the total number of old records traded, not the number of old records each person brought in. 

Since 5 people came in, we need to divide the total number of old records traded by 5 to find the number of old records each person brought in. 

14 old records / 5 people = 2.8 old records per person. However, since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. 

2.8 old records per person ≈ 2 old records per person. 

Since each person brought in 2 old records, the total number of old records brought in is 5 people * 2 old records/person = 10 old records.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. 
2/5 * 100 = 40 junior programmers.

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, so the total amount paid to junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so they are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

The total amount paid to senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount paid to all programmers is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The final answer is: $224,000"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'. 

Initially, there were x people on the bus. 
At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total became x + 5. 
At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2. 
Then, 8 more people got in, so the total became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6. 
We are given that the total number of people at the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 20. 

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: 
x = 20 - 6 
x = 14 

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many lollipops Oscar has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
2. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
3. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
4. He eats 3 more lollipops that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
5. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first find out how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can find the time it takes to charge 40% by multiplying 40 by 3. 

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 / 60 = 2 hours

"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to first calculate the total number of lollipops she has after her mother gives her 10 more. 

Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so Erin now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we subtract 3 from 17: 17 - 3 = 14.

So, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip, apply the rewards and the coupon to the current shopping trip, and then subtract the total from the amount spent on the current shopping trip.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip, so they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. Since they had 4 rewards, they used $4 off the price. 

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8. 

So, the total discount is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

The amount the customer paid is $43 (spent) - $12 (discount) = $31.

"To find the net pay for Job A, we need to calculate the total income and subtract the taxes. 

Job A income: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year
Job A taxes: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
Job A net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

To find the net pay for Job B, we need to subtract the property tax from the income and then calculate the income tax.

Job B income: $42,000
Job B property tax: $6,000
Job B income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
Job B income tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
Job B net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs, we subtract the lower net pay from the higher net pay.

Difference in net pay: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

The final answer is: $8,400"

"Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. 

So, we can write the equation: 2x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3: x = 70

Since the smallest group has x - 10 students, the number of students in the smallest group is 70 - 10 = 60.

"Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as CH. We know that CH = 2C, since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows. We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so C + CH = 60.

Substituting CH = 2C into the equation, we get C + 2C = 60, which simplifies to 3C = 60. Dividing both sides by 3, we get C = 20.

Now that we know C = 20, we can find CH by substituting C into the equation CH = 2C, which gives us CH = 2 * 20 = 40.

The total number of legs of the cows is 4C = 4 * 20 = 80, and the total number of legs of the chickens is 2CH = 2 * 40 = 80. The total number of legs of all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

2. A pink frog weighs the same as a green toad.
3. A pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
4. A pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
5. A pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
6. A pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
7. A pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:

Weight of the pink frog = 50 pounds
Weight of the blue beetle = 50 pounds
Weight of the green toad = 50 pounds
Weight of the yellow snake = 60 pounds

"To find the percentage increase, we need to first find the difference in the amount they make per day now and the amount they used to make per day.

The factory used to make $100 per tractor and sold 10 tractors a day, so they made $100 * 10 = $1000 per day.

Now, they make $220 per silo and sell 5 silos a day, so they make $220 * 5 = $1100 per day.

The difference in the amount they make per day now and the amount they used to make per day is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100:

Total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours

Since watching shows was 30% of the total time, we can set up the equation: 30% * Total time = 6 hours
To find the total time, we can divide both sides by 30% (or 0.3): Total time = 6 / 0.3 = 20 hours

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
Since there are 'x' friends, the total cost for mini-golf for her friends will be 1 * $5 * x = $5x. 
The cost for Morgan and her friends to ride the go-karts is 2 * $10 * (x + 1) = $20x + $20, because Morgan is also riding the go-karts. 
The cost for arcade tokens is $5. 

The total cost is $5x + $20x + $20 + $5 = $25x + $25. 

The total budget is $90, so we can set up the equation $25x + $25 = $90. 

Subtracting $25 from both sides of the equation gives $25x = $65. 

Dividing both sides of the equation by $25 gives x = 2.6.

"To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we first need to determine how much money he had left after buying the candy. 

Billy started with $10. He spent $1.5 per pound on candy. Let's call the number of pounds of candy he bought 'x'. The total cost of the candy is 1.5x. 

The amount of money he had left after buying the candy is 10 - 1.5x.

He then took half of this amount and spent it on gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05, the total cost of the gumballs is 0.05 * (40 / 2) = 1.

The amount of money he had left after buying the candy is also equal to the amount he spent on gumballs plus the amount he had left after buying the gumballs. So, we can set up the equation: 10 - 1.5x = 1 + (10 - 1.5x - 1) / 2.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 10 - 1.5x = 1 + (9 - 1.5x) / 2.

Multiplying both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction, we get: 20 - 3x = 2 + 9 - 1.5x.

Combine like terms: 20 - 3x = 11 - 1.5x.

Add 1.5x to both sides: 20 - 1.5x = 11.

Subtract 20 from both sides: -1.5x = -9.

Divide both sides by -1.5: x = 6.

Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
Distance from the third city to the first city: 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs)
Total distance in one trip: 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is:
225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles/day

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the distance it travels in a day (675 miles):

Now, let's add up the number of people kicked out for each reason:
- Refusing to wear masks: 3
- Shoplifting: 7
- Physical violence: 21

Total number of people kicked out for these reasons = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31

Since a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
50 - 31 = 19

The final answer is: 19"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Erin now has 14 points. Sara has 8 points. Erin has three times more points than Sara, which means Erin has 3 * 8 = 24 points now. However, we are asked to find out how many points Erin had before. 

Since Erin now has 14 points, and we know she has 24 points now, we can find out how many points she had before by subtracting 14 from 24. 

24 - 14 = 10

So, Erin had 10 points before. 

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors. So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of etching the logo on each frame. The etching costs 20% of the cost of the frame, which is 0.2 * $20 = $4. So, the total cost of etching is 44 * $4 = $176.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins, and each pin costs $5. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers. Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12. So, the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, let's add up the costs: $880 (picture frames) + $176 (etching) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1098.

The final answer is: $1098"
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the materials cost first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

Since making it yourself saves 20%, that means you save 20% of $400. 

20% of $400 = 0.2 * $400 = $80

So, the materials cost for making the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $400 - $80 = $320.

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is the materials cost, which is $320.

The final answer is: $320"
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold on each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday, which is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is 50 * 2 = 100.

The final answer is: 100"

"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest and then divide it by the number of months.

The total interest can be calculated using the formula: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time
Here, Principal = $3,650, Rate = 10% or 0.10, Time = 5 months.

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we add the interest to the principal to get the total amount to be paid: 
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
Monthly Payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly Payment = $1,095

"To find the total profit per hour, we need to first find the total profit and then divide it by the number of hours she spends running the stand.

First, let's find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she bought enough supplies to make 3 pitchers, she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is 36 * $1 = $36.

The cost of the supplies is $18. So, the total profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and each cup is sold for $1, the revenue per hour is 4 * $1 = $4.

The profit per hour is the total profit divided by the number of hours, which is $18 / 36. However, this is not the correct way to find the profit per hour. The correct way is to find the profit per hour by dividing the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade. Since she sells 36 cups in 36/4 = 9 hours, the profit per hour is $18 / 9 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of land as 'x'. Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 of his land left. We are given that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2 to isolate x:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of girls in the choir, we need to calculate 50% of 52, which is 0.5 * 52 = 26 girls.

Since half the people performing can't make it to the show, we need to find half of the number of girls. Half of 26 is 26 / 2 = 13.

The total number of people performing is the number of girls minus the number of girls who couldn't make it, plus the number of teachers. So, the total number of people performing is 26 - 13 + 3 = 16.

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.

First, let's find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

"To find out how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of the rides for Dasha and compare it to the cost of the ride bracelet for David.

Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * $2 = $4.

Dasha buys tickets for 9 rides, so the total cost for her is 9 * $4 = $36.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.

Since they both ride all 9 rides, the cost for Dasha is $36 and the cost for David is $30.

The amount of money David saves is $36 - $30 = $6.

"To find the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. 

The normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $20. 

Since Tim saves 20% by bundling, we need to find 20% of $20. 
20% of $20 = 0.2 * $20 = $4

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, he saves $60 - $26 = $34 by cancelling his cable subscription.

She received 17 cards from family and friends.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has now:

Initial cards + cards received - cards given away = total cards now
20 + 30 - 29 + 17 = 38

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's cards."

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since there are 12 slices, 1/3 of 12 is 12 * (1/3) = 4 slices. 

Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. 1/4 of 12 is 12 * (1/4) = 3 slices.

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so the total number of slices she gave away or ate is 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

- Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.
- He also took 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
- After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps.

So, the total steps Elliott took before his jog would be 5,000 (to and from school) + 1,000 (with his friend) = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, the total steps he took would be 10,000 (goal) - 2,000 (left) = 8,000 steps.

The first package of fireworks costs $400. The second package costs twice that much, so it's 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

He gets a 20% discount on the fireworks. To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.20: $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discount is subtracted from the total cost: $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150. 

The total amount spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate how many cookies she will eat in 30 days. 

Since she eats 2 cookies a night, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of nights in 30 days. 

There are 30 nights in 30 days. 
2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since Shannon's recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make. 

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen cookies

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two conditions.

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50,000 candles smell like wet dog, so the number of candles that smell like wet dog is 0.05 * 50,000 = 2500.

Next, we need to find the number of candles that are more dangerous and have a 1% chance of exploding. However, the problem states that 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of the candles are more dangerous. So, the number of candles that are more dangerous is 0.01 * 50,000 = 500.

However, the problem states that 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog. This means that the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and are more dangerous is 0.05 * 500 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount amount is 30% of the regular price, which is 0.3 * $20 = $6. 

So, the discounted price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The combined total of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 30 + 60 + 15 + 45 = 150 apples.
- Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 150 = 350 apples.
- Since Joanne gathers some apples from the average trees, we need to find out how many apples she gathered from the average trees. Let's denote the number of apples she gathered from the average trees as x.
- The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x.
- Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 500 - 150 = 350 apples.
- So, 45 + x = 350.
- Solving for x, we get x = 350 - 45 = 305.

The final answer is: 305"
"Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We know that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each. 

We are given two pieces of information: 
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each animal has one head, we can write this as C + D = 180.
2. The total number of bumps is 304. Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can write this as 2C + D = 304.

Now we have a system of two equations:
C + D = 180
2C + D = 304

We can solve this system of equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation to eliminate D:
(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know C, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find D:
C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

The number of dromedaries is 56."
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the problem into parts.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days:
Distance = 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled over the next two days, which is 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days:
Distance = 30% * 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

Now, let's add the distance traveled on the next day, which is 0 km (he wasn't traveling at all).

During the second week, he made 300 km every day for 7 days:
Distance = 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up all the distances:
Total distance = 800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The final answer is: 3140"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. This means Zack's locker is 4 times as big as Peter's locker.
   So, Zack's locker = 4 * 5 = 20 cubic inches.
3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. This means Timothy's locker is twice as big as Zack's locker.
   So, Timothy's locker = 2 * 20 = 40 cubic inches.

"To find the elevation where Stanley's comb fell, we need to subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation. 

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation where the comb fell: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation where the comb fell and Oliver's elevation.

Elevation where the comb fell: 6,000 feet
Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital.
2. The first bank gave him $4000.
3. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.
4. So, the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from the banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.
5. To find the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we add the initial capital to the amount he received from the banks: $5000 + $12000 = $16000.

The final answer is: $16000"
"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the steps:

1. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats carried away is 4 * 5 = 20.
   Remaining cats = 50 - 20 = 30

2. 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran, we need to calculate 3/5 of 30.
   Number of cats that ran = (3/5) * 30 = 18

3. Now, we need to find the number of cats left on the rock. 
   Cats left on the rock = Remaining cats - Cats that ran
   Cats left on the rock = 30 - 18 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different price periods.

1. The first 6 months cost $8 per month, so the total cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.
2. The next 8 months cost $12 per month, so the total cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.
3. The remaining months in 2 years (24 months) minus the first 14 months (6 + 8) is 24 - 14 = 10 months. These 10 months cost $14 per month, so the total cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, we add up the costs of all the periods: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The final answer is: $284"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. 
   Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J. 
   We can write the equation: J = T - 6.

2. The total savings is $6. 
   Since Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 2/3 from the tattered jeans. 
   We can write the equation: (1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6.

3. Substitute J from the first equation into the second equation: 
   (1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6.

4. Multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 
   T - 6 + 2T = 18.

5. Combine like terms: 
   3T - 6 = 18.

6. Add 6 to both sides of the equation: 
   3T = 24.

7. Divide both sides of the equation by 3: 
   T = 8.

8. Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans (T = 8), we can find the cost of the jogger jeans (J = T - 6): 
   J = 8 - 6 = 2.

9. The jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

The capacity of the 4 buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
The capacity of the 6 minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
The capacity of the 10 minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, so she has a total of 6 bird feeders.
- The store-bought bird feeders attract 20 birds each day.
- The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each day.

Since there are 3 store-bought bird feeders and 3 homemade bird feeders, we can calculate the total number of birds attracted by each type:

- Store-bought bird feeders: 3 * 20 = 60 birds
- Homemade bird feeders: 3 * 30 = 90 birds

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we add the number of birds attracted by the store-bought and homemade bird feeders:

60 + 90 = 150

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. 
25% of $4 is 0.25 * 4 = $1. 
So, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5. 
The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: 
$4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how many cards he sold. Since he has $50 in spending cash and the ticket costs $100, he needs to make $50 from selling the cards. 

Let's denote the total number of cards as 'x'. Since he sells each card for $1.5, the total amount he makes from selling the cards is 1.5x. However, he keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he sells 2/3 of the cards. Therefore, the amount he makes from selling the cards is 1.5 * (2/3)x = 1x.

We know that he needs to make $50, so we can set up the equation: 1x = 50.

However, this equation is not correct because it doesn't take into account that he keeps 1/3 of the cards. The correct equation should be 1.5 * (2/3)x = 50.

To solve for x, we need to multiply 1.5 by 2/3, which is 1. So the equation becomes x = 50.

However, this is still not correct because it doesn't take into account that he keeps 1/3 of the cards. The correct equation should be 1 * (2/3)x = 50.

To solve for x, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2, which is the reciprocal of 2/3. 

x = 50 * (3/2)
x = 75

So, Kenny started with 75 cards."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many guests were expected to have two hotdogs. Since half of the 36 guests were expected to have two hotdogs, we can calculate this as follows:

36 / 2 = 18

So, 18 guests were expected to have two hotdogs. This means that the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs for these guests.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that the caterer had to provide an additional 40 hotdogs for the extra 4 guests (40 - 36 = 4).

Since the caterer had already prepared 36 hotdogs for the 18 guests who were expected to have two hotdogs, and now he has to provide 40 hotdogs for the 40 guests, we can calculate the total number of hotdogs needed as follows:

36 (initial hotdogs) + 40 (additional hotdogs) = 76 hotdogs

Since the caterer had prepared 36 hotdogs initially, and now he needs 76 hotdogs, we can calculate the number of hotdogs he still needs to prepare as follows:

76 (total hotdogs needed) - 36 (initial hotdogs) = 40 hotdogs

However, we are asked to find the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog. Since 40 guests showed up, and the caterer had prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests to have two hotdogs, we can calculate the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog as follows:

36 (initial guests with two hotdogs) - 4 (extra guests who got a second hotdog) = 32

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to find the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog. Since 40 guests showed up, and 36 guests were expected to have two hotdogs, we can calculate the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog as follows:

40 (total guests) - 36 (guests with two hotdogs) = 4

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

1. The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
2. The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
3. The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total cost of the utensils is 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.
4. The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.
5. To apply the 20% discount, we need to find 20% of $165.00, which is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.
6. The discount amount is $33.00, so we subtract this from the total cost before the discount: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19

Dora has a total of: $2 (her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18

Now, let's subtract the amount of money Dora has from the total cost of the items: $19 (total cost) - $18 (Dora's money) = $1

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to find out how much gas was in each container. 

15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, so each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons of gas.

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, she needed 1/4 * 3 = 0.75 gallons of gas.

To convert gallons to pints, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, 0.75 gallons is equal to 0.75 * 8 = 6 pints.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money George had left after buying the chips and then determine how much he spent on candy bars.

Let's start by finding out how much George spent on chips. Since he bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, the total cost of the chips is 3 * 40 = 120 cents or $1.20.

George had 1% of his money left, which means he spent 99% of his money. Let's represent the total amount of money George had as 'x'. Then, 99% of x is equal to the amount he spent on chips, which is $1.20. 

We can set up the equation: 0.99x = 1.20

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.99: x = 1.20 / 0.99 = 1.2121 (round to 2 decimal places). 

Since George spent $5, we can verify that 1.2121 * 5 = 6.0605, which is close to 6. So, George had approximately $6.

Now, let's find out how much money George spent on candy bars. He spent $5 and had $6 initially, so he had $1 left after buying the chips. Since he had 1% of his money left, he spent 99% of his money, which is $5.

The cost of each candy bar is 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is 5 / 0.75 = 6.6667 (round to 4 decimal places).

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 6 candy bars with $5, and the remaining 0.6667 dollars is not enough to buy another candy bar."
"To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we need to subtract the lollipops Ray kept from the total and then divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5, so the remaining lollipops are 25 - 5 = 20.

He shared the remaining lollipops with 4 friends, so each friend received 20 / 4 = 5 lollipops.

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

They are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, including themselves, so the total number of people sharing the oranges is 8.

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people = 56 / 8 = 7

"To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to determine how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then add 5 minutes to that time.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne's 4-minute drive. So, Bernadette needs to leave 4 - 5 = -1 minute before Wayne. However, since Bernadette can't leave a negative amount of time before Wayne, we need to calculate how much earlier she should leave in total.

Since Bernadette's drive is 16 minutes, and she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne, she should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before the event. However, this is the time she needs to leave before the event starts, not before Wayne leaves. Since Wayne leaves 4 minutes before the event, Bernadette should leave 21 - 4 = 17 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. Since the area of the room is given as 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length to feet. 

1 yard = 3 feet
So, 3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:
Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room:
Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads they bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Difference in beads = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has

"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

Marcus bakes for 3 hours, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase due to the oven is 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.

The window is open for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open, so for 30 minutes, it cools down 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. The temperature increase due to the oven is 15 degrees, and the temperature decrease due to the open window is 6 degrees. 

So, the final temperature of the house is 40 + 15 - 6 = 49 degrees.

"To find the time it took James to do the run, we first need to find the total time it took James to complete the triathlon. 

First, let's convert Jon's times to minutes: 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's find James' time for the swim. James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. 
10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. 
So, James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

James' bike time is 5 minutes longer than Jon's, so it is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, we can find James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time: 
180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to calculate the distance it runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, we need to convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 

Distance = Speed * Time = 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

To find out how many points Marcy has after her turn, we need to add the points she scored to her initial points.

Marcy's initial points: 225
Points scored by Marcy: 10
Marcy's total points after her turn: 225 + 10 = 235

Now, we need to find the difference between Joey's total points and Marcy's total points to determine by how many points Joey is winning.

Difference: 240 - 235 = 5

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's find the revenue from the flash sale on Monday:
17 sneakers were sold for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 x $20 = $340

Next, let's find the revenue from the sale to the department store:
The salesman had 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.
These were sold for $25 each, so the revenue from the department store sale is:
31 x $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store sale:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The initial cost of the sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The final answer is: $539"
"To find the total number of crayons, we need to calculate the number of crayons in the packets with 8 pieces and the number of crayons in the packets with 16 pieces, then add them together.

The number of crayons in the packets with 8 pieces is 6 * 8 = 48.
The number of crayons in the packets with 16 pieces is 4 * 16 = 64.

Now, we add the number of crayons in both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

The final answer is: 112"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra.
2. The regular price of a soda is $3.
3. You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of the popcorn and soda together must be $2 more than the cost of the super ticket. 

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and the extra cost of the popcorn and soda is $1. So, the total cost of the popcorn and soda is $20 + $2 = $22.

Since the soda costs $3, the cost of the popcorn is $22 - $3 = $19.

The regular price of popcorn is $19.

The final answer is: $19"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, the cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. To find the cost per balloon, we divide the total cost by the number of balloons:

Cost per balloon = Total cost / Number of balloons
= $900 / 20
= $45

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:

New cost per balloon = Old cost per balloon + Increase in cost
= $45 + $20
= $65

Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new rate:

Total cost = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
= $65 * 170
= $11,050

The final answer is: $11,050"
"To find the average speed, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed * Time
For the first part of the trip: Distance = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles
For the second part of the trip: Distance = 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles
Total distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average speed = 50 mph

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies separately and then add them together.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires is:
8 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $6400

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she now has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.
The value of the 3 sapphires she traded is:
3 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $2400

The value of the 2 rubies she received is:
2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400

Now, let's add the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies:
$6400 (sapphires) + $2400 (value of traded sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $11200

The total value of Jenna's jewels is $11200.

The final answer is: $11200"
"To find the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day, so together they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, we multiply the total number of apples they eat per day by 30:

8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one bed is length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since there are 10 beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the total number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we first need to find the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of red cards = 15
60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24 = 39

The total number of cards is the sum of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

"To find the number of fairies remaining, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

After 20 minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means 50 / 2 = 25 fairies joined the group.

So, the total number of fairies now is 50 (initial fairies) + 25 (new fairies) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. 

The number of fairies remaining is 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has and the number of puppies Brandon's dog has. 

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. 
Total puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies that have spots. 
Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 
Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies that have spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the weight of each type of feed and add them together.

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Total weight of feed = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips.

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
= 3400 / 2250
= 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns in a week, we need to calculate the total amount from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

For aluminum cans: 
Grayson drinks 3 cans a week. Each can is worth 2 cents. 
So, 3 cans * 2 cents = 6 cents per week from aluminum cans.

For plastic bottles: 
Grayson drinks 5 bottles a week. Each bottle is worth 3 cents. 
So, 5 bottles * 3 cents = 15 cents per week from plastic bottles.

Total earnings per week = 6 cents (aluminum) + 15 cents (plastic) = 21 cents per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly earnings by 4 to find the total earnings in a month:
21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we first need to determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

60% of 10 = 0.6 * 10 = 6
Toni has 10 + 6 = 16 plants

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate Shondra's plants as follows:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

Number of cookies = (1/2)x + 2

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we'll convert the remoras' length from inches to feet. 

1 foot = 12 inches
6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet

There are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. 

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / length of shark) * 100

"To find out how many days Jason has to walk in total, we need to multiply the number of weeks by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week). 

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Since Jason can walk 4 days a week, we need to find out how many days he has to walk in total in 3 weeks. 

21 days / 3 weeks = 7 days/week * 3 weeks = 21 days, but he can only walk 4 days a week, so we need to find out how many days he has to walk in total in 3 weeks. 
21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days. 

Now we know Jason has to walk 21 days in total. 

To find out how long he has to spend walking each day, we need to divide the total number of minutes by the total number of days. 

240 minutes / 21 days = 11.42857 minutes/day 

Since Jason can't walk a fraction of a minute, we can round down to 11.43 minutes/day."

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to find the total number of kids allergic to at least one thing and subtract that from the total number of kids in the class.

First, let's find the total number of kids allergic to at least one thing. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to do this.

Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts = (Number of kids allergic to dairy) + (Number of kids allergic to peanuts) - (Number of kids allergic to both)
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

However, this counts the kids allergic to both twice, so we need to subtract them once to avoid double-counting.

Number of kids allergic to at least one thing = 12

Now, we can find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything by subtracting the number of kids allergic to at least one thing from the total number of kids in the class.

Number of kids not allergic to anything = Total number of kids - Number of kids allergic to at least one thing

Heather also has a $2.00 coupon, so she will get a discount of $2.00.

The total cost of 1 pack of razors after the discount is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, the cost of each individual razor is $2.00 / 4 = $0.50.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them up.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each, so their total height is 4 * 64 = 256"".

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 3 * 64 = 192"".

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128"".

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 536"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 536"" / 12 = 44.67 feet.

The final answer is: 44.67"
"To find the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she walked in a day and then multiply it by the number of days she worked.

Charisma walks 5 minutes every hour. Since she works 8 hours a day, she walks 5 * 8 = 40 minutes every day.

After 5 days, she will have walked 40 * 5 = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In four years, Brett will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.
2. At that time, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now, which is 3 * 14 = 42 years old.
3. Since Angela will be 42 years old in four years, we need to subtract 4 from 42 to find her current age: 42 - 4 = 38.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is 14 days * $6 per day = $84.

The cost of the afternoon rides is 14 days * $2 per day = $28.

The total cost is $84 + $28 = $112.

The final answer is: $112"
"To find out how many pies they can make, we need to calculate the total number of oranges they have and then divide that by the number of oranges needed for one pie.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she has 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

One Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, so they can make 120 / 3 = 40 pies.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost). 
The cost of the second venue is $25x (per person charge).

To find the number of guests where the two venues are equal in cost, we set the two costs equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, the number of insects David found is B/2. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so the number of insects Lily found is B/2 + 7.

We are also given that together they collected 43 insects. So, the sum of the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. 

We can write the equation as: B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms: B + B = 2B, and 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So the equation becomes: 2B + 1(B) + 7 = 43

Combine like terms: 3B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3B = 36

Divide both sides by 3: B = 12

Now that we know Bodhi found 12 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: B/2 = 12/2 = 6

And the number of insects Lily found is B/2 + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13

The final answer is: 13"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. So, the yards used by Mariah are:
1/4 * 364 = 91 yards

Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. So, the yards used by her grandma are:
1/2 * 364 = 182 yards

Now, let's add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together:
91 + 182 = 273 yards

The final answer is: 273"
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the number of gifts for her friends and add the 10 random gifts.

2 friends want 5 gifts each, so the total number of gifts for these friends is 2 * 5 = 10.
3 friends want 2 gifts each, so the total number of gifts for these friends is 3 * 2 = 6.
The total number of gifts for all friends is 10 + 6 = 16.
Adding the 10 random gifts, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is 16 + 10 = 26.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.
- 2 packs are strawberry gum.
- 1 pack is grape gum, which costs $2.
- 1 pack is green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum, so it costs $2 / 2 = $1.
- The total cost is $7.

We know that the total cost is the sum of the costs of all the packs of gum. Let's denote the cost of each strawberry pack as 'x'. Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, their total cost is 2x.

The total cost of the grape gum is $2, and the total cost of the green apple gum is $1. So, the total cost of all the packs of gum is 2x + 2 + 1 = 3x + 3.

Since the total cost is $7, we can set up the equation: 3x + 3 = 7.

To solve for x, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 7 - 3, which simplifies to 3x = 4.

Then, we divide both sides by 3 to find x: x = 4 / 3.

x = 1.33

The final answer is: $1.33"
"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar spent. 

A 2 x 4 gives 200 sticks for $4, so the cost per stick is $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick. 
A 2 x 8 gives 400 sticks for $6, so the cost per stick is $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick.

Since a 2 x 8 gives more sticks per dollar, we will use this type of wood. 

Now, we need to find out how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with $24. 
$24 / $6 = 4, so he can buy 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood.

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks, 4 pieces will give 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost, we need to first find the total number of snowshoes needed. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24. Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes needed is 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of snowshoes needed by the cost per pair. The total cost is 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To find out how much Janet spends on bus trips in a week, we need to multiply the cost of one bus trip by the number of bus trips she takes in a week. 

Cost of one bus trip: $2.20
Number of bus trips in a week: 5

Total weekly cost of bus trips: $2.20 * 5 = $11.00

Now, we need to find out how much she would save by buying a weekly bus pass for $20. 

Weekly bus pass cost: $20
Weekly bus trip cost: $11.00

Amount saved: $20 - $11.00 = $9.00

"Let's break down the information given:

- The farm has 30 cows.
- The zoo has 20 sheep.
- The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
- The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo:
- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

The total number of animals at the farm and the zoo combined is 40 + 80 = 120.

"Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'. We know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. So, the number of onions Rose bought is 4x and the number of potatoes she bought is 4y.

We are given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. This can be represented as:

4x = 12
4y = 4

To find the values of x and y, we can solve these equations:

4x = 12
x = 12 / 4
x = 3

4y = 4
y = 4 / 4
y = 1

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. 

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 3 + 1 = 4."
"To find the number of days Andy has to lose the weight, we need to calculate the difference between his birthday and today. 

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to January 1st is 1 day. 
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. 
February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. 
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. 
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days. 
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days. 
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days. 
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total days = 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 171 days

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 lb, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 
105,000 / 171 ≈ 613.5

First, Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes. 
20% of $500 = 0.2 * $500 = $100

Now, Julie has $500 - $100 = $400 left.

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining money on CDs.
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, Julie has $400 - $100 = $300 left.

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000

Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x = 3 * 30,000 = 90,000

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to first find out how many cups of raisins she has available for the oatmeal cookies. 

Since she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, she will have 1/3 of the raisins for the oatmeal cookies. 

1/3 of 27 cups of raisins is 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins for the oatmeal cookies.

Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we need to divide 9 cups by 3/4 to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make.

To divide 9 by 3/4, we multiply 9 by the reciprocal of 3/4, which is 4/3.

9 * 4/3 = 36/3 = 12

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device, then multiply it by the cost per kilowatt hour.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. 

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour.

Since there are 7 days in a week, her weekly consumption before adding the new device is 12 * 7 = 84 kilowatts per hour. 

Her weekly consumption after adding the new device is 14 * 7 = 98 kilowatts per hour.

The cost per kilowatt hour is $1.50. 

So, her weekly bill before adding the new device is 84 * $1.50 = $126.

Her weekly bill after adding the new device is 98 * $1.50 = $147.

2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.
5. To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have: 20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 64 (Jenna's sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 152.

"Let's break down the information given. Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set for an unknown price. The total cost was $48. 

Let's denote the price of the headphone set as 'x'. We can set up the equation as follows:

4 + x = 48

To find the price of the headphone set, we need to subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

x = 48 - 4
x = 44

Now that we know the price of the headphone set, we can find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he had not bought the headphone set. 

Let's denote the number of CDs Tom could have bought as 'y'. We can set up the equation as follows:

4y = 48

To find the number of CDs Tom could have bought, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 4:

y = 48 / 4
y = 12

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he had not bought the headphone set. We know that Tom could have bought 12 CDs with the money he saved by not buying the headphone set. 

The price of the headphone set was $44, so Tom saved $44 by not buying the headphone set. 

Let's denote the number of CDs Tom could have bought with the saved money as 'z'. We can set up the equation as follows:

4z = 44

To find the number of CDs Tom could have bought with the saved money, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 4:

z = 44 / 4
z = 11

6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

For the weeks where he spent 5 hours, there are 2 weeks.
2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

For the week where he spent 6 hours, there is 1 week.
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

"To find the number of passengers after the second stop, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus, so 5 * 8 = 40 people get in. 
Now, the total number of passengers is:
40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 3 times 21 is 63, but since it's 3 times fewer, we subtract 63 from 21 to get the number of passengers who got in, which is 21 - 63 = -42. However, since you can't have a negative number of passengers, this means that 63 is 3 times more than the number of passengers who got in. So, we need to divide 63 by 3 to get the number of passengers who got in, which is 21. 

Now, the total number of passengers is:
59 (left) + 21 (got in) = 80

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.
   Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years.
   So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.
3. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.
4. The difference in their current ages is 47 - 22 = 25 years.

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
2. The computer cost $1,100.
3. The printer cost $400 less than the computer.

First, we need to find the cost of the printer. Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer:
$1,100 - $400 = $700

Now we know the cost of the printer is $700. To find the total cost of the computer and the printer, we add their costs:
$1,100 + $700 = $1,800

Since the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400, we subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total to find the cost of the 2 monitors:
$2,400 - $1,800 = $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we divide the cost of the 2 monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor:
$600 / 2 = $300

The boys brought 60 shells each, so the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells more than the boys.

So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is 600 + 300 = 900.

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells brought by each girl is 900 / 10 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Nick had twice as many candies as George. Let's say George had x candies. Then, Nick had 2x candies.
2. George ate 5 candies, so now George has x - 5 candies left.
3. We are given that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 3
4. Solving for x, we get: x = 8
5. Since Nick had 2x candies initially, and x = 8, Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Anne's age, we need to find Alyana's age first. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6 years.

Then, we need to find Anne's age, which is 2 years older than Alyana's age. So, Anne's age is 6 + 2 = 8 years.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188

The final answer is: 188"
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she aims to make.

Emma made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

Total vlogs made so far = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Total vlogs Emma aims to make = 72

Vlogs left to make = 72 - 54 = 18

So, Emma should make 18 vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total amount you paid, first, calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill. 

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

Total amount = $50 (bill) + $10 (tip) = $60

You ended up paying $60."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The eldest boy's initial share is $18 / 3 = $6.
2. He added $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11.
3. He added another $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.
4. He spent $8, so he now has $21 - $8 = $13.
5. He tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8, so he now has $13 * 3 = $39.

The final answer is: $39"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Elvis needs to save in the first half of the month. 

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of the month is x. Then, the number of days in the second half of the month is also x (since the month has 30 days, the first half has 15 days and the second half has 15 days).

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves in the first half as y. Then, the amount he saves in the second half is 2y.

The total amount Elvis needs to save in the month is $1125. So, we can set up the equation:

x * y + x * 2y = 1125

Combine like terms:

3xy = 1125

Divide both sides by 3x:

y = 1125 / (3x)

Since x is the number of days in the first half of the month, and we know that the first half of the month has 15 days, we can substitute x = 15 into the equation:

y = 1125 / (3 * 15)
y = 1125 / 45
y = 25

Now that we know Elvis saves $25 in the first half of the month, we can find out how much he needs to save in the second half of the month, which is twice as much as the first half:

Amount saved in the second half = 2y
= 2 * 25
= 50

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the total cost of the fruits, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of 3 apples at $1.50 each is 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of 5 oranges at $0.80 each is 5 x $0.80 = $4.
The cost of 6 peaches at $0.75 each is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them will get and then find the difference.

Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, and he finished 20 tasks. 
Jairus' total = 0.8 * 20 = $16

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, and she finished 20 tasks. 
Jenny's total = 0.5 * 20 = $10

Now, we need to find the difference between Jairus' total and Jenny's total.
Difference = Jairus' total - Jenny's total = 16 - 10 = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"Let's denote the amount Brad gets as x. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x.

The total amount they have is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation: x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms: 5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5: x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4 * 20 = 80

The final answer is: $80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works.

Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the total miles he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 = 6 miles.

Since he works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is 6 * 5 = 30 miles.

3. So, the total number of letters written so far is 52 + 13 = 65 letters
4. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written: 65 letters

Total number of letters Elise has written: 65 + 65 = 130"
"To find the number of families notified in the fourth round, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. 

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 
In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so 3 * 3 = 9 families are notified. 
In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so 9 * 3 = 27 families are notified. 
In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so 27 * 3 = 81 families are notified.

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and then add that to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight he lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Now, we add the weight he lost to his final weight to find his initial weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first determine the total number of toys in the larger play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys and the larger play set is five times larger, we can calculate the total number of toys in the larger play set as follows:

Total toys in larger play set = 5 * 80 = 400

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make this larger play set, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + 2 = 400

where x is the number of toys Jonathan currently has.

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys. 

The final answer is: 398"

"Let's break down the information given:

- When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
- When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water.

First, let's find out how long Ray takes to swim a mile in warm water. Twice the time in cold water is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Two minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long Ray takes to swim 3 miles in cold water and warm water.

- In cold water, Ray takes 16 minutes to swim a mile. So, for 3 miles, it would be 16 * 3 = 48 minutes.
- In warm water, Ray takes 34 minutes to swim a mile. So, for 3 miles, it would be 34 * 3 = 102 minutes.

"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to find the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference is 468 - 450 = 18.
The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4%, we need to find the temperature that is 4% less than 520.

First, we find 4% of 520: 0.04 * 520 = 20.8.

Then, we subtract 20.8 from 520 to get the temperature Maggie should set: 520 - 20.8 = 499.2.

The final answer is: 499.2"
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 1 hour to 60 minutes. Adding 30 minutes to that gives us 60 + 30 = 90 minutes for the first movie.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours to minutes gives us 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. Adding 5 minutes to that gives us 120 + 5 = 125 minutes for the second movie.

Now, we add the time for both movies together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

The final answer is: 215"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price.

Herb's house price = $76,000
30% of Herb's house price = 0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800
Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
= $76,000 - $22,800
= $53,200

Now, we need to find the combined value of the two houses.
Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
= $76,000 + $53,200
= $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.
- She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.
- Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 + 20 = 60 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes Judy brought: 
Judy's cups: 12
Judy's dishes: 24
Total Judy brought: 12 + 24 = 36

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes her friend brought: 
Friend's cups: 40
Friend's dishes: 60
Total friend brought: 40 + 60 = 100

Now, let's add the total number of cups and dishes brought by Judy and her friend: 
Total Judy brought: 36
Total friend brought: 100
Total brought by both: 36 + 100 = 136

"To find the total number of contacts, we multiply the number of contacts per box by the number of boxes: 90 contacts/box * 2 boxes = 180 contacts.

Since the contacts will last Pete 45 days, we can find the number of contacts he uses per day: 90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts/day.

To find the total number of days the 2 boxes will last, we multiply the number of days per box by the number of boxes: 45 days/box * 2 boxes = 90 days.

Since Pete uses 2 contacts per day, the total number of contacts he will use in 90 days is 2 contacts/day * 90 days = 180 contacts.

Since he buys 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 boxes * $100.00/box = $200.00.

The discount is 10% of $200.00, which is 0.1 * $200.00 = $20.00.

The final cost after the discount is $200.00 - $20.00 = $180.00.

Since Pete uses 180 contacts in 90 days, we can find the cost per contact: $180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact.

Since there are 2 contacts in a pair, the cost per pair of contacts is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per pair.

The final answer is: $0.50"
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate the total hours they worked and multiply it by their hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so she worked a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. In total, John worked 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Since they both earn $10 an hour, Jill earned 3 * $10 = $30 and John earned 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many calories Hannah burns in total, we need to calculate the calories burned during aerobics and running. 

Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink 100 ml of water.

Total calories burned: 1600
Divide by 200: 1600 / 200 = 8

So, Hannah needs to drink 8 * 100 ml of water.

The final answer is: 800"
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans) and G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans).

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3.01B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3.01:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:

G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to add the three measurements and divide by 3.

First, let's find the third measurement: 
Jared's initial speed is 47 WPM, and he increases it by 5 WPM, so his new speed is 47 + 5 = 52 WPM. 
However, the problem states that the next time he tests his typing speed, it has increased to 52 WPM. This means that the 52 WPM is the second measurement. 
So, the third measurement is 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM.

Now, let's add the three measurements: 
47 WPM + 52 WPM + 57 WPM = 156 WPM

To find the average, we divide the sum by 3:
156 WPM / 3 = 52 WPM

The final answer is: 52"
"To find the difference in weight, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then subtract the weight gained from the weight lost.

Weight lost per week: -1.25 pounds
Weight gained per week: 1.75 pounds

For 5 weeks, the weight change for each option is:
Weight lost: -1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = -6.25 pounds
Weight gained: 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

The difference in weight is the weight gained minus the weight lost: 
8.75 pounds - (-6.25 pounds) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of people attending, we need to calculate the number of people invited via email, the number of friends Alex's friends will bring, and the number of Alex's friends and their spouses.

First, let's calculate the number of people invited via email. Each of the 100 people invited will bring 2 friends, so the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

Next, Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them will bring their spouses, so the total number of Alex's friends and their spouses is 10 + 8 = 18.

Now, we add the number of people invited via email and the number of Alex's friends and their spouses to get the total number of people attending. 

Total number of people = 300 + 18 = 318

However, we also need to include Alex herself, so the total number of people is 318 + 1 = 319.

"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to find the weight of the Papillon first, then multiply it by 44.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The cost of the boots on eBay is $13. 
The shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

So, the total cost of the boots on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

The total cost of the boots on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet, given that it starts at 4 feet and doubles in height every day.

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, so we can write the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown, and then subtract the deposit he has already paid.

The base price of each implant is $2000. Since George needs 2 implants, the total base price is 2 * $2000 = $4000.

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already paid a deposit of $600. To find out how much he still needs to pay, we subtract the deposit from the total cost: $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour at work, to find out how many hours he needs to work to pay for the dental work, we divide the amount he still needs to pay by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, it is 3x.

The sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. 
One angle is 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees.
The other angle is 3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

8 quarters = 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
6 dimes = 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

Total amount of money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball
= 345 cents / 5 cents

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how many pounds he makes in an hour, we divide 120 by 2. 
120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour. 
3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, we know that Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour and Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour. They both work for 12 hours a day. 

Ruiz's total production in 12 hours = 60 * 12 = 720 pounds
Marissa's total production in 12 hours = 45 * 12 = 540 pounds

Total production of both Ruiz and Marissa = 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds

However, 20 street lights are not working. To find the total number of functioning street lights, we subtract the non-working lights from the total: 96 - 20 = 76.

The final answer is: 76"
"To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played, we need to add the number of times each DVD has been played and then subtract that total from the maximum number of times a DVD can be played (1000).

DVD 1 has been played 356 times, and DVD 2 has been played 135 times. 

Total times played so far = 356 + 135 = 491

Since each DVD can be played 1000 times, we subtract the total times played so far from 2000 to find the remaining times both DVDs can be played.

Remaining times = 1000 - 491 = 509

The final answer is: 509"
"To find the total cost of the physical therapy, we need to calculate the total number of hours John attended physical therapy and then multiply it by the cost per hour.

John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks, and each week he went twice for 2 hours at a time. So, the total number of hours he attended physical therapy is:
6 weeks * 2 sessions per week * 2 hours per session = 24 hours

The cost per hour is $125. Therefore, the total cost of the physical therapy is:
24 hours * $125 per hour = $3000

The final answer is: $3000"
"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim chews at school, we need to calculate how many 2-hour periods are in an 8-hour school day. 

8 hours / 2 hours per period = 4 periods

Since Jim chews 1 piece of gum per period, he chews 4 pieces at school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

Total pieces chewed = 4 (at school) + 2 (on the way home and after dinner) = 6 pieces

Jim started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

His sister asks for half of the remaining gum, so he gives her 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

Now, we add 4 to her current age to find her age 4 years from now: 
4 + 4 = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach and then find the difference.

The baseball coach bought 9 new baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent by the baseball coach is:
9 x $3 = $27

The basketball coach bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent by the basketball coach is:
8 x $14 = $112

Now, let's find the difference between the two amounts:
$112 - $27 = $85

"To find the total number of flowers that have bloomed, we need to first find the total number of flowers in the garden. 

There are 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row. So, the total number of flowers is 10 * 20 = 200.

Since only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we need to multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5.

4/5 * 200 = (4 * 200) / 5 = 800 / 5 = 160

So, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s and then multiply it by the number of seconds in an hour.

1 Mb = 1000 kb
Ashley's speed in kb/s = 20 kb/s

To convert kb/s to Mb/s, we divide by 1000:
Ashley's speed in Mb/s = 20 / 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

There are 3600 seconds in an hour. To find Ashley's speed in Mb/h, we multiply her speed in Mb/s by the number of seconds in an hour:
Ashley's speed in Mb/h = 0.02 Mb/s * 3600 s/h = 72 Mb/h

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars, then calculate his commission on that profit.

First, let's find the total cost of the cars: 
10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000

The company paid 30% of the cost to acquire the cars, so the amount they paid is:
$250,000 * 0.3 = $75,000

The profit from selling the cars is the selling price minus the cost to acquire them:
Profit = Selling price - Cost to acquire
Profit = $250,000 - $75,000
Profit = $175,000

James got a 10% commission on the profit:
Commission = Profit * 0.1
Commission = $175,000 * 0.1
Commission = $17,500

So, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of men who can stay upright, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply 100 by 0.25 to get the number of riders who can stay upright: 
100 * 0.25 = 25

Next, we need to find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply 25 by 0.6 to get the number of women who can stay upright:
25 * 0.6 = 15

Now, we need to find the number of men who can stay upright. Since there are 25 riders in total who can stay upright and 15 of them are women, the number of men who can stay upright is 25 - 15 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to find the price of the gold and silver jewels first.

Given that the price of a diamond Jewell is $2000, and the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond Jewell, we can calculate the price of the gold Jewell as follows:

Price of gold Jewell = (4/5) * Price of diamond Jewell
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold, so we can calculate the price of the silver Jewell as follows:

Price of silver Jewell = Price of gold Jewell - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond Jewell + Price of gold Jewell + Price of silver Jewell
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
- He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.
- He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps together:

16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Total cost of classes = $60
Number of classes = 10

Cost per class = Total cost of classes / Number of classes
Cost per class = $60 / 10
Cost per class = $6

Since Manny's parents will not sign him up again if the classes cost more than $10 per class, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can attend at $6 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's assume Manny attends x classes at $6 per class and y classes at $10 per class. The total cost of classes should be equal to $60.

6x + 10y = 60

Since Manny can't attend a fraction of a class, we need to find the maximum whole number of classes he can attend at $6 per class. 

We can start by trying different values of x and see which one satisfies the equation.

If x = 9, then 6(9) + 10y = 54 + 10y
54 + 10y = 60
10y = 6
y = 0.6 (not a whole number)

If x = 8, then 6(8) + 10y = 48 + 10y
48 + 10y = 60
10y = 12
y = 1.2 (not a whole number)

If x = 7, then 6(7) + 10y = 42 + 10y
42 + 10y = 60
10y = 18
y = 1.8 (not a whole number)

If x = 6, then 6(6) + 10y = 36 + 10y
36 + 10y = 60
10y = 24
y = 2.4 (not a whole number)

If x = 5, then 6(5) + 10y = 30 + 10y
30 + 10y = 60
10y = 30
y = 3

So, Manny can attend 5 classes at $6 per class and 5 classes at $10 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

"Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and she works all 7 days of the week, her total weekly production is 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, she processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day. Her total weekly production is 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The combined total weekly production for the two is 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

"To find the cost of 5 apples, we need to first find the cost of one apple. 

Cost of 4 apples = $5.20
Cost of 1 apple = $5.20 / 4 = $1.30

Now, we can find the cost of 5 apples.
Cost of 5 apples = $1.30 * 5 = $6.50

To find the cost of 5 oranges, we need to first find the cost of one orange.

Cost of 3 oranges = $3.30
Cost of 1 orange = $3.30 / 3 = $1.10

Now, we can find the cost of 5 oranges.
Cost of 5 oranges = $1.10 * 5 = $5.50

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges.
Total cost = Cost of 5 apples + Cost of 5 oranges
Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50
Total cost = $12.00

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Next, let's calculate the bonus:
Bonus = half a month's salary = $20,000 / 2 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly income:
Total monthly income = new monthly salary + bonus = $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as 4S + 2G = 70.

Since each sheep has 1 head and each goose has 1 head, the total number of heads can be represented as S + G = 20.

We can solve the second equation for G: G = 20 - S.

Substituting G = 20 - S into the first equation, we get 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

Combining like terms, we get 2S + 40 = 70.

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2S = 30.

"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:

Janey's books = 2x + 3

We are given that Janey has 21 books. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To find the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we need to find the difference between the target height and the current height:

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. 
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs 8 more toys.
   Total toys needed so far: 4 (initial toys) + 8 (additional toys) = 12 toys
3. When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Since there were 8 dogs initially, there are now 8 * 2 = 16 more dogs.
   Total dogs now: 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (initial additional dogs) + 16 (new dogs) = 28 dogs
   Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 28 more toys.
   Total toys needed so far: 12 (initial toys) + 28 (additional toys) = 40 toys
4. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys.
   Total toys needed: 40 (total toys needed so far) - 3 (toys no longer needed) = 37 toys

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to subtract the added length from the final length and then divide by 1.5 (since 50% is the same as 0.5, and 1 + 0.5 = 1.5).

Let's denote the original length as x.

The final length is the original length plus 50% of the original length, which is 1.5x, plus 20cm.

We know the final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. 

Since there are two twins and one triplet, the total age is 2T + t = 44. 

We also know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so T = t + 7.

Substituting T = t + 7 into the first equation, we get 2(t + 7) + t = 44.

Expanding the equation, we get 2t + 14 + t = 44.

Combining like terms, we get 3t + 14 = 44.

Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get 3t = 30.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get t = 10.

Now that we know the age of the triplet, we can find the age of the older twin. Since T = t + 7, T = 10 + 7 = 17.

"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year) and 10 (the number of years).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 coins more than Rong. 
So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year: 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year: 28 * 12 = 336 coins

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, but we don't know the total bill yet. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage used for industrial purposes and then subtract it from the total percentage used by the city.

The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. 

So, the percentage used for industrial purposes is 40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%.

Now, to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city: 40% - 32% = 8%.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to first find the total amount she charges for 1 week and then multiply it by 2.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Alex charges $12 per day, the total amount she charges for 1 week is:
7 days * $12/day = $84

Now, we multiply this amount by 2 to find the total amount she charges for 2 weeks:
$84 * 2 = $168

The final answer is: $168"
"To find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each type of ice cream and then multiply it by the number of hours.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. 
So, the production rate of chocolate ice cream is 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. 
So, the production rate of vanilla ice cream is 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

In 48 hours, the total production of chocolate ice cream would be 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts.
In 48 hours, the total production of vanilla ice cream would be 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts.

The total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours would be 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts.

The final answer is: 3000"
"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the discount.

Cost of croissants: 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
Cost of cinnamon rolls: 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
Cost of mini quiches: 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
Cost of blueberry muffins: 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Total cost before discount: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Discount: 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Total bill after discount: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

"To find out how many scoops Erin can buy, we need to first calculate the total cost of the ice cream. Since each scoop costs $1.50, and Erin has $6.00, we can divide the amount of money she has by the cost of each scoop.

$6.00 / $1.50 = 4

This means Erin can buy 4 scoops of ice cream. However, the deal is buy 2 scoops get 1 free, so Erin can get 3 scoops for the price of 2. 

To take advantage of the deal, Erin should buy 2 scoops and get 1 free, which is a total of 3 scoops.

"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of candies they eat in two weeks and subtract that from their initial amount.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total area that Mr. Boarden needs to cover, we need to calculate two thirds of 36 sq ft. 

Two thirds of 36 sq ft is calculated as: (2/3) * 36 = 24 sq ft.

"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the cost of picking the blueberries and the cost of buying them at the store, then subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store.

Cost of picking blueberries: $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 (per pound) * 30 (pounds) = $20 + $45 = $65

Cost of buying blueberries at the store: $2.5 (per pound) * 30 (pounds) = $75

Now, let's calculate the savings: $75 (cost at the store) - $65 (cost of picking) = $10

The final answer is: $10"
"To find the new price of each computer, we need to calculate 10% of the original price and add it to the original price.

Original price per computer = $700
Increase in price = 10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70
New price per computer = Original price + Increase in price = $700 + $70 = $770

Now, we can find the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices.

Total number of computers = 500
Total amount paid = New price per computer * Total number of computers
Total amount paid = $770 * 500
Total amount paid = $385,000

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the number of taps for both scenarios (with arms down and with arms up) and add them together.

With arms down, Helga taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. So, the total number of taps per minute is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute. Since she dances with her arms down for 3 minutes, the total number of taps is 550 * 3 = 1650.

With arms up, Helga taps her right foot at 200 taps per minute and her left foot at 200 taps per minute. So, the total number of taps per minute is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute. Since she dances with her arms up for 2 minutes, the total number of taps is 400 * 2 = 800.

Now, we add the total number of taps from both scenarios: 1650 + 800 = 2450.

"To find the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends, we first need to find the total number of slices they ate. Since there are 5 people in total, and 2 friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

2/3 * 5 pizzas * 12 slices per pizza = 2/3 * 60 = 40 slices

However, since Bryce also ate 2/3 of his pizza, we need to add 2/3 of 1 pizza to the total. 

2/3 * 12 slices = 8 slices

So, the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends is 40 + 8 = 48 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

3/4 * 2 pizzas * 12 slices per pizza = 3/4 * 24 = 18 slices

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by all friends:

48 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (two remaining friends) = 66 slices

"To find the time the dog takes to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time the cat takes. 

The cat takes 30 minutes to eat the sausages. 
2/3 of 30 minutes is (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

So, the dog takes 20 minutes to eat the sausages.

To find the average time, we need to add the time taken by the cat and the dog and divide by 2.

Average time = (30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so 8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding 4 inches to that gives us 96 + 4 = 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. Then, the length of one of Topher's shoes can be represented as 9x + 10.

We know that 9x + 10 = 100. To find 'x', we need to isolate it. Subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 9x = 100 - 10, which gives us 9x = 90.

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 9 to find 'x': x = 90 / 9, which gives us x = 10.

"To find the total number of blue spools, we need to add the light blue and dark blue spools together. 

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Next, we need to find the total number of spools. 

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total blue spools by the total spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 and subtract that from the total number of people.

At 8:00, 2/5 of 5000 people had voted by midday. 
2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by midday.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
The number of people remaining after midday is 5000 - 2000 = 3000.
2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people voted by 16:00.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is the total number of people minus the number of people who voted by 16:00.
5000 - (2000 + 2000) = 5000 - 4000 = 1000

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

1. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
   90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons.

2. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
   50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

3. She trades the rest of her large stickers (40 - 20 = 20) for small buttons. 
   Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has:
- Small buttons: 27 (from small stickers) + 60 (from large stickers) = 87 small buttons
- Large buttons: 20

Total buttons = 87 (small buttons) + 20 (large buttons) = 107 buttons

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as x. Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second, the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first, so it needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. We can write an equation to represent this:

x + (x/2) + x = 250

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms:

5x = 500

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

Time to drive to the museum: 
Distance to the museum = 150 miles
Speed = 75 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 150 / 75 = 2 hours

Time to drive back home:
Since the distance is the same, the time will also be the same: 2 hours

Total time driving = 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours

Time spent at the museum = 6 hours

Total time Jack is gone from home = Total time driving + Time spent at the museum = 4 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of wheels needed for the toys, we need to calculate the number of wheels for the cars and the number of wheels for the motorcycles separately and then add them together.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each car, and he has 57 cars. So, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is 4 * 57 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle, and he has 73 motorcycles. So, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is 2 * 73 = 146.

Now, we add the total number of wheels needed for the cars and the motorcycles: 228 + 146 = 374.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels in it. To find the number of wheels left, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the total number of wheels in the box: 650 - 374 = 276.

The final answer is: 276"
"To find the discount amount, multiply the price of the laptop by the discount percentage (20% or 0.20). 

Discount amount = $1000 * 0.20 = $200

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price you have to pay.

Final price = $1000 - $200 = $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the series movies, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies.

First, let's find the number of series movies. A third of the movies are in series, so the number of series movies is 600 / 3 = 200.

The cost of the series movies is 200 * $6 = $1200.

Next, let's find the number of remaining movies. The number of remaining movies is 600 - 200 = 400.

40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so the number of older movies is 400 * 0.4 = 160.

The cost of the older movies is 160 * $5 = $800.

The number of normal movies is 400 - 160 = 240.

The cost of the normal movies is 240 * $10 = $2400.

The total cost is $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400.

The final answer is: $4400"

Cost of apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Total cost = $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To find the distance, we first need to find the speed at which they hiked. 

The Llesis family drove at an average of 50 miles per hour. Half of their speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. They hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their speed, so their hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

They hiked for 1.5 hours, so the distance they hiked is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

They drove for 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours. The distance they drove is 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

The total distance to their vacation spot is 30 + 225 = 255 miles.

The final answer is: 255"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma.

Let's assume Emma's score is x. 

Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's enemy score is x + 8 * 10 = 10x + 80.
Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, Ava's berry score is x + 3 * 5 = 5x + 15.
Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, Ava's timer score is (60 - 4) - (60 - x) = x - 4.

The total score for Emma is x + 0 (since she doesn't collect any extra berries or jump on any extra enemies) + (60 - x) = 60.
The total score for Ava is (10x + 80) + (5x + 15) + (x - 4) = 16x + 91.

The difference between their scores is (16x + 91) - 60 = 16x + 31.

However, we don't know the value of x. To find the difference, we need to know the value of x. But since we are asked for the difference in scores, we can express it in terms of x."
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to find the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. 

Two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, so the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract this amount from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. 

Total cost of all four pizzas = 64 dollars
Total cost of the two known pizzas = 60 dollars
Total cost of the other two pizzas = 64 - 60 = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

Cost of each of the other two pizzas = 4 / 2 = 2 dollars

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

The total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is the sum of the times they ride on usual days and the times they ride on the extra days, which is 15 + 12 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as W and the number of orange fish Bob bought as O. 

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had 3 + O orange fish and 4 + W white fish. 

Since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation: 3 + O = 2(4 + W).

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so O + W = 17.

Now we have two equations:

1) 3 + O = 2(4 + W)
2) O + W = 17

From equation 2, we can express O as 17 - W.

Substituting O = 17 - W into equation 1, we get:
3 + (17 - W) = 2(4 + W)

Expanding the equation, we get:
3 + 17 - W = 8 + 2W

Combine like terms:
20 - W = 8 + 2W

Add W to both sides:
20 = 8 + 3W

Subtract 8 from both sides:
12 = 3W

Divide both sides by 3:
4 = W

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total miles driven per week and then multiply it by the fuel efficiency and the price of gas.

The one-way distance between home and office is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 5 * 2 = 10 miles per day. Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, the total miles driven per week is 10 * 5 = 50 miles.

The fuel efficiency of Andy's car is 10 MPG, so the amount of gas consumed per week is 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons.

The price of gas is $3 per gallon, so the total cost per week is 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the amount she spent from the quarters and the twenties separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent from the quarters. Since she had 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount she spent from the quarters is:

140 quarters * $0.25 = $35

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent from the twenties. She had 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. 3/5 of 10 is 6, so she spent 6 twenties. Each twenty is worth $20, so the total amount she spent from the twenties is:

6 twenties * $20 = $120

Now, let's add the amount she spent from the quarters and the twenties to find the total amount she paid for lunch:

$35 (quarters) + $120 (twenties) = $155

The final answer is: $155"

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to find the total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED TVs, we subtract the total number of smart and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature at night. 

Given that it was 45 degrees during the day and it's 33 degrees colder at night, we can calculate the temperature at night as follows:
Temperature at night = Temperature during the day - 33 degrees
Temperature at night = 45 - 33
Temperature at night = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house to at least 32 degrees to prevent the pipes from freezing.

To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we need to calculate the difference between the temperature at night and the temperature at which the pipes won't freeze:
Difference = Temperature at which pipes won't freeze - Temperature at night
Difference = 32 - 12
Difference = 20 degrees

Since each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, we can calculate the number of logs needed as follows:
Number of logs = Difference / 5
Number of logs = 20 / 5
Number of logs = 4

"To find the total number of seashells, we first need to find the number of groups and then the number of groups that brought seashells. 

First, we find the number of groups: 
Number of people = 90
Number of people per group = 9
Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Next, we find the number of groups that brought seashells: 
Fraction of groups that brought seashells = 3/5
Number of groups that brought seashells = Number of groups * Fraction of groups that brought seashells
Number of groups that brought seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought seashells = 6

Now, we find the total number of seashells: 
Number of seashells per group = 2
Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total number of seashells = 6 * 2
Total number of seashells = 12

Initially, there were 172 people on the train.

At the first stop, 47 people got off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
172 - 47 = 125

Then, 13 people got on, so we add 13 to 125:
125 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people got off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
138 - 38 = 100

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

Number of stuffed puppies = 3
Number of stuffed koalas = 5
Number of stuffed zebras = 2
Number of stuffed frogs = 4

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Since Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals.

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy, so we will round down to the nearest whole number because you can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal.

Number of stuffed goats to buy = 4

However, since 4.2 is 4.2% of 14, and 4 is 28.6% of 14, we need to find the number of stuffed goats that will make 30% of 14. We can do this by finding the difference between 30% and 28.6% of 14, and then adding that to 4.

30% of 14 = 4.2
28.6% of 14 = 4
Difference = 4.2 - 4 = 0.2

Since 0.2 is 1.4% of 14, we need to find the number of stuffed goats that is 1.4% of 14.

1.4% of 14 = 0.014 * 14 = 0.196

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy, so we will round down to the nearest whole number because you can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal.

Number of stuffed goats to buy = 0

However, since 0.196 is 1.4% of 14, and 0 is 0% of 14, we need to find the number of stuffed goats that will make 1.4% of 14. We can do this by finding the difference between 1.4% and 0% of 14, and then adding that to 0.

1.4% of 14 = 0.196
0% of 14 = 0
Difference = 0.196 - 0 = 0.196

Since 0.196 is 1.4% of 14, we need to find the number of stuffed goats that is 1.4% of 14.

0.196 is 1.4% of 14, so we can set up the equation 0.014x = 0.196, where x is the number of stuffed goats.

0.014x = 0.196
x = 0.196 / 0.014
x = 14

However, this is the total number of stuffed animals, not the number of stuffed goats. We need to find the number of stuffed goats that will make 30% of 14. We can do this by finding the difference between 30% and 14% of 14, and then adding that to 0.

30% of 14 = 4.2
14% of 14 = 1.96
Difference = 4.2 - 1.96 = 2.24

Since 2.24 is 16% of 14, we need to find the number of stuffed goats that is 16% of 14.

16% of 14 = 0.16 * 14 = 2.24

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we need to round down to the nearest whole number because you can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340, and the total number of third-graders is 500. 
The number of fourth-graders who passed is 40, and the total number of fourth-graders is 100.

The pass rate for the fifth graders is twice the pass rate of the fourth graders. Since 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed, the pass rate for the fourth graders is 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%. 
The pass rate for the fifth graders is 2 * 0.4 = 0.8 or 80%. 
The number of fifth-graders who passed is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed: 
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 320 (fifth-graders) = 700.

The total number of students in the school is 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students: 
700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to find out how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and each bag holds 72 chips, we need to find out how many chips Milo has in total. 

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, so he has 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Since it takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12 to find out how many square inches Milo can make: 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, and he can make 12 square inches of mosaic, we need to find out how long the mosaic will be. 

To do this, we divide the total square inches by the height of the mosaic: 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

"To find the total amount of tea left, we need to calculate the total amount of tea drank by the students. 

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea drank is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, the total amount of tea left is 10 quarts. To find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to add the amount drank to the amount left. 

Total tea at the beginning = 38 (drank) + 10 (left) = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4: 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

Dale initially ordered 100 candies and then sold 150. So, he had 100 - 150 = -50 candies left. However, this is not possible since you can't have a negative number of candies. This means he must have ordered more candies to sell. 

Dale then ordered 100 more candies. So, he now has 100 (initial candies) + 100 (additional candies) = 200 candies in total.

Since he has 200 candies and he wants to sell all of them, and he has already sold 150, he needs to sell 200 - 150 = 50 more candies.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the number of students at the end of May, we need to calculate the number of times the initial number of students doubles from January to May.

January: 10 students
February: 10 * 2 = 20 students
March: 20 * 2 = 40 students
April: 40 * 2 = 80 students
May: 80 * 2 = 160 students

The number of students at the end of May is 160. To find the number of additional students, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May.

Additional students = 160 - 10 = 150

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25).

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (5 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:
- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used and the ones dropped from the total number of marshmallows in the bag.

Total marshmallows in the bag = 35
Marshmallows used by John = 9
Marshmallows used by DeSean = 9
Total marshmallows used = 9 + 9 = 18
Marshmallows dropped = 3
Total marshmallows used and dropped = 18 + 3 = 21

Now, let's subtract the total marshmallows used and dropped from the total number of marshmallows in the bag:
Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14

Since there are 14 marshmallows left, and there are 2 kids, we can divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many each kid can have:
14 / 2 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the total time played by each person and then multiply it by the cost per minute. 

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. 
Two of his friends can play for half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. 
One of his friends can play for 1.5 times as long, so they can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter.

The total time played is 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Jack's time: 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters
Two friends' time: 240 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters * 2 = 48 quarters
Better friend's time: 240 minutes / 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters

Total quarters used = 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 * 0.25 = $17.

The final answer is: $17"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces.
- The amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance.
- The amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar.
- The amount of oil is twice as much as the amount of salt.
- The amount of salt is twice as much as the amount of citrus zest.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as x. Then the amount of fragrance is also x. The amount of salt is 2x, and the amount of sugar is also 2x. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so it is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total amount of the mixture is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: x (citrus zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces.

Combine like terms: 8x = 10.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 10 / 8 = 1.25.

Now that we know x, we can find the amount of oil: 4x = 4 * 1.25 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

Cost of goats: 3 goats * $500 each = 3 * 500 = $1500
Cost of cows: 2 cows * $1500 each = 2 * 1500 = $3000

Total cost: $1500 (goats) + $3000 (cows) = $4500

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed: 63
Cupcakes already have: 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Now, subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs:
63 - 48 = 15

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

15"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cars Joe has initially, then calculate the number of cars he sells and gives away, and finally subtract that from the initial number of cars he had.

Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

He gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, which is 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

So, Joe gives away a total of 8 (sold) + 16 (given away) = 24 cars.

To find out how many cars Joe remains with, we subtract the number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine how much money the students raised in total. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the students raised $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we know that there are 20 students and they all raised the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the number of students: $125,000 / 20 = $6,250.

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 
On the second day, she walked half as many hours as the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes
4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

Total time = 480 minutes + 240 minutes = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first find the total number of cars in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break.

Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 of the cars had left. So, the number of cars that left is 1/2 * 70 = 35.

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot is 70 - 35 = 35.

However, the question asks for the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break. This would be the number of cars that were already present in the parking lot (70) plus the number of cars that arrived during the lunch break. Since 1/2 of the cars had left, 1/2 of the cars that were present initially (50) had left, and 1/2 of the 20 cars that arrived during the first break had also left. 

1/2 of 50 is 25, and 1/2 of 20 is 10. So, 25 + 10 = 35 cars had left. This means 35 cars arrived during the lunch break.

The total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 70 (already present) + 35 (arrived during lunch break) = 105.

The final answer is: 105"
"To find out how much John makes in a day, we need to multiply the number of cycles he does in a day by the number of tasks in each cycle and the pay per task. 

Number of cycles per day: 30
Number of tasks per cycle: 5
Pay per task: $1.20

Daily earnings = Number of cycles per day * Number of tasks per cycle * Pay per task
Daily earnings = 30 * 5 * $1.20
Daily earnings = 180 * $1.20
Daily earnings = $216

To find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7.

Weekly earnings = Daily earnings * 7
Weekly earnings = $216 * 7
Weekly earnings = $1512

The final answer is: $1512"
"To find the total points Sasha scored, we need to calculate her points in both games. 

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 
In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. 
So, in the second game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.

The total points Sasha scored during both games is 14 + 4 = 18."
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, multiply the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and add them together.

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 2 times the number of green eggs, so 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs
- Pink eggs: 1 fewer than blue eggs, so 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs
- Yellow eggs: 1/3 the number of pink eggs, so 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

The cost of shipping is calculated as follows:
- Cost per pound: $0.35
- Weight of the book: 4 pounds
- Cost per mile: $0.08
- Distance: 20 miles
- Total cost of shipping = (cost per pound * weight) + (cost per mile * distance)

- Refund amount = purchase price - shipping cost
- Refund amount = 32 - 3
- Refund amount = 29

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:
- Total cost of shipping: $3.00
- Refund amount: $29
- Amount lost = total cost of shipping - refund amount
- Amount lost = 3.00 - 29

"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Mulan starts with $40.
2. Her father gave her $100, so she now has $40 + $100 = $140.
3. She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of jeans is 2 * $30 = $60.
4. She also buys a bag for $20.
5. The total amount she spent is $60 + $20 = $80.
6. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the total amount she had: $140 - $80 = $60.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars.
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week:

- Time spent recording videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes
- Time spent writing songs: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes

Total time spent on TikTok in a week: 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4:
282 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1128 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
1128 minutes / 60 = 18.8 hours

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. Angela has additional items to be installed: 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. 

First, let's calculate the number of additional items: 
- Mirrors: 6 (additional) + 4 (initial) = 10
- Chandeliers: 2 (additional) + 1 (initial) = 3
- Pictures: 20 (additional) + 10 (initial) = 30

Now, let's calculate the cost of the additional items:
- Mirrors: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00
- Chandeliers: 3 * $15.00 = $45.00
- Pictures: 30 * $15.00 = $450.00

The total cost of the additional items is $150.00 + $45.00 + $450.00 = $645.00

Now, let's add the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items:
$129.00 (initial installation) + $645.00 (additional items) = $774.00

The final answer is: $774.00"
"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first determine how much money Anthony has. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $20.00 + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $30.00

Now that we know Anthony's savings, we can calculate Roy's savings. Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we can calculate Roy's savings as follows:

Let's first find 40% of Anthony's savings:
40% of $30.00 = 0.4 * $30.00 = $12.00

Now, we add this amount to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings:
Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% of Anthony's savings
Roy's savings = $30.00 + $12.00
Roy's savings = $42.00

So, Roy has saved $42.00.

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to find out how high Saskay, Kagiyami, and Naruto can lift a mountain in relation to Pompei.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches.
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. 
480 / 12 = 40 feet.

- The original price of the laptop is $600.
- The price is reduced by $200 when trading in the old laptop, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
- Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
- Her mom gives her $80.
- Erika now only needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to add the money she has from her job and the money her mom gave her, and then subtract the amount she still needs from the new price of the laptop.

First, let's add the money from her job and her mom: $150 + $80 = $230.

Now, let's subtract the amount she still needs from the new price of the laptop: $400 - $50 = $350.

Since Erika has $350 and she has $230 from her job and her mom, we need to find out how much she had in her purse initially. To do this, we subtract $230 from $350: $350 - $230 = $120.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of each used part and subtract it from the original length of the glue stick.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the used part is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6. The length of the used part is 5/6 * 12 = 10 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the used part is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. The length of the used part is 1/3 * 12 = 4 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the used part is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. The length of the used part is 1/2 * 12 = 6 millimeters.

The total length of the used parts is 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks is 3 * 12 = 36 millimeters.

"To find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs, we first need to determine the total number of glue sticks required. Since each student needs 2 glue sticks and there are 27 students, the total number of glue sticks needed is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by 8 to find out how many packs are needed. However, since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and expects to have some extra glue sticks left over, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

54 / 8 = 6.75

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to calculate the amount of water on the first day, the second day, and the third day, then add them together.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water doubles, so it is 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water increases by 6000 gallons, so it is 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: 24000"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. 

Day 1: 10 people are initially infected. Each of them infects 6 others, so the total number of people infected on Day 1 is 10 + (10 * 6) = 10 + 60 = 70.

Day 2: The 70 people from Day 1 infect 6 others each, so the total number of people infected on Day 2 is 70 + (70 * 6) = 70 + 420 = 490.

Day 3: The 490 people from Day 2 infect 6 others each, so the total number of people infected on Day 3 is 490 + (490 * 6) = 490 + 2940 = 3430.

"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to first calculate the total number of oranges given to her children. 

She gave her 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so 3 x 2 = 6 oranges. 
She gave her only son 3 oranges. 
So, the total number of oranges given to her children is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges initially. 
To find out how many oranges she remained with, we subtract the total number of oranges given to her children from the initial number of oranges. 
12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each person is:
- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices sold and then multiply it by the price per slice.

Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, she baked 2 * 5 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * $0.50 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to find the number of silver coins first. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and Gretchen has 70 gold coins, we can set up an equation to find the number of silver coins:

Let x be the number of silver coins.
Then, x + 30 = 70 (since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins)

To solve for x, we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:
x = 70 - 30
x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

Now, to find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins:
Total coins = 70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins)
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos eaten by the students and Mr. George. 

There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos eaten by the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George ate 20 burritos. 

The total number of burritos eaten is 500 (by students) + 20 (by Mr. George) = 520.

The total number of burritos ordered was 600. 

The total number of leftover burritos is 600 (total ordered) - 520 (total eaten) = 80.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

The total number of red, green, and blue cars is 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We know that S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
We also know that A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get S = (F - 12) + 25
S = F + 13

We also know that S + A + F = 85 (Together, they have 85 books)

Substituting the first equation into this, we get (F + 13) + A + F = 85
Combine like terms: 2F + A + 13 = 85

Substituting the second equation into this, we get 2F + (F - 12) + 13 = 85
Combine like terms: 3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides: 3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3: F = 28

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. First, we need to find out how many pieces were left after the first two days. 
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces left.

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26. 
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up the total number of pieces he ate: 
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

"To find out how much money Isaias made from selling the chickens, we first need to find out how many chickens he sold. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens, we can calculate this as follows:

3/5 * 300 = (3 * 300) / 5
= 900 / 5
= 180

So, Isaias sold 180 chickens. 

Now, we know that he sold each chicken for $50. To find the total amount of money he made, we multiply the number of chickens sold by the price per chicken:

180 * $50 = $9000

Since Isaias made a profit of $2000, we need to subtract this from the total amount he made to find out how much he spent on buying the chickens:

$9000 - $2000 = $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000."

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

The cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10.
The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 * 2 * $10 = $120, since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.
The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 * ($4 / 2) = $14, since each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.

The total cost of all the items is $10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156.

Kelly's budget is $65, so she has $65 - $156 = -$91 left in her budget. However, since you cannot have a negative amount of money, this means Kelly has overspent her budget by $91.

The final answer is: $-91"
"Let's denote the runtime of Elaina's usual concert as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, its runtime is 2x. 

The final concert also includes a 15-minute encore, so the total runtime of the final concert is 2x + 15. We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. 

We can set up the equation: 2x + 15 = 65

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 
2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:
x = 50 / 2
x = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25/100) * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which is five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

The final answer is: 55"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Ellen eats 2 carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day.
- The salad costs $6.
- The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.
- The total cost of Ellen's daily goods is $11.

We know that the total cost is the sum of the cost of 2 carrots, the salad, and the yogurt. Let's represent the cost of one carrot as 'x'. Then, the cost of 2 carrots is 2x.

The total cost equation is: 2x + 6 (salad) + 3 (yogurt) = 11

Combine the constants: 2x + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides: 2x = 2

Divide both sides by 2: x = 1

The cost of one carrot is $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is x + 3x + 5x = 9x.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and she mowed his lawn x times, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x.

We know that the total amount she made from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns is $80. So, the amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 6x.

We are given that she made $6 from Joe, so x = 1. 

Now, we can find the amount she made from lemonade sales: 80 - 6(1) = 74.

The final answer is: $74"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to find Christian's weight first, then subtract 5 kg from it.

Martin's weight is 55 kg.
Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"To find the total amount John earns from renting his car, we need to calculate the total hours he rents his car and multiply it by his hourly rate.

He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so the total hours he rents his car is 10 * 3 = 30 hours.

His hourly rate is $25, so the total amount he earns is 30 * $25 = $750.

However, he has to pay $500 for his car payment. To find the profit, we subtract the car payment from the total amount he earns: $750 - $500 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Martha initially had some notebooks, but we don't know the exact number. However, we know that after buying 5 more, she had a total of 7 notebooks. This means she initially had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, and Martha initially had 2 notebooks, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. So, Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we first need to find the distance rowed by Anis. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. 

1/5 of 50 miles is 50 * 1/5 = 10 miles. 

So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

The total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis is 50 + 60 = 110 miles.

"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we first need to subtract the cookies that Susan's husband took from the total number of cookies. 

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by Susan's husband = 4
Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by Susan's husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews to find out how many each will get.

Number of nephews = 6
Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today.

So, Denise read a total of 10 + 18 = 28 pages, and Daniel read a total of 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the number of pages Daniel read from the number of pages Denise read: 28 - 13 = 15.

"To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we first need to determine how many bowls of soup are left after dinner. 

Since there are 4 adults and 2 children, a total of 6 people will eat dinner. Each person eats one bowl, so 6 bowls will be used for dinner. 

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, which means it can fill 4 + 4 = 8 bowls in total. 

Since 6 bowls are used for dinner, there are 8 - 6 = 2 bowls left. 

The children will share these 2 bowls, and since there are 2 children, each child will get 2 / 2 = 1 bowl for lunch. 

The answer is 1."
"To find the total amount William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks: 
- Each small mask requires 2 yards of material.
- Jo needs to make 20 small masks.
- Total material required for small masks = 20 * 2 = 40 yards.

For large masks: 
- Each large mask requires 2.25 yards of material.
- Jo needs to make 8 large masks.
- Total material required for large masks = 8 * 2.25 = 18 yards.

Total material required = material for small masks + material for large masks = 40 + 18 = 58 yards.

"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to divide the total amount she spent by the total number of tickets she bought. 

First, let's find the total number of tickets she bought. Since she saw each movie 3 times, and there are 9 movies, the total number of tickets is 9 * 3 = 27.

Now, let's divide the total amount she spent ($216) by the total number of tickets (27) to find the average price per ticket.

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27

"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, so he has 24 - 10 = 14 hours left.

He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

He walks his dog for 1 hour.

Now, let's subtract the hours he spends working and walking his dog from the remaining hours: 14 - 8 - 1 = 5 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. 
2. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write the equation: (Duncan's age eight years ago) = 2 * (Adam's age four years ago)
   We know Duncan's current age is 60, so his age eight years ago was 60 - 8 = 52.
   Therefore, 52 = 2 * x
3. To find Adam's age four years ago, we need to solve for 'x'. Divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 52 / 2
   x = 26
4. Now that we know Adam's age four years ago, we can find his current age by adding 4 to 'x': Adam's current age = 26 + 4 = 30
5. To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age: Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8 = 38

"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes in that time and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

In an 8-hour workday, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, his total earnings for the day would be 320 * $0.20 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku and then divide it by the time it takes to drink one bottle of water.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so an extreme sudoku takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to convert the time from minutes to half hours. 180 minutes is equal to 180 / 30 = 6 half hours.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, he drinks 6 bottles of water in 6 half hours.

"Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as y. Since there are 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40. 

The total number of bologna pieces thrown at yellow balloons is 3y. The total number of bologna pieces thrown at all balloons is 58. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 40 + 3y = 58.

To solve for y, we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation: 3y = 58 - 40, 3y = 18. 

Now, we divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find y: y = 18 / 3, y = 6.

"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to first find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes the sloth 4 hours to make a round trip, in 8 hours, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips.

Since he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and he can make 2 trips, he needs to collect 24 / 2 = 12 berries per trip.

"To find the amount of water in the tank after 6 days, we need to first find the initial amount of water in the tank. Since Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, the initial amount of water in the tank is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Next, we need to find the total amount of water used from the tank in 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so in 6 days, the total amount of water used is 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank: 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 
Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories. 
Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories from both types of pastries are 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and John's age as J. 

We are given that Pp = J + 10. 
We are also given that P = Pp + J. 
We are also given that P + Pp + J = 100.

Substituting Pp = J + 10 into the equation P = Pp + J, we get P = (J + 10) + J, which simplifies to P = 2J + 10.

Substituting P = 2J + 10 and Pp = J + 10 into the equation P + Pp + J = 100, we get (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100.

Simplifying the equation, we get 4J + 20 = 100.

Subtracting 20 from both sides, we get 4J = 80.

Dividing both sides by 4, we get J = 20.

Now that we know J = 20, we can find Pp = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.

Finally, we can find P = Pp + J = 30 + 20 = 50.

"To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then multiply that by the price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine:

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay with the two options and then find the difference.

Option 1: 24-hour stay - 1600 pesos
Option 2: 12-hour stay (1000 pesos) + additional hours

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is 17 hours later. Since he already paid for the 12-hour stay, he needs to pay for the additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5).

Additional hours: 5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

Total cost for Option 2: 1000 pesos (12-hour stay) + 350 pesos (additional hours) = 1350 pesos

Now, let's find the difference between the two options:
Difference = Option 1 - Option 2 = 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos

Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing the option of adding 70 pesos for every additional hour."
"To find out how much hay each sheep needs, we need to calculate twice the amount each goat needs and then subtract 3 pounds. 

Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. 
Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than that, so 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately. 

15 goats need 15 * 5 = 75 pounds of hay.
12 sheep need 12 * 7 = 84 pounds of hay.

To find the total amount of hay needed, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

"To find out how much money John has left after buying pencils, we need to subtract the cost of the pencils from his total earnings. 

John's total earnings = 50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars
Cost of pencils = 5 * 10 dollars = 50 dollars
Money left after buying pencils = 300 dollars - 50 dollars = 250 dollars

Now, let's subtract the cost of gas from the money left after buying pencils.
Money left after buying gas = 250 dollars - 50 dollars = 200 dollars

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from the money left after buying gas.
Money left after depositing in the bank = 200 dollars - 100 dollars = 100 dollars

Now, let's find out how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money.
Number of pens = Money left after depositing in the bank / 25 dollars

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we need to calculate the original price and then subtract the discount. 

Original price of 10 CDs = 10 * $15 = $150
Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60
Price after discount = $150 - $60 = $90

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each, so he made a total of 5 * $40 = $200 from selling them.

However, he spent $90 on the CDs and made $200 from selling 5 of them. To find out how much money he was out, we need to subtract the amount he made from the amount he spent on the CDs he kept. 

Amount of CDs he kept = 10 - 5 = 5

"To find the time it took James to swim 60% of the distance, we first need to find 60% of 20 miles. 

60% of 20 miles = 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time it took him to swim 12 miles is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. James swims the remaining distance at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

The total time it took James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time it took to swim the remaining distance:

Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D. 

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. 

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can set A + 20 = D + 10. 

We also know that B + A + D = 45. 

We can substitute B = A + 20 into the equation B + A + D = 45 to get (A + 20) + A + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2A + D + 20 = 45. 

We can also substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B + A + D = 45 to get (D + 10) + A + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2D + A + 10 = 45. 

Now we have two equations: 2A + D + 20 = 45 and 2D + A + 10 = 45. 

We can subtract the second equation from the first to get (2A + D + 20) - (2D + A + 10) = 45 - 45. 

This simplifies to A - D + 10 = 0. 

We can subtract 10 from both sides to get A - D = -10. 

We can add D to both sides to get A = D - 10. 

Now we can substitute A = D - 10 into the equation B = A + 20 to get B = (D - 10) + 20. 

This simplifies to B = D + 10. 

We know that B = D + 10 and B = A + 20. 

We can substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B = A + 20 to get D + 10 = A + 20. 

We can subtract 10 from both sides to get D = A + 10. 

Now we have A = D - 10 and D = A + 10. 

We can substitute D = A + 10 into the equation A = D - 10 to get A = (A + 10) - 10. 

This simplifies to A = A. 

We can substitute D = A + 10 into the equation A = D - 10 to get A = (A + 10) - 10. 

This simplifies to A = A. 

We can substitute A = D - 10 into the equation 2A + D + 20 = 45 to get 2(D - 10) + D + 20 = 45. 

This simplifies to 3D - 20 + 20 = 45. 

This simplifies to 3D = 45. 

We can divide both sides by 3 to get D = 15. 

Now that we know D = 15, we can substitute D = 15 into the equation A = D - 10 to get A = 15 - 10. 

This simplifies to A = 5. 

Now that we know A = 5, we can substitute A = 5 into the equation B = A + 20 to get B = 5 + 20. 

This simplifies to B = 25. 

The points scored by Azibo is 5."

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total time she slept on her bed, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from her total sleep time: 480 - 23 = 457 minutes.

The final answer is: 457"
"To find the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially, we need to first find the number of measuring cups he has. Since he has two dozen cups, we multiply 2 by 12 to get the total number of cups.

2 * 12 = 24 cups

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we multiply the number of cups by 2/3 to get the number of spoons.

24 * (2/3) = 16 spoons

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with:

16 - 6 = 10 spoons

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the remaining spoons and the number of cups.

24 (cups) + 10 (spoons) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the number of occupied beds initially, we need to calculate 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital. 

1/5 of 1000 = 100

So, the hospital has 100 occupied beds initially.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, in 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted will be:

50 * 14 = 700

Now, the total number of occupied beds will be the initial occupied beds plus the new admissions:

100 + 700 = 800

The total capacity of the hospital is 1000, so the number of unoccupied beds will be:

1000 - 800 = 200

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to first find out how many emails are not work-related. 

Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 are work emails. So, the remainder is 16 - 7 = 9 emails.

Two-thirds of the remainder are to family, which is 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails.

The other emails are to her boyfriend, which is 1/3 of the remainder. So, 1/3 * 9 = 3 emails.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.
2. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya.
3. Aliya is 3 years old.

Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old, we can find Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3:
Shawna's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years

Now that we know Shawna's age, we can find her father's age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5:
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9 = 45 years

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from the number she reported.

Let's first find 20% of 48:
20% of 48 = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48 to find the actual number of people who attended the concert:
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

38.4"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Jason carried 2 balls.
- Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jeffrey carried half of what Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.
- Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them: 2 (Jason) + 1 (Jeffrey) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

The total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is equal to the total number of balls carried by the boys, which is 7."
"To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to first determine the total number of holes at the end of the third day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes the first day, 13 holes the second day, and 8 holes the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since there were 29 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got as x. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so we can set up the equation:

x = 70

Since Collins got x + 15 corn chips, we can set up the equation for the total number of corn chips as:

x + (x + 15) + x = total number of corn chips

Substituting x = 70 into the equation, we get:

70 + (70 + 15) + 70 = total number of corn chips
70 + 85 + 70 = total number of corn chips
225 = total number of corn chips

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, we find 50% of the cost of supplies: 50% of $400 = 0.5 * $400 = $200.

Then, we add this amount to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel: $400 + $200 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L. 

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so A + S + L = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so L = S + 5.

We also know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so S = 4A - 13.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one: A + (S + 5) + S = 339.

This simplifies to A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Now we can substitute the third equation into this one: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.

This simplifies to A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.

Combine like terms: 9A - 21 = 339.

Add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Divide by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to find half of the number of minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, half of that is 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.

To find the total minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and then add it to the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the southerly direction is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 10 = 300 miles

The bird then flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the northerly direction is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 2 = 36 miles

Since the bird is flying south again, we need to subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction from the distance traveled in the southerly direction to find the net distance traveled in the southerly direction:
Net distance = 300 - 36 = 264 miles

The bird then flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the additional distance traveled in the southerly direction is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 22 * 5 = 110 miles

The total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is the sum of the net distance traveled in the southerly direction and the additional distance traveled in the southerly direction:
Total distance = 264 + 110 = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to add the brownies she made, the ones she took home from the office, and the ones her friends brought. 

She made 1 dozen (12) brownies. 
She took home 1/2 dozen (6) brownies from the office. 
Her friends brought 4 dozen (48) brownies.

Total brownies = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66

Then, we need to subtract the brownies that were eaten during the party. 
1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.

Total brownies left = 66 - 18 = 48

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we need to multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form).

Nani's sister's age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together: Nani's age + brother's age + sister's age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first 2 phones and the remaining phones. 

The first 2 phones cost $600 each, so the total cost for the first 2 phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining phones are 2 (for the kids and the wife), and each of these phones is half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300.

The total cost for the remaining 2 phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

The total cost for all phones is $1200 (for the first 2 phones) + $600 (for the remaining 2 phones) = $1800.

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to find the number of players in Zeke's team and add it to the number of players in Carlton's team.

Carlton's team has 13 players. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. 

So, Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).

Given the length of the fence is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first determine how many oranges she had initially, then subtract the oranges she gave away and kept.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, each containing 20 oranges. So, the total number of oranges she bought is 12 * 20 = 240.

She gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each, which is 2 * 2 = 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 240 = 60 oranges.

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the oranges she gave away and kept from the total number of oranges: 240 - 80 - 60 = 100.

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, he still needs to earn $39 - $14 = $25.

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can find the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the amount he still needs to earn ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 / $5 = 5 hours.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Robert has 30 cherries.
- Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard.
- The total number of cherries is 60.

Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, we can represent Richard's cherries as 30 - 10 = 20.

Now, let's find out how many cherries Jerry has. We know that the total number of cherries is 60, and we already know that Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries in total. 

So, the number of cherries Jerry has is 60 - 50 = 10.

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. Robert has 30 cherries, and Jerry has 10 cherries. 

The difference between Robert's and Jerry's cherries is 30 - 10 = 20.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.
- On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so G = 10.
- On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so A = Sunday's apple pie - 4.
- On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so Sunday's gingerbread = G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.
- On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, we can find the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday. 
A = Sunday's apple pie - 4
A = 15 - 4
A = 11

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for Saturday and Sunday.

- Total earnings on Saturday = (G * 6) + (A * 15) = (10 * 6) + (11 * 15) = 60 + 165 = 225
- Total earnings on Sunday = (Sunday's gingerbread * 6) + (Sunday's apple pie * 15) = (15 * 6) + (15 * 15) = 90 + 225 = 315

Total earnings for two days = Total earnings on Saturday + Total earnings on Sunday = 225 + 315 = 540

"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use. 

She reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day. So, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day. 

Since she will be on vacation for 8 days, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day for 8 days, which is 4 * 8 = 32 times.

Each bottle of sunscreen is 8 ounces, and she uses 1 ounce each time. So, she will need 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.

To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total amount of sunscreen needed (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces). 

32 / 8 = 4

So, Pamela will need 4 bottles of sunscreen.

1. Emil is 19 years old now.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

From point 3, we can deduce that Emil's brother is currently half of Emil's age when Emil turns 24. Since Emil will be 24, his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

From point 2, we know that when Emil turns 24, his dad will be twice as old as Emil. So, his dad's age when Emil turns 24 will be 24 * 2 = 48 years.

Now, we need to find the current age of Emil's dad and brother. Emil's dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old (since Emil is 19 now and will be 24 in 5 years). Emil's brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to first convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches
111 feet = 111 * 12 = 1332 inches

Now, we need to find the total space taken up by the plants and the space between them. 

Let's assume the number of plants is 'n'. The total space taken up by the plants is 12n inches. The total space between the plants is 1.5 * (n - 1) feet, which is equal to 18 * (n - 1) inches.

The total length of the flower bed is 1332 inches. So, we can set up the equation:

12n + 18(n - 1) = 1332

Combine like terms:

12n + 18n - 18 = 1332
30n - 18 = 1332

Add 18 to both sides:

30n = 1350

Divide both sides by 30:

n = 45

So, Pat can fit 45 plants in her flower bed. However, she already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 45 - 17 = 28 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be:

28 * 6 = 168

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: peeling and cooking.

First, let's calculate how long it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we can divide 90 by 6 to get the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp.

90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide 90 by 30 to get the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp, then multiply by 10.

90 / 30 = 3
3 * 10 = 30 minutes

However, since peeling and cooking are done sequentially, we need to add the time it takes to peel and cook.

"To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to first find out how old Bill's dad was when Bill saw the comet for the second time. 

Since Bill saw the comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, let's call the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet ""x"". Then, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is 3x.

We know that 75 years passed between the two times Bill's dad saw the comet. So, the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet for the second time is x + 75.

Since Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is 3x, we can set up the equation: 3x = x + 75.

Now, let's solve for x:
3x - x = 75
2x = 75
x = 75 / 2
x = 37.5

Now that we know Bill's dad was 37.5 years old when he saw the comet, we can find out how old Bill was when his dad saw the comet. We know that Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, so the difference in their ages is 37.5 - 30 = 7.5 years.

Since Bill was 7.5 years younger than his dad when his dad saw the comet, we can find Bill's age by subtracting 7.5 from 30:
30 - 7.5 = 22.5

So, Bill was 22.5 years old when his dad saw the comet for the first time.

The final answer is: 22.5"

"To find the number of flights to France, we need to first find the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 flights.

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is (3/4) * 88 = 66. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/2) * (88 - 66) = (1/2) * 22 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, Adam had to contribute $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. The total age of the children is 20, and we know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro. 

The total age of the children can be expressed as: 
Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20
3 + 4 + Helene's age + W = 20

Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. 
Average age = (3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4
Helene's age = 2 * ((3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4)

We can simplify the equation by substituting Helene's age in terms of the average age:
Helene's age = 2 * ((3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4)
Helene's age = (2 * (7 + Helene's age + W)) / 4
4 * Helene's age = 2 * (7 + Helene's age + W)
4 * Helene's age = 14 + 2 * Helene's age + 2W
2 * Helene's age = 14 + 2W
Helene's age = 7 + W

Now we can substitute Helene's age in the equation for the total age of the children:
3 + 4 + (7 + W) + W = 20
12 + 2W = 20
2W = 8
W = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 

Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend gives him $200, but this is not included in the amount that the lawyer will donate. The lawyer will donate based on the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund.

So, the amount that the lawyer will donate is 3 times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, which is 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find the total number of cookies, we multiply the number of guests by the number of cookies each guest brought. 

Total cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

Since the bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church, we need to find 1/2 of 1500 cookies.

1/2 of 1500 cookies = 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got.

Number of people in the church = 750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's assume the total watermelon is divided into 12 slices (6 adults and 6 kids). 

Let's say each kid gets 1 slice. Since each adult gets twice as big a slice as each kid, each adult gets 2 slices. 

So, the total number of slices each adult gets is 2. 

The total number of slices is 12. 

The percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (2/12) * 100 = 16.67%."
"To find out how much time Doctor Jones will spend on rounds, we need to multiply the number of inpatients by the time spent per inpatient. 

9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total minutes to hours. 

180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on appointments. 

10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Converting the total minutes to hours:

300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

Now, let's add the time spent on rounds and appointments to the total time spent at the clinic.

9 hours (at the clinic) + 3 hours (on rounds) + 5 hours (on appointments) = 17 hours

Since Doctor Jones has 9 hours at the clinic, we need to subtract the total time spent from the total hours available.

9 hours - 17 hours = -8 hours

However, since we cannot have a negative number of hours, we need to recalculate the time spent on appointments in hours and then subtract it from the total hours available.

5 hours (on appointments) = 300 minutes (on appointments) / 60 = 5 hours

Now, let's recalculate the total time spent at the clinic in hours.

9 hours (at the clinic) + 3 hours (on rounds) + 5 hours (on appointments) = 17 hours

Since Doctor Jones has 9 hours at the clinic, we need to subtract the total time spent from the total hours available.

9 hours - 17 hours = -8 hours

However, since we cannot have a negative number of hours, we need to recalculate the time spent on rounds in hours and then subtract it from the total hours available.

3 hours (on rounds) = 180 minutes (on rounds) / 60 = 3 hours

Now, let's recalculate the total time spent at the clinic in hours.

9 hours (at the clinic) + 3 hours (on rounds) + 5 hours (on appointments) = 17 hours

Since Doctor Jones has 9 hours at the clinic, we need to subtract the total time spent from the total hours available.

9 hours - 17 hours = -8 hours

However, since we cannot have a negative number of hours, we need to recalculate the time spent on appointments in minutes and then subtract it from the total hours available.

5 hours (on appointments) = 300 minutes (on appointments)

Now, let's recalculate the total time spent at the clinic in minutes.

9 hours * 60 = 540 minutes (at the clinic)
180 minutes (on rounds) + 300 minutes (on appointments) = 480 minutes

Now, let's subtract the total time spent from the total minutes available.

540 minutes - 480 minutes = 60 minutes

Converting the remaining minutes to hours:

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:
180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Jordan needs 3 hours to make the cake. To be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm, she should start making the cake at 2:00 pm.

"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We are given that they sold 64 chocolate bars together. So, 8x = 64.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 8: 
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. So, the total number of sessions in a month is 3 sessions/day * 4 weeks = 12 sessions.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

The total cost per session is $40, and there are 12 sessions in a month. So, the total cost for the month is $40 * 12 = $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as 'x'. Since Peter has 4 boxes, the total number of chocolate bars he has is 4x. We are given that this total is 64, so we can write the equation:

4x = 64

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 64 / 4
x = 16

Now, let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as 'y'. Since Martha has 7 boxes, the total number of chocolate bars she has is 7y. We are given that this total is 56, so we can write the equation:

7y = 56

To find the value of 'y', we divide both sides of the equation by 7:

y = 56 / 7
y = 8

Now that we know the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes, we can find the difference:

Difference = x - y
= 16 - 8
= 8

"To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5. 

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is 4 * 12 = 48.

The total number of porcupines after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the number of babies born. 

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 48 = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed them to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need, we need to do that next.

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. To find the total cost, we need to multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon.

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

"To find the distance traveled by Matteo, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.

To find the distance traveled by Shandy, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.

To find the difference in distance traveled, we subtract the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we need to first find the number of male students and then subtract that from the total number of students.

1. Total students = 3000
2. Students over 16 years old = 3000 / 2 = 1500
3. Male students over 16 years old = 1500 / 4 = 375
4. Female students over 16 years old = 1500 - 375 = 1125
5. Students under 16 years old = 3000 / 2 = 1500
6. Male students under 16 years old = 1500 / 2 = 750
7. Female students under 16 years old = 1500 - 750 = 750

"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. To do this, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons. 

The amount of water remaining in the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x%.

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is x - 5 * 9 = x - 45%.

In the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining is (x - 45) - 3 * 7 = x - 45 - 21 = x - 66%.

We are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. We can set up the equation:

x - 66 = 28

To solve for x, we add 66 to both sides of the equation:

x = 28 + 66
x = 94

The charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%."
"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and her hourly tips are $15. So, her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Now, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of the car, which is 20% of $10,000. 

20% of $10,000 is 0.20 * $10,000 = $2000.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000. We can do this by dividing the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000).

$2000 / $1000 = 2

So, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate how much money he has left after purchasing the other fruits. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:
- 3 peaches at $.5 each: 3 * $.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $.5 each: 4 * $.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $.75 each: 5 * $.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he has already purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Since plums cost $.25 each, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy:
$0.75 / $.25 = 3

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. Since she kept 2 packs, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Next, we need to find out how many packs each friend received. Since there are 10 friends, we divide the total packs given away (13) by the number of friends (10). 

13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend.

Since each pack has 60 pieces, we multiply the number of packs each friend received by the number of pieces in each pack.

1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to first find the number of pictures in each album. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8 to find the number of pictures in each album.

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Since 3 albums were selfies only, the number of selfies is 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies.

The remaining albums are portraits, which is 8 albums - 3 albums = 5 albums. The number of portraits is 5 albums * 9 pictures per album = 45 portraits.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 'x' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'y'.
2. Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, we can write the equation: x = 2y.
3. The price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one, which is 3 * $4 = $12.
4. The total earnings from the sales are $120. We can write the equation: 4x + 12y = 120.
5. Since x = 2y, we can substitute this into the equation: 4(2y) + 12y = 120.
6. Simplifying the equation: 8y + 12y = 120.
7. Combining like terms: 20y = 120.
8. Solving for y: y = 120 / 20 = 6.
9. Since x = 2y, we can find x: x = 2 * 6 = 12.

"To find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe, we need to first find out how much he can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. So, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, we know that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. To find out how much 40 dwarves can mine in a day, we multiply 36 by 40: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds.

Since there are 30 days in a month, we multiply 1440 by 30 to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The ratio for the first package is 3/2, and for the second package is 6/4. We can simplify these ratios to 3/2 and 3/2, which means the price increases by a factor of 1.5 for each additional sandwich. 

Since the first package has 2 sandwiches and the second package has 4 sandwiches, the price of the second package is 1.5 times the price of the first package. 

The price of the first package is $3, so the price of the second package is 3 * 1.5 = $4.5. 

Now, we need to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches. Since the price increases by a factor of 1.5 for each additional sandwich, we can multiply the price of the second package by 1.5 twice to get the price of the package with 8 sandwiches. 

4.5 * 1.5 = 6.75 * 1.5 = 10.125

"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 * 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6. So, 6 yellow balloons were released, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's calculate the total number of balloons Sally had before adding the blue balloons: 15 red balloons + 7 green balloons + 6 yellow balloons = 28 balloons.

Adding the 6 blue balloons, Sally had 28 + 6 = 34 balloons in total.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). However, this scenario is dependent on the normal teacher not giving an extension, which has a 60% chance (100% - 40%). So, the probability of this scenario is 20% * 60% = 12%.

The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since the total probability must be 100%. This means we have overcounted the scenarios. 

The correct way to calculate this is to find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, which is 1 - (probability of not having to turn in his homework). 

The probability of not having to turn in his homework is the probability that the substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50%) or the normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40%).

"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we need to first find out how many seats are available for guests. 

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300
Total seats taken: 950 + 300 = 1250
Seats available for guests: 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Now, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive. 

Number of graduates: 950
Seats available for guests: 4750
Tickets per graduate: 4750 / 950 = 5

"To find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first find out how many medium-sized beans he can eat, and then find out how many small beans are equivalent to that amount.

Since it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, and he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can set up a proportion to find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. 

Let's say x is the number of small beans equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. Then, 3x = 150. 

To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 150 / 3 = 50.

So, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans. 

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses. 

Total earnings: 3 days * $15 per day = $45
Total expenses: 3 days * $3 per day = $9

Now, let's calculate her net earnings: 
Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = $45 - $9
Net earnings = $36

Next, we need to find out how many hours she worked in total: 
Total hours = 6 hours per day * 3 days
Total hours = 18 hours

Now, let's calculate her hourly pay after expenses:
Hourly pay after expenses = Net earnings / Total hours
Hourly pay after expenses = $36 / 18
Hourly pay after expenses = $2

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to find out how many bottles of soda he will place along the driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the number of bottles, we divide the total width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet = 8 bottles

Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next:

8 bottles * 5 seconds = 40 seconds

The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor starts with $50, so after buying the cheese, she will have $50 - $40 = $10 left.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and not working while in college. 

The total amount of loans he took is 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000.

The amount of money he lost by not working while in college is 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000.

So, the total amount of money he needs to earn is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After college, his income triples, so he now earns $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

To find out how long it will take him to earn $300,000 at this new income, we can divide the total amount by his new income: $300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to find the dimensions of the larger fabric pieces. 

The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. The fabric pieces need to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. 

So, the length of the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet and the width will be 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

Now, we can find the area of one fabric piece by multiplying the length and width: 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two fabric pieces, we multiply the area of one piece by 2: 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102. 
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 
5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209. 
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add up the number of letters delivered each day: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

"Let's denote the share of the first person as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

The share of the first person is $420."
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to convert 3/8ths to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

In the first set, Rory retrieved x + 4 balls. 
In the third set, he retrieved x / 2 balls.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is equal to 19. So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19.

To solve for x, we need to combine like terms and isolate x. Multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38.

Combine like terms: 2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38.

Combine like terms again: 5x + 8 = 38.

Subtract 8 from both sides: 5x = 30.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 6.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set: x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

Initial price of the car = $20,000
Depreciation rate = 21% per year

Year 2008:
Price in 2008 = Initial price - (Initial price * depreciation rate)
= $20,000 - ($20,000 * 0.21)
= $20,000 - $4,200
= $15,800

Year 2009:
Price in 2009 = Price in 2008 - (Price in 2008 * depreciation rate)
= $15,800 - ($15,800 * 0.21)
= $15,800 - $3,328
= $12,472

Year 2010:
Price in 2010 = Price in 2009 - (Price in 2009 * depreciation rate)
= $12,472 - ($12,472 * 0.21)
= $12,472 - $2,620.32
= $9,851.68

The price of the car in 2010 is $9,851.68."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to find the total number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

10% of the books are written in German, so that's 10% of 50, which is 0.1 * 50 = 5 books in German.

The total number of books written in English and German is 25 + 5 = 30.

Since there are 50 books in total, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to calculate the number of people at each stop and add them up.

Initially, Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the total number of people becomes:
120 + 20 = 140

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100) board the train. So, the total number of people becomes:
140 - 50 + 100 = 190

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the total number of people becomes:
190 - 80 = 110

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"To find the total amount Alison spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55

"To find the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to find the total number of tiles required and multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, we need to find the area of one tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of one tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Next, we need to find the total number of tiles required. To do this, we divide the total area of the kitchen floor by the area of one tile: 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles.

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile: 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72
Increased cost = $120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we need to multiply it by 12.

Annual cost = $192 * 12 = $2304

The final answer is: $2304"
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since a twin bed has 1 set of sheets and a king size bed has 1 set of sheets, he puts 4 + 1 = 5 sets of sheets on the beds every week.

Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 1, which is 2. This means he can wash 2 twin sets of sheets and 1 king set of sheets at a time.

However, since he has 5 sets of sheets to wash, we need to calculate how many times he needs to wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set. We can do this by dividing 5 by 3 (2 twin sets + 1 king set), which is 1 with a remainder of 2. This means he needs to wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set once, and then wash the remaining 2 twin sets.

So, in a week, he does 2 loads of laundry.

To find out how many loads of laundry he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads he does in a week by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:

2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads/year

1. There are 4 pizzas with 8 slices each, so the total number of slices is 4 * 8 = 32.
2. Becky ate 10 slices.
3. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.
4. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, let's add up the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:
10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31

"Let's denote Donovan's part as D and Betsy's part as B. We know that B = D + 18 and the total time is 98 minutes, so D + B = 98.

Substituting B = D + 18 into the second equation, we get D + (D + 18) = 98.

Combine like terms: 2D + 18 = 98.

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2D = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: D = 40.

Since B = D + 18, B = 40 + 18 = 58.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the costs of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The cost of the visit is $300/hour for 0.5 hours (30 minutes). So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of parking is $6/hour for 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs:

"To find out how many emails James responds to, we first need to find out how many emails he doesn't respond to. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the rest, which is 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Now, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. 

In a 5-day work week, James gets 80 * 5 = 400 emails.

Since 20% of these emails don't require a response, he doesn't respond to 0.2 * 400 = 80 emails.

So, he responds to 400 - 80 = 320 emails in a 5-day work week.

"To find the number of pizzas left, we first need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 
They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (by the glee club) + 40 (by the football team) = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 = 3500 cents.

He wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, so he wants to send out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 = 21000 cents.

The total cost of postage is the sum of the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons: 3500 + 21000 = 23500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 23500 / 100 = 235 dollars.

"To find the total cost of the butter, we need to calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter with the promotion. 

Since Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter. 

The promotion is buy one pound of butter get one half off, which means that for every 2 pounds of butter, he will pay the full price of 1 pound. 

So, for 6 pounds of butter, he will pay for 3 pounds at the full price and 3 pounds at half the price. 

The cost of 3 pounds at the full price is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00. 

The cost of 3 pounds at half the price is 3 * $2.00 = $6.00. 

The total cost of 6 pounds of butter is $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00.

The final answer is: $18.00"
"To find the total number of guests, we need to add the number of classmates, dance class members, and family members, then subtract the number of people who said they could not come.

Total guests = 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family members) - 4 (could not come) = 41

Since the initial fee is for 20 guests, we need to find the number of additional guests.
Additional guests = Total guests - 20 = 41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is $6 each, so we multiply the number of additional guests by the cost per guest.
Cost for additional guests = 21 * 6 = 126

Now, we add the initial fee and the cost for the additional guests to find the total cost.
Total cost = Initial fee + Cost for additional guests = 125 + 126 = 251

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat each day. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats. However, we know that the total number of bananas is 315, and they eat this amount for a week, which is 7 days. 

So, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315 * 7 = 2205. 

Since they eat this amount in 7 days, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 2205 / 7 = 315. 

Now we know that the first monkey eats 10 bananas and the second monkey eats 14 bananas each day. So, the third monkey eats 315 - (10 + 14) = 291 bananas each day.

"To find out how much Jenny paid for the roses, we need to determine if she bought the roses by the dozen or individually. Since she bought 15 roses, it's more cost-effective to buy a dozen (12 roses) and 3 individual roses. 

A dozen roses cost $15, and 3 individual roses cost 3 * $2 = $6. So, the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. 

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she paid with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the change is $4 and they only have quarters for change, we need to find out how many quarters make up $4. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

"To find the total time Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time Paul will wait after the third train leaves.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, we need to find the time Paul will wait for his train. Paul will wait from the time he arrives at the station to the time the fourth train arrives. Since we don't know the time Paul arrives at the station, we will assume he arrives at time 0. 

The time Paul will wait for his train is 145 minutes.

Melanie saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. 
So, the total number of toothpicks saved = 10 * 12 = 120 toothpicks.

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks in total, and she already has 120, she needs to save 200 - 120 = 80 more toothpicks.

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week. To find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she needs to save by the number of toothpicks she saves per week: 
80 / 10 = 8 weeks.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and then the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is 75% of $2000, which is 0.75 * 2000 = $1500.

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is 1.2 * 1500 = $1800.

The discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend is the difference between the original price and the price he paid, which is $2000 - $1800 = $200.

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100: ($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%.

"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

Let's start by finding the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the total earnings:

Since John goes to class for 5 days a week, the total minutes per week is 240 * 5 = 1200 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the extra minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on each of these days. 

First, we need to find the total minutes in a week. There are 7 days in a week, and there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, the total minutes in a week is 7 * 60 * 24 = 10080 minutes.

Now, we can find the extra minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday. 1/16 of 10080 is (1/16) * 10080 = 630 minutes.

Since John spends the same amount of time on both Saturday and Sunday, we need to multiply the extra minutes by 2. 630 * 2 = 1260 minutes.

Now, we add the minutes John spends in class to the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. 1200 + 1260 = 2460 minutes.

To find the total hours, we divide the total minutes by 60. 2460 / 60 = 41 hours.

The final answer is: 41"
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet.

The height of the ball after the first bounce is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

The height of the ball after the second bounce is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to convert the height of the first child to inches and then calculate the height of each child step by step.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10).

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"To find the original weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the 270 kilograms left after the Allosaurus ate.

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which is half of what was left after the velociraptors ate. So, the velociraptors ate the other half, which is also 270 kilograms.

Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left, the total weight after the T-Rex ate is 2 times 270 kilograms, which is 540 kilograms.

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate is 2 times 540 kilograms, which is 1080 kilograms.

The final answer is: 1080"
"To find the total area to be painted, we need to calculate the area of all four walls. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet.
The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet.
The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the total number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so 3 were shaken and 9 were unshaken. Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 1 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 7 sodas in total, with 1 shaken and 6 unshaken. The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans.

Probability = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of cans)
Probability = 1 / 7

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Probability = (1 / 7) * 100
Probability = 14.29%

The final answer is: 14.29"
"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

The total distance between the two trains is the sum of the distances they have traveled, which is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of days Billy helps, we first need to find the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

Now, we subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy helps: 
50 - 10 = 40

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so we need to find the total number of hours he helps per day. 
2 people/hour * 3 hours = 6 people/day

Now, we multiply the number of days Billy helps by the number of people he can help per day: 
40 days * 6 people/day = 240 people

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people who were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people who were present.

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses:
12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars:
20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the number of people transported from the total number of people present. However, the question does not provide the total number of people present. It only provides the number of private cars and buses. We can assume that the number of people present is equal to the number of people transported (i.e., 480 people) since the question does not provide any other information.

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is equal to the number of people transported, which is 480.

The final answer is: 480"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so Martha's age is 24 - 4 = 20 years old.

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the two slides:
Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 
- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes
- Total time per day: 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. 
To find the total time spent over 5 days, we multiply the daily time by 5:
1 hour * 5 = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total miles run by all three is 52. We can subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Total miles = 52
Amber's miles = 8
Micah's miles = 28
Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after returning the item and then add it to the initial charge minus the returned item.

Initial charge: $85.00
Returned item: -$15.00
New balance after return: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Frying pan: 20% off $20.00
Discount: 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Cost of frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Towels: 10% off $30.00
Discount: 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Cost of towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Total cost of new purchases: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

"Let's break down the information given:

- A fifth of the jellyfish are large.
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
- The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue.
- When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. 
A third of the large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, so x/15 = 6. 

To find the total number of jellyfish, we need to solve for x:
x/15 = 6
x = 6 * 15
x = 90

The final answer is: 90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to first find Ben's age, and then multiply it by 3.

Since Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, we can find Ben's age by multiplying Chris's age by 2:
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3:
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for her retirement. 

First, let's calculate her annual expenses in retirement: 
40% of $100,000 = 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

Since she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, the total amount she needs to save is:
$40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

Now, let's calculate how much she saves per year. 
20% of $100,000 = 0.2 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

To find out how many years she needs to work to save $800,000, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by the amount she saves per year:
$800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for her retirement. Since she already plans to live for 20 years in retirement, we need to subtract this from the total number of years:
40 - 20 = 20 years.

"To find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to determine how many days she has in June to hike. June has 30 days.

Since she wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can calculate her daily target by dividing the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since she plans to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, we can calculate her current daily total by multiplying the miles per hike by 2:

125 miles/hike * 2 hikes/day = 250 miles/day

Now, we can find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike by subtracting her current daily total from her target daily total:

310 miles/day - 250 miles/day = 60 miles/day

"To find the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers, we first need to find the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers in 10 hours. 

2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, so 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
2 workers produce 4 toys an hour, so 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. 
Total toys per hour for these 4 workers = 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour. 
Total toys produced in 10 hours = 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 400. 
So, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in 10 hours = 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Now, we know that 4 workers produced 200 toys in 10 hours. 
So, the 5th worker produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys in 10 hours. 
To find the number of toys the 5th worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the 5th worker by the number of hours worked: 
180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Kris had 7 stickers, and before giving them to Rob, he had 7 + 9 = 16 stickers.
2. Since Kris had 16 stickers, and he received them from Luis, Luis must have had 16 stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received from Seth, so he must have had an even number of stickers before giving some to Kris. Let's call the number of stickers Luis had before giving some to Kris ""x"". Since Luis gave half of the stickers to Kris, he must have given Kris x/2 stickers.
4. We know that Luis had 16 stickers after giving some to Kris, so x - x/2 = 16. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get 2x - x = 32, which simplifies to x = 32.
5. Since Luis had 32 stickers before giving some to Kris, and he received half of Seth's stickers, Seth must have had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers in the beginning.

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S. 

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, we can say A = M.

We know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. So, we can write the equation C + S = 30 and C = S + 12.

Substituting C = S + 12 into the first equation, we get S + 12 + S = 30. Combining like terms, we get 2S + 12 = 30. Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get 2S = 18. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 9.

Now that we know S = 9, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12. C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, and the total number of eggs is 56, we can write the equation A + M + C + S = 56. Substituting A = M and C = 21 and S = 9, we get M + M + 21 + 9 = 56. Combining like terms, we get 2M + 30 = 56. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2M = 26. Dividing both sides by 2, we get M = 13.

Since A = M, A is also 13.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold. C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total number of boxes and the total weight of the crayons and boxes.

Since each box can hold 8 crayons and Nik has 200 crayons, we can divide 200 by 8 to find the number of boxes: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces and there are 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is 8 * 25 = 200 ounces.

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and Nik has 200 crayons, so the total weight of the crayons is 1 * 200 = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and boxes is 200 ounces (boxes) + 200 ounces (crayons) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, we can divide 400 by 16 to find the total weight in pounds: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to calculate 80% of 80 feet. 

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet long, we need to divide the total length by 4 to find the number of logs.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks, so we multiply the number of logs by 5.

16 * 5 = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 * 1.2 = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Valerie earns $5000 per month.
2. Valerie's brother earns 2 times what Valerie earns, so he earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.
3. Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.
4. Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.
5. To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk.
2. On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. Let's denote her speed on the beach as 'x'. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x.
3. The time taken to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/x hours, since time = distance/speed.
4. The time taken to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/(2x) hours, since her speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach.
5. The total time taken to walk 3 miles is 2/x + 1/(2x) hours.
6. We are given that 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach. We need to convert this to hours: 40 minutes = 40/60 = 2/3 hours.
7. Since 2/3 hours is spent on the beach, the time taken to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/3 hours.
8. We can set up the equation: 2/x = 2/3.
9. Solving for x, we get x = 3/2.
10. Now we can find the time taken to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk: 1/(2x) = 1/(2 * 3/2) = 1/3 hours.
11. The total time taken to walk 3 miles is 2/3 + 1/3 = 1 hour.
12. To convert 1 hour to minutes, we multiply by 60: 1 * 60 = 60 minutes.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save $60, we need to first calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is:
$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60:
$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree. 

3 trees had 7 blue birds each, so 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.
2 trees had 4 blue birds each, so 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.
1 tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. So, Bob will have 60 marbles after receiving 24 more marbles.

2. To find out how many marbles Bob has initially, we need to subtract 24 from 60. 
   Initial marbles = 60 - 24 = 36

3. If Bob loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from the initial number of marbles he had.
   Marbles after losing 10 = 36 - 10 = 26

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle. 

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the two temperatures multiplied by the total ounces. 

The total ounces of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle). 

The average temperature of the two mugs is (33 + x) / 2.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

50 (initial cows) + (20 cows/day * 21 days) = 50 + 420 = 470 cows

Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

20 (initial chickens) + (10 chickens/day * 21 days) = 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is the sum of the cows and chickens.

"To find the total cost of the bagels, we need to first calculate the original cost of 4 packs of bagels. 

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs will cost 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00 to find the discount amount. 

10% of $40.00 = 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost to find the final cost of the bagels. 

$40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, and Russell ordered 4 packs, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the final cost by the total number of bagels.

$36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, Gomer ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops, it takes 3 * 2 = 6 potatoes to make 6 scoops. 

To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to find out how many groups of 6 scoops are in 18 scoops. 18 / 6 = 3. 

So, Gomer ate 3 * 6 = 18 potatoes."
"To find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

Now, we know the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can find the total number of green and red jellybeans by adding the number of green and red jellybeans.

Total green and red jellybeans = Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans
Total green and red jellybeans = 17 + 34
Total green and red jellybeans = 51

Now, we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - Total green and red jellybeans
Number of blue jellybeans = 60 - 51
Number of blue jellybeans = 9

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first find out how many sunflowers were sold in a day and then multiply it by 3.

Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers per day. Since each sunflower costs $2, the number of sunflowers sold per day is 26 / 2 = 13.

Faraday also earned $56 from the bouquets per day. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers and costs $8, the number of bouquets sold per day is 56 / 8 = 7. 

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets is 7 * 12 = 84.

The total number of sunflowers sold per day is 13 (from individual sunflowers) + 84 (from bouquets) = 97.

To find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days, we multiply 97 by 3: 97 * 3 = 291.

The final answer is: 291"
"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference between the two.

Adam has $100 to invest, and each rock costs $5. To find out how many rocks he can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Since Adam sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 60% of 20 rocks:

60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

12 * $7 = $84

The cost of buying 20 rocks at $5 each is:

20 * $5 = $100

Since Adam only sells 12 rocks, he still has 8 rocks left, which he has to pay for. The cost of these 8 rocks is:

8 * $5 = $40

The total cost of the rocks is the cost of the rocks he sold plus the cost of the rocks he didn't sell:

$100 + $40 = $140

However, Adam only made $84 from selling the rocks. To find out how much money he loses, we subtract the revenue from the total cost:

$140 - $84 = $56

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of large, medium, and small-sized picture scenes Lauren needs to draw. 

First, let's find the LCM of 45, 36, and 49. 

The prime factorization of 45 is 3^2 * 5.
The prime factorization of 36 is 2^2 * 3^2.
The prime factorization of 49 is 7^2.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
LCM(45, 36, 49) = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5 * 7^2 = 4 * 9 * 5 * 49 = 8820.

Now, let's find out how many days it will take Lauren to draw each type of picture scene:
- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

The greatest common multiple of the days is 63, but we can also find the LCM of 9, 6, and 7. 
The prime factorization of 9 is 3^2.
The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3.
The prime factorization of 7 is 7.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
LCM(9, 6, 7) = 2 * 3^2 * 7 = 42.

Since 8820 is a multiple of 42, we can divide 8820 by 42 to find the number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project:
8820 / 42 = 210.

The final answer is: 210"

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.2 in decimal form. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

The probability of both tickets winning is 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. 
   So, Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

2. Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. 
   So, Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

3. The total number of seashells collected is 27 + 22 + 11 = 60.

4. They divided the seashells equally among themselves. 
   So, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). 
So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. 
So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week.
Total carrots eaten in a week = 20 (weekdays) + 10 (weekend) = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (which is the decimal form of 60%).

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we have the lengths of both songs: 5 minutes for the first song and 8 minutes for the second song. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the profit from each day and then add them together.

On Monday, Linus bought 2 devices for $20 each. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the profit from each device is $40 - $20 = $20. Since he bought 2 devices, the total profit from Monday is 2 * $20 = $40.

On Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the profit from each device is $40 - $20 = $20. Since he bought 4 devices, the total profit from Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of one person. 

Since each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, Hortex would need 100 / 20 = 5 bottles.

Now, to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, Hortex would need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the current production from the required production: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. 

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. 

The remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $60 from the third sale. 

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs found is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we need to convert 3 dozen to a numerical value. 1 dozen is 12, so 3 dozen is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

The number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to find the size of the third apartment complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so their combined size is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400.

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. Adding this to 400 gives 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now we know the total number of apartments is 640. John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects from 640 * 3 = 1920 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 1920 * $0.40 = $768.

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

- Year 1 (5 years old): 50 fruits
- Year 2 (6 years old): 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
- Year 3 (7 years old): 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- Year 4 (8 years old): 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, but we don't know the production of a 10-year-old tree yet. Let's call the production of a 10-year-old tree 'x'. So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is x - 200.
- Year 5 (9 years old): 0 fruits
- Year 6 (10 years old): 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, we know that a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits. We can use this information to find the production of an 8-year-old tree. Since an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, the production of an 8-year-old tree is 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now we can calculate the total production of the first 4 years:
- Year 1: 50 fruits
- Year 2: 150 fruits
- Year 3: 350 fruits
- Year 4: 800 fruits
Total production of the first 4 years: 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 = 1350 fruits

Now, we can calculate the total production of the avocado tree during its 10 years of life:
- Total production of the first 4 years: 1350 fruits
- Year 5: 0 fruits
- Year 6: 1000 fruits
- Year 7: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- Year 8: 800 fruits
- Year 9: 0 fruits
- Year 10: 1000 fruits
Total production of the avocado tree during its 10 years of life: 1350 + 0 + 1000 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 4400 fruits

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the red rope as R, and the length of the yellow rope as Y. 

We know that R = 4B and B = Y - 7. 

We also know that R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting R = 4B into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Substituting B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37, we get 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides to get 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6 to get Y = 12.

Now that we know Y = 12, we can find B by substituting Y into the equation B = Y - 7, which gives B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B = 5, we can find R by substituting B into the equation R = 4B, which gives R = 4 * 5 = 20.

3. According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money. This means that $15 - x = (4/5) * $15.

4. To find the value of x, we can solve the equation: $15 - x = (4/5) * $15.
   $15 - x = $12

- There are four colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow.
- There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
- Half the mural is yellow.
- The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is the combination of red, white, and purple paint. Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as x. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the total amount of these three colors is 3x.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow. So, the other half is 6 pints (12 / 2 = 6). This 6 pints is the combination of red, white, and purple paint, which is 3x.

We can set up the equation: 3x = 6

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 6 / 3
x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and we know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since he withdraws 1000 dollars in 20 dollar bills, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home. So, he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills to pay for the bill. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he has 20 bills left, and each bill is worth $20, he has 20 * 20 = $400. Tripling this amount gives him 3 * 400 = $1200.

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we need to divide the total amount of money by 5. 1200 / 5 = 240.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then divide it by the amount used each day.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of it. 

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

So, after Monday, 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk is left.

The teacher then goes back to using 20% of the chalk each day. 

To find out how many days the chalk will last, we need to divide the remaining chalk by the amount used each day.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

"To find the total cost of Ali's order, we need to calculate the total number of bags and multiply it by the cost per bag.

First, we need to find the total number of bags:
Total coal ordered = 850 kg
Weight of each bag = 50 kg
Number of bags = Total coal ordered / Weight of each bag
= 850 / 50
= 17

Now, we need to find the total cost:
Cost per bag = $18
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
= 17 * 18
= 306

"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza that her friends will eat. 

For cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is 6 * 6 = 36. 

For pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 4 * 6 = 24.

Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices and each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, we need to divide the total number of slices eaten by the number of slices per pizza to find out how many of each type of pizza Kate needs to buy.

For cheese pizza, Kate needs 36 / 12 = 3 pizzas.

For pepperoni pizza, Kate needs 24 / 8 = 3 pizzas.

So, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

"To find the total miles Sam ran, we need to add the miles he ran on each day. 

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So, the total miles he ran on these days is 3 * 3 = 9 miles.

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So, the total miles he ran on these days is 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days: 9 + 10 = 19 miles.

The final answer is: 19"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many snowballs Jay builds and how many melt in a given time period. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is 60 minutes. So, in 15 minutes, he builds 20/60 * 15 = 5 snowballs. 

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. So, in 15 minutes, Jay has 5 - 2 = 3 snowballs left.

Now, let's calculate how many snowballs Jay has after 1 hour (60 minutes). In 60 minutes, Jay builds 20 snowballs and 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs melt (since 2 melt every 15 minutes, and there are 4 sets of 15 minutes in an hour). So, Jay has 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs after 1 hour.

Since Jay starts with 0 snowballs, he needs 60 - 12 = 48 more snowballs to reach 60. 

Now, let's calculate how many sets of 15 minutes it will take to build 48 snowballs. Jay builds 5 snowballs every 15 minutes, so he needs 48 / 5 = 9.6 sets of 15 minutes. Since Jay can't build a fraction of a snowball, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 

9.6 sets of 15 minutes is 9 sets of 15 minutes and 0.6 of a set. 0.6 of a set is 0.6 * 15 = 9 minutes. So, Jay needs 9 * 15 + 9 = 144 minutes to build 48 snowballs.

In total, Jay needs 1 hour (60 minutes) to build 12 snowballs and 144 minutes to build 48 snowballs. So, Jay needs 60 + 144 = 204 minutes to build 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: 204"
"To find Jim's age, we need to first find John's age 20 years ago. Since John is 28 now, 20 years ago he was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, Jim's age 20 years ago was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

To find Jim's current age, we add 20 to his age 20 years ago: 4 + 20 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many slices each person ate, we need to determine the number of slices each ate. 

Doxa ate 1 slice. 
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. 
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, we add up the number of slices each person ate: 
1 (Doxa) + 2 (her sister) + 3 (her brother) = 6 slices.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the information given:

- On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
- On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages (since 50 / 2 = 25).
- At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x. After the first day, they had x - 38 + 50 bandages. After the second day, they had (x - 38 + 50) - 28 bandages. After the third day, they had ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) + 100 - 25 bandages, which simplifies to (x - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25) bandages.

We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages, so we can set up the equation:

x - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78

Combine like terms:

x + 59 = 78

Subtract 59 from both sides:

x = 19

"To find Jen's total earnings, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total attendance bonus.

Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, she works a total of:
7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week
45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Her total earnings from her hourly rate are:
180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen has complete attendance for the month, she also receives an additional $10 for each day. There are 6 days in a week, and 4 weeks in April, so she receives:
6 days/week * 4 weeks = 24 days
24 days * $10/day = $240

Her total earnings are the sum of her hourly earnings and her attendance bonus:
$270 + $240 = $510

"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately and then add them together.

Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

She bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. So, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

The total number of pens Alain has is the sum of red and black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

"To find the total cost, we first need to find the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. So, the cost per bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of cognac per bottle is 50% more than the cost of scotch per bottle. 50% of $60 is $30, so the cost of cognac per bottle is $60 + $30 = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the sum of the cost of scotch and cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

- On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, so he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day.
- On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total number of White Oak trees is 20 + 10 = 30.
- He planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days:
Total White Oak trees = 20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 30
Total Lodgepole Pine trees = 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90
Total trees = 30 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 120

"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as 'x'. 

The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as an equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. 

First, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

The number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one palette, so Amy lost 4 colors. Now, Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors.

Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 colors from the makeup set. Now, she has 18 - 3 = 15 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

"To find the total volume of the jar, we need to multiply the length, width, and height of the jar. 

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume used by the jelly beans will be 80% of the total volume. 

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Since a jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of a single jelly bean.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of a single jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. 
   Let's say the number of cupcakes is x. Then, the number of brownies is 3x - 2.

2. Each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. 
   So, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

3. The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies. 
   So, we can write the equation: x + (3x - 2) = 10

4. Now, let's solve the equation: 
   x + 3x - 2 = 10
   4x - 2 = 10
   4x = 12
   x = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total cost, first, calculate the discount on the manicure and pedicure. 

The discount on the manicure is 20% of $35, which is 0.2 * 35 = $7. 
The discount on the pedicure is 20% of $40, which is 0.2 * 40 = $8.

The total discount is $7 + $8 = $15.

The cost of the manicure after the discount is $35 - $7 = $28.
The cost of the pedicure after the discount is $40 - $8 = $32.

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure is $28 + $32 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers, the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art is $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them up.

The first 3 magazines send 12 issues a year, so that's 3 * 12 = 36 issues.

The second magazine sends 6 issues a year.

The third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues.

Now, let's add up the total number of issues: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

The final answer is: 66"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Samantha has 27 paintings.
2. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley.
   So, Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.
3. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim.
   So, Kim has 39 - 8 = 31 paintings.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to calculate the price after each discount.

In November, the price was $40.

"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make, we need to calculate the amount from the standard lessons and the amount from the veteran lessons separately, then add them together.

For the standard lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. 
Total amount from standard lessons = 4 * $80 = $320

For the veteran lessons, Charlie reduces his rate by 25%. 
25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20
New rate for veteran lessons = $80 - $20 = $60 per hour
Charlie has 2 lessons with a veteran at the new rate.
Total amount from veteran lessons = 2 * $60 = $120

Total amount of money Charlie will make for the day = $320 + $120 = $440

"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The sum of the scores is 630.

There are 9 scores in total.

Now, let's divide the sum by the total number of scores:

"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first determine how many pomelos she had left. Since she was left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can calculate this as follows:

Original amount: 20 pomelos
1/4 of the original amount: 20 * 1/4 = 5 pomelos

Since Eve was left with 5 pomelos, we can find out how many she gave away by subtracting the amount she had left from the original amount:

Pomelos given away: 20 - 5 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the number of apples Walter ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60. 

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. 

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

60 - 24 = 36

Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. 

25% of 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. 

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining apples at $3 each. 

27 * 3 = 81

The final answer is: 81"
"To find the total number of novels Regina wrote this year, we need to determine the total number of novels represented by 4 quarters (since 3 quarters are given). 

Let's denote the total number of novels written this year as 'x'. Since 3 quarters of 'x' is equal to 9, we can set up the equation:

3/4 * x = 9

To solve for 'x', we multiply both sides by 4/3:

x = 9 * (4/3)
x = 12

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To find the total distance covered by Michael in 3 days, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours he traveled in 3 days. 

Since there are 24 hours in a day, Michael traveled for 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we multiply his average speed by the total hours traveled: 
50 km/hr * 72 hr = 3600 km

Now, we need to find the percentage of the distance covered by Michael. To do this, we divide the distance covered by the total distance between Alaska and Texas, and then multiply by 100.

Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
= 0.6 * 100
= 60%

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.
3. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.
4. The remaining grapes are used by their mother to make pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the number of pies she can make is 36 / 12 = 3 pies.
5. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used by their mother is 3 * 12 = 36 grapes.
6. The total number of grapes used by all three is 36 (by Madeline) + 30 (by her brother) + 36 (by their mother) = 102 grapes.
7. Since the total number of grapes used is 102, the initial number of grapes is 102 + the number of grapes left. However, we don't know the number of grapes left. We can find it by subtracting the total number of grapes used from the initial number of grapes. Since we don't know the initial number of grapes, let's call it x. The number of grapes left is x - 102.
8. However, we know that the number of grapes left is used to make 3 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the number of grapes left is 3 * 12 = 36 grapes.
9. Now we can set up an equation to find the initial number of grapes: x - 102 = 36.
10. Solving for x, we get x = 36 + 102 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of teachers at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of sick teachers = 13

"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the total cost per week and then multiply it by 52 (the number of weeks in a year).

The cost of pasta per week is $1.00.
The cost of cheddar cheese per week is $3.00.
The cost of gruyere cheese per week is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

The total cost per week is $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

To find the total cost per year, multiply the weekly cost by 52:
$10.00 * 52 = $520.00

The final answer is: $520.00"
"To find the total number of minutes the custodian works in a day, we multiply the number of hours by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day

The total number of classrooms is 80, and it takes 15 minutes per classroom. 

80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

The total number of minutes the custodian needs to clean all classrooms is 1200 minutes. 

To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we divide the total minutes spent cleaning by the total minutes worked in a day, and then multiply by 100.

(1200 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100 = 250%

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms on average."
"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to determine the capacity of each shelf. 

The middle shelves can hold 10 books each. 
The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.
The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:
Middle shelf 1: 10 books
Middle shelf 2: 10 books
Bottom shelf: 20 books
Top shelf: 15 books
Total capacity of one bookcase: 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase to find out how many bookcases she needs:
110 / 55 = 2

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total cost of the eggs, we need to multiply the number of dozens by the cost per dozen. 

5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the total number of eggs is 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Rose will sell the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs. To find the selling price per egg, we divide $1 by 3.

$1 / 3 = $0.33 per egg

Now, we multiply the total number of eggs by the selling price per egg to find the total revenue.

60 eggs * $0.33/egg = $20

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

The final answer is: $8"

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. We know that B = 5S - 4. We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so S + B = 116.

We can substitute the expression for B into the second equation: S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know S, we can find B: B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 is 4, so 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each.

The total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.
The total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones:

"To find John's new speaking speed, we need to multiply his original speed by 2.5. 

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can convert WPM to words per second by dividing by 60.

New speed (words per second) = 375 WPM / 60 = 6.25 words per second

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. 

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words per page = 4500 words

To find the time it takes to speak 4500 words, we can divide the total number of words by the new speed.

Time = Total words / New speed (words per second) = 4500 words / 6.25 words per second = 720 seconds

On the second day, Conor saw 20 more people than on the first day, so he saw 50 + 20 = 70 people.
On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so he saw 2 * 70 = 140 people.

The total number of people Conor saw on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to find the number of seeds in a large sunflower. 

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which is 18. Then, we add this to the number of seeds in a small sunflower: 36 + 18 = 54 seeds in a large sunflower.

Now, we add the number of seeds in a small sunflower and a large sunflower to find the total number of seeds: 36 + 54 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we first need to determine how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, Timothy has 3 * 18 = 54 pens.

Next, we need to find out how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we divide the number of pens Timothy has by 2. So, Sarah has 54 / 2 = 27 pens.

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Jake buys 2 T-shirts, so the total cost of the T-shirts is 2 * $8 = $16. However, since there's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake only pays for one T-shirt at the full price and the other one at 50% off. So, the cost of the first T-shirt is $8 and the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

The original price of the shoes is $40, and Jake buys them at 40% off. The discount on the shoes is $40 * 0.4 = $16. So, the cost of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is the cost of the T-shirts plus the cost of the shoes, which is $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his total earnings from doing chores and subtract the cost of ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 each week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are 6 * 3 = $18.

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each, so the total cost of ice cream cones is 4 * 1.25 = $5.

Now, let's subtract the cost of ice cream cones from his total earnings: 18 - 5 = $13.

Now, we need to find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with $13. Each ticket costs $6.50, so we divide 13 by 6.50 to get the number of tickets: 13 / 6.50 = 2.

"To find out how many cookies Randy has now, we need to calculate the total number of cookies he had initially and then subtract the cookies he ate or gave away, and add the cookies he baked.

Initially, Randy had 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. 

Total cookies initially = 9 + 4 + 5 = 18

Randy ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. 
So, he ate 3 cookies in total.

Randy ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch.

Randy gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends.

Total cookies eaten or given away = 3 (snack) + 2 (lunch) + 2 (given away) = 7

Randy baked 4 of each flavor for dinner. 
So, he baked 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 cookies.

Total cookies added = 12

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies Randy has now:
Total cookies initially - Total cookies eaten or given away + Total cookies added
= 18 - 7 + 12

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then find out how many holes Nate fills in per day. 

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, so the net number of holes filled in per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes.

To find out how many days it takes to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled in per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of days by 7 to find the number of weeks: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested (16), so he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
- He gathered two more Petri dishes than requested (14), so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
- He gathered the correct number of beakers (7).
- The total number of items on the lab bench is 29.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

8 (test tubes) + 7 (beakers) + 16 (Petri dishes) + x (lost beakers) = 29

Combine the known quantities:
8 + 7 + 16 = 31

Now, subtract 31 from both sides of the equation to isolate x:
31 + x = 29
x = 29 - 31
x = -2

However, since we can't have a negative number of lost beakers, this means that Igor didn't lose any beakers. The correct interpretation is that the equation is not balanced, and the correct number of beakers should be 29 - 8 - 16 = 5. 

So, the correct number of beakers Igor had initially is 7, and the correct number of items on the lab bench is 8 + 7 + 16 = 31. Since the total number of items on the lab bench is 29, Igor must have lost 31 - 29 = 2 beakers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron.
2. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
3. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if Vanessa runs 4 miles, Aaron would run half the distance, which is 2 miles.

Since Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and he ran 2 miles, we can find his speed. Speed = Distance / Time = 2 miles / 16 minutes = 1/8 miles per minute.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's speed, which is 1/16 miles per minute.

Now, we can find the time it took Vanessa to complete her part of the race. Time = Distance / Speed = 4 miles / (1/16 miles per minute) = 4 * 16 = 64 minutes.

"To find the total cost, first, calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. 

The original cost of the radiator is $400. 
The discount is 80% off, so the discount amount is 80% of $400, which is 0.8 * $400 = $320.
The cost of the radiator after the discount is $400 - $320 = $80.

Next, calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor. 
The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour, so the total labor cost is 3 * $50 = $150.

The total cost is the cost of the radiator plus the labor cost, which is $80 + $150 = $230.

"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that C + W = 20 (total number of animals) and 2C + 2W = 70 (total number of legs).

We can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2, resulting in C + W = 35.

Now we have two equations: C + W = 20 and C + W = 35. We can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate W, resulting in 0 = 15. This is a contradiction, which means our initial assumption that the two equations are independent is incorrect.

However, we can rewrite the second equation as C = 35 - W and substitute it into the first equation: (35 - W) + W = 20. This simplifies to 35 = 20, which is also a contradiction.

This means that our initial assumption that the number of chickens and cows is a whole number is incorrect. However, we can try to find the closest whole number solution.

However, we can try to find the closest whole number solution. If we assume that the number of cows is W = 0.5, then the number of chickens is C = 20 - 0.5 = 19.5. However, this results in 2(19.5) + 2(0.5) = 39 + 1 = 40, which is not equal to 70.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we find the total number of slices: 7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices.

Then, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 slices / (1 + 3) people = 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person.

The final answer is: 14"
