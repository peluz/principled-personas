"Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 and bakes 4, so she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

She has 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left. 

She sells 9 eggs for $2 each. So, she makes 9 x 2 = $18."
"To make a robe, we need 2 bolts of blue fiber. 

For the white fiber, it says it's half of the blue fiber. Half of 2 is 1. 

So, we need 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber. 

2 + 1 = 3 

The answer is 3."
"Josh buys a house for $80,000. He puts in $50,000 in repairs. 

First, we need to find the value of the house after the repairs. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. This means the value of the house after repairs is 150% of the original value plus the original value. 

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 x $80,000 = $120,000. 

The value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh bought the house for $80,000 and sold it for $200,000. To find the profit, we need to subtract the cost from the selling price. 

Profit = Selling price - Cost
Profit = $200,000 - $80,000
Profit = $120,000

The final answer is: $120,000"
James runs 3 sprints a day. 3 sprints a week is 3 x 3 = 9 sprints. He runs 60 meters each sprint. 9 sprints x 60 meters = 540 meters.
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to know how many cups of feed she gives in total and divide it by 3. 

First, we need to find out how many cups of feed Wendi gives in total. She gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. 

15 + 25 = 40 cups

Now, we need to divide the total cups of feed by 3 to find out how many cups she needs to give in the final meal. 

40 / 3 = 13.33 

But we can't give a fraction of a cup of feed to the chickens. So, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. 

13.33 is closer to 13 than 14. 

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 13 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"Let's break it down. 

First, we need to find out how much one glass costs when it's 60% of the price. 60% of 5 dollars is 0.6 x 5 = 3 dollars. 

Now, we have two types of glasses: the normal ones that cost 5 dollars and the cheaper ones that cost 3 dollars. We need to find out how many of each Kylar will buy. 

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, let's divide 16 by 2 to see how many of each type he will buy. 16 / 2 = 8. So, Kylar will buy 8 normal glasses and 8 cheaper glasses.

Now, let's calculate the cost of each type of glass. 8 normal glasses cost 8 x 5 = 40 dollars. 8 cheaper glasses cost 8 x 3 = 24 dollars.

Now, let's add the cost of both types of glasses. 40 + 24 = 64 dollars.

The final answer is: 64"
"Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Seattle has 20 sheep. So, Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has 80 sheep. So, Toulouse has 2 x 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together. 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. 

First, Carla downloads 40% of the file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 x 200 = 80 GB. 

It takes Carla 80 / 2 = 40 minutes to download 80 GB. 

Then, Carla has to download the remaining 160 GB. It takes Carla 160 / 2 = 80 minutes to download 160 GB. 

But Carla has to download the first 80 GB again. It takes Carla 80 / 2 = 40 minutes to download 80 GB again. 

So, Carla downloads the file in 40 + 80 + 40 = 160 minutes. 

The answer is 160."
"Let's break it down step by step.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move at all.

Next, he drives for half an hour (0.5 hours) at 30 mph. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

After that, he drives for the remaining 2 hours (4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles.

Now, let's add up all the distances: 180 + 0 + 15 + 120 = 315 miles.

So, John is 315 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

The final answer is: 315"
"To find Eliza's earnings, we need to find out how much she earns from her regular hours and her overtime hours.

First, let's find out how much she earns from her regular hours. She works 40 hours at $10 per hour, so she earns 40 x 10 = $400.

Next, let's find out how much she earns from her overtime hours. She worked 45 hours in total, so she worked 45 - 40 = 5 overtime hours. Her overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, so her overtime pay is 1.2 x 10 = $12 per hour. She earns 5 x 12 = $60 from her overtime hours.

Now, let's add her earnings from regular hours and overtime hours. 400 + 60 = 460.

Her earnings for this week are $460.

"Let's break it down step by step.

First month: 60 downloads
Second month: 3 times as many as the first month, so 3 x 60 = 180 downloads
Third month: 30% less than the second month, so we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180
30% of 180 is 0.3 x 180 = 54
So, 180 - 54 = 126 downloads in the third month

Now, let's add up the downloads for all three months:
60 + 180 + 126 = 366

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to multiply the number of each item by its price and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the donuts: 3 dozen donuts * $68 per dozen = 3 x 68 = $204

Next, let's find the cost of the mini cupcakes: 2 dozen mini cupcakes * $80 per dozen = 2 x 80 = $160

Then, let's find the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen mini cheesecakes * $55 per dozen = 6 x 55 = $330

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

The total cost is $694."
"Let's break it down step by step.

1. The tree costs $90 to plant. 
2. Each year, the tree makes $10.5 (7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon).
3. It costs $3 to water and feed the tree each year.
4. So, the profit each year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.
5. To find out how many years it will take to earn money, we need to find out when the total profit will be more than the cost of planting the tree.

"Let's break it down step by step.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. If we say she started with x vacuum cleaners, then she sold x/3 at the green house.

She had x - x/3 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house.

Then, she sold 2 more at the red house. So, she had (x - x/3) - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Now, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of (x - x/3) - 2 is ((x - x/3) - 2)/2.

We know that after all these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

(x - x/3) - 2 - ((x - x/3) - 2)/2 = 5

To solve this equation, we need to simplify it first.

First, let's simplify the fraction (x - x/3) - 2. We can rewrite x - x/3 as 2x/3. So, (x - x/3) - 2 becomes 2x/3 - 2.

Now, our equation is: 2x/3 - 2 - (2x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify the fraction (2x/3 - 2)/2, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 2. This gives us (4x/3 - 4)/2, which simplifies to 2x/3 - 2.

Now, our equation is: 2x/3 - 2 - (2x/3 - 2) = 5

We can simplify this by combining like terms: 2x/3 - 2x/3 = 0. So, our equation becomes: 0 - 2 = 5

This doesn't make sense, so let's go back to the previous step and try to simplify the fraction (2x/3 - 2)/2 in a different way.

We can rewrite (2x/3 - 2) as (2x/3 - 6/3) by finding a common denominator. This gives us (2x/3 - 6/3)/2, which simplifies to (2x - 6)/6.

Now, our equation is: 2x/3 - 2 - (2x - 6)/6 = 5

To simplify this, we can multiply the whole equation by 6 to get rid of the fractions. This gives us 4x - 12 - (2x - 6) = 30

Now, let's simplify the equation: 4x - 2x - 12 + 6 = 30

This simplifies to 2x - 6 = 30

Now, let's add 6 to both sides: 2x = 36

Finally, let's divide both sides by 2: x = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"First, we find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 is 4. 

Now, we have 20 - 4 = 16 students left. 

25% of 16 is 4. 

Now, we have 16 - 4 = 12 students left. 

These 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance. 

To find the percentage, we divide 12 by 20 and multiply by 100. 

12 / 20 = 0.6 
0.6 * 100 = 60 

The final answer is: 60"

"I don't understand the question. Are you asking for the total distance each train traveled in two days? 

Let me try to solve it. 

The first day, both trains travel 80 miles west. The next day, they travel 150 miles north. 

So, the total distance traveled by each train is 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles.

The answer is 230."
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to find out how much she earns from teaching and coaching separately, then add them together.

First, let's find out how much she earns from teaching. She works 35 hours a week for 50 weeks. 

35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year

She earns $20 per hour, so we multiply the hours she works by her hourly wage.

1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Now, let's find out how much she earns from coaching. She works 15 hours a week for 50 weeks.

15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year

She earns $30 per hour, so we multiply the hours she works by her hourly wage.

750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, we add the money she earns from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary.

$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to know how many days are in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week. 

7 days in a week * 4 weeks = 28 days

Claire eats 3 eggs every morning. So in 28 days, she will eat 3 eggs * 28 days = 84 eggs.

There are 12 eggs in a dozen. To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12.

84 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 7 dozens of eggs."
"Marissa walked 4 miles in 1 hour, so her speed for the first 4 miles is 4 miles per hour. Then she walked 2 miles in 1 hour, so her speed for the next 2 miles is 2 miles per hour. 

She walked 4 + 2 = 6 miles in 2 hours. She wants to walk a total of 12 miles in 3 hours to get an average speed of 4 miles per hour. 

She already walked 6 miles in 2 hours, so she has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left to walk. She has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles. 

To find her speed, we divide the distance by the time. So, 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour. 

The final answer is: 6"
"First, I need to find out how much water is in the orange drink. 2/3 of 10 liters is water. To find 2/3 of 10, I will multiply 10 by 2 and then divide by 3. 

10 x 2 = 20
20 / 3 = 6.67

So, 6.67 liters of the orange drink is water. But I spilled 1 liter, so I need to subtract 1 from 6.67. 

6.67 - 1 = 5.67

Now, I need to find out how much water is in the pineapple drink. 3/5 of 15 liters is water. To find 3/5 of 15, I will multiply 15 by 3 and then divide by 5.

15 x 3 = 45
45 / 5 = 9

So, 9 liters of the pineapple drink is water. 

Now, I need to add the water from the orange drink and the pineapple drink. 

5.67 + 9 = 14.67

Now, I need to add the total amount of water to the total amount of drink. The total amount of drink is 24 liters. 

14.67 + 24 = 38.67

But I need to find out how much water is in the remaining 24 liters. So, I will divide 38.67 by 24 and then multiply by 24 to find the water in 24 liters. 

38.67 / 24 = 1.609
1.609 x 24 = 38.616

But I made a mistake. I need to find the water in 24 liters, not the total amount of water. So, I will multiply 38.616 by 24/24 to get the water in 24 liters.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, 3 customers bought 1 DVD each. So, 3 x 1 = 3 DVDs.

Then, 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each. So, 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.

Now, we add the DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers. 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so we don't need to add anything for them.

So, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"The candle melts 2 centimeters every hour. We need to find out how many hours it will burn from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. 

1:00 PM to 2:00 PM is 1 hour, 
2:00 PM to 3:00 PM is 1 hour, 
3:00 PM to 4:00 PM is 1 hour, 
4:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 1 hour.

So, the candle will burn for 4 hours. 

The candle melts 2 centimeters every hour, so it will melt 2 x 4 = 8 centimeters in 4 hours.

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"Let's say the original price of the book is x.

Since there's a 25% discount, that means 25% of the original price is subtracted from the original price to get the discounted price.

25% of x is 0.25x.

So, the discounted price is x - 0.25x = 0.75x.

We know the discounted price is $19.50, so we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To find x, we need to divide both sides by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book is $26."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money Marie spent on chicken meal, milk, and apples.

The chicken meal costs $12.
5 packs of milk cost $3 each, so 5 x $3 = $15.
4 apples cost $1.50 each, so 4 x $1.50 = $6.

Now, let's add the cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples together: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50, and she spent $33 on chicken meal, milk, and apples. So, the money she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so to find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to divide the money she spent on pizza by the cost of each box: $17 ÷ $8.50 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"

"Let's break it down step by step. 

One pair of heels costs $33. The other pair costs twice as much, so it costs 2 x 33 = 66 dollars.

The two pairs of heels together cost 33 + 66 = 99 dollars.

The two pairs of heels cost 5 dollars less than the boots. So, the boots cost 99 + 5 = 104 dollars.

"Let's say Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x. 

Since their total age is 162, we can write an equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now we know Darrell's age is 7x = 7(9) = 63 and Allen's age is 11x = 11(9) = 99.

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109

"Let's break it down step by step.

The first friend says 80 jelly beans.

The second friend says 20 more than half of 80. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 40 + 20 = 60.

The third friend says 25% more than 80. 25% of 80 is 0.25 x 80 = 20. So, 25% more than 80 is 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, we have three guesses: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we add them up and divide by 3.

80 + 60 + 100 = 240

Now, we divide by 3:

240 / 3 = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"John takes care of 10 dogs. Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. 

To find out how many hours John spends taking care of dogs in a day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the hours each dog takes. 

10 dogs * 0.5 hours = 5 hours

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the hours John spends in a day by 7.

5 hours * 7 days = 35 hours

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of dogs.

"Let's say Gretchen has x silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, she has x + 30 gold coins.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, the sum of silver and gold coins is 110. 

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms: 
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides: 
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2: 
x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, she has 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.

The answer is 70."
"Let's break it down step by step.

Raymond has 40 jewels. 

Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Half of Raymond's jewels is 40 / 2 = 20. So, Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

"Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes. 

To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we need to find 25% of 4 points. 

25% of 4 is 4 x 0.25 = 1. 

So, Mike scores 4 + 1 = 5 points in the second 20 minutes.

Now, we add the points from both 20 minutes. 
4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.  To find out how many yogurts he eats in 30 days, we need to multiply 2 yogurts by 30 days.

2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

They are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00.  To find out how much 1 yogurt costs, we need to divide $5.00 by 4 yogurts.

$5.00 / 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Now, we need to find out how much 60 yogurts cost.  We can multiply 60 yogurts by $1.25 per yogurt.

60 yogurts * $1.25 per yogurt = $75.00

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

$75.00"

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to know how many miles he runs in one hour. 

John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week. 

First, we need to find out how many miles he runs in 3 days. 
60 miles / 3 days = 20 miles per day

He runs 3 hours the first day. 
He runs half as much the other two days, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours on the other two days.

So, the total hours he runs in 3 days is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

Now, we need to find out how many miles he runs in 1 hour. 
20 miles / 6 hours = 3.33 miles per hour.

So, John runs 3.33 miles per hour.

"I don't know what ""skip"" means. Is it like jumping? 

Okay, let's try to solve the problem. 

Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour. She can run four times faster than she can walk, so if she can skip at 3 miles per hour, she can run at 3 x 4 = 12 miles per hour. 

She can run at 12 miles per hour and walk at 12 / 4 = 3 miles per hour. 

She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, she runs for 2 hours and walks for 4 hours. 

She can run 12 miles per hour, so in 2 hours she can run 12 x 2 = 24 miles. 

She can walk 3 miles per hour, so in 4 hours she can walk 3 x 4 = 12 miles. 

So, she can travel 24 + 12 = 36 miles in 6 hours.

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

If a 300g bag has 5 servings, you can eat 0.8 servings from a 300g bag. 0.8 x 300g = 240g."
"To find the net profit, we need to find the cost and the selling price first.

The cost of making 20 candles is the cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks because 20 candles are made from 2 pounds of beeswax. 
The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.

The selling price of 20 candles is 20 x $2.00 = $40.00.

The net profit is the selling price minus the cost. 
Net profit = $40.00 - $10.00 = $30.00

"Let's break it down step by step.

Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is 2. 
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday. 
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. 
She wrote 7 x 2 = 14 articles on Wednesday.

Now, let's find the total number of articles she wrote in the three days. 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Each article takes 4 hours to write. 
So, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is 26 x 4 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"

Candice started with 80 post-it notes. 

She put 1 post-it note on each of 220 cups of coffee. So, she used 220 post-it notes at work. 

Now, she has 80 - 220 = -140 post-it notes left. But we know she has 23 post-it notes remaining. So, she must have gotten some more post-it notes. 

Let's say she got x post-it notes in the package. Then, she has 80 + x - 220 = 23 post-it notes left. 

Now, let's solve for x. 

80 + x - 220 = 23 

x - 140 = 23 

x = 23 + 140 

x = 163

John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. So, he bought 200 / 40 = 5 blue ties.

He buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so he bought 2 x 5 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. 50% of $40 is $20, so the red ties cost $40 + $20 = $60 each.

He bought 10 red ties at $60 each, so he spent 10 x 60 = $600 on red ties.

In total, he spent $200 on blue ties and $600 on red ties, so he spent $200 + $600 = $800 on ties.

Since Lloyd sells eggs for $2 per dozen, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs he sells in a week. 

There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we need to divide the total number of eggs per week by 12.

1764 eggs per week / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week.

Now, we multiply the number of dozen eggs per week by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week.

147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week.

The final answer is: $294"
"Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM, that's 3 hours.  He goes back at 6 mph.  To find out how long it takes him to get back, we need to divide the distance by the speed.  The distance is the same, so it's 10 miles.  10 miles / 6 mph is 1.67 hours."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Uriah removes 30 comic books that weigh 1/4 pound each. To find the total weight of the comic books, we multiply the number of comic books by their weight:

30 comic books * 1/4 pound = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds

Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. He has already removed 7.5 pounds from the comic books. To find out how many more pounds he needs to remove, we subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight:

15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds

Now, we know that Uriah's toys weigh 1/2 pound each. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

7.5 pounds / 0.5 pounds = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"Let's break it down. 

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
For truck tires, the mechanic earns 6 x $60 = $360. 
For car tires, the mechanic earns 4 x $40 = $160. 
So, the total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and didn't repair any truck tires. 
For car tires, the mechanic earns 12 x $40 = $480.

Now, we need to find out which day had higher revenue. 
Thursday's revenue is $520 and Friday's revenue is $480. 
So, Thursday had higher revenue.

Now, we need to find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on Thursday than on Friday. 
$520 - $480 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"The Doubtfire sisters have 7 kittens from the shelter. 

Patchy has thrice the number of adopted kittens, so that's 3 x 7 = 21 kittens. 

Trixie has 12 kittens. 

So, the total number of kittens is 7 + 21 + 12 = 40. 

The answer is 40."
"Jean has 30 lollipops. Jean eats 2 of the lollipops. So, Jean has 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left.

Jean wants to put 2 lollipops in one bag. To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to divide the number of lollipops left by 2.

28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags."
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to know how much money he spends each time he goes. He spends $7 for a ticket and $7 for popcorn, so that's a total of $7 + $7 = $14.

Now, we need to divide the money Peter has ($42) by the money he spends each time ($14) to find out how many times he can go to the movies.

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times."
"To find the maximum number of boxes, we need to subtract the weight of the truck and the driver from the bridge's weight limit, then divide by the weight of one box.

First, we subtract the weight of the truck and the driver from the bridge's weight limit: 
5000 - 3755 = 1245

Then, we divide the result by the weight of one box: 
1245 / 15 = 83

So, the maximum number of boxes is 83."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much the 25% fee is. 25% of $40 is 0.25 x 40 = $10. 

Now, we add the 25% fee to the original price: $40 + $10 = $50.

Then, we add the delivery fee: $50 + $3 = $53.

Finally, we add the tip: $53 + $4 = $57.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to add the number of raspberries in the clusters and the individual raspberries.

There are 6 clusters with 20 raspberries in each cluster. So, we multiply 6 by 20 to find the total number of raspberries in the clusters.

6 x 20 = 120

Now, we add the 120 raspberries from the clusters to the 67 individual raspberries.

120 + 67 = 187

So, there are 187 raspberries in total."
"Let's break it down step by step.

There are 25 oranges in total. 

1 is bad, so we subtract 1 from 25: 25 - 1 = 24

20% of the oranges are unripe. 20% of 25 is 0.2 x 25 = 5. So, 5 oranges are unripe.

2 oranges are sour.

Now, we have 1 bad, 5 unripe, and 2 sour oranges. Let's add them together: 1 + 5 + 2 = 8

We subtract these 8 oranges from the total: 25 - 8 = 17

So, the rest of the oranges are good. The answer is 17."
"First, Janet paid $500 for the material. 
Then, she paid $800 for the jeweler. 
So, she paid $500 + $800 = $1300. 

Next, she paid 10% of $1300 to get it insured. 
10% of $1300 is 0.1 x $1300 = $130. 

So, she paid $1300 + $130 = $1430. 

The final answer is: $1430"
"I don't understand the question. Is it asking how much money Marcy will get after 30 years? 

Okay, let me try to solve it. 

Marcy gets $50,000 per year for 10 years (40 - 30 = 10). 

Then, she gets 5% more of the $50,000 per year for 20 years (30 - 10 = 20). 

5% of $50,000 is $2,500. 

So, for 20 years, she gets $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500 per year.

$52,500 for 20 years is $52,500 * 20 = $1,050,000.

Now, we need to find 5% of $1,050,000. 

5% of $1,050,000 is $52,500.

So, Marcy gets $52,500 per year for 20 years.

Now, we need to add $52,500 to $50,000. 

$52,500 + $50,000 = $102,500.

So, Marcy's annual pension will be $102,500."
"First, we need to find out how much Aleena paid for the first half of the year. The first half of the year is 6 months. 

6 months * $140 per month = $840

Now, we need to find out how much Aleena paid for the second half of the year. The second half of the year is also 6 months. But the company charged her 10% less money. 

10% of $140 is $14. So, 10% less than $140 is $140 - $14 = $126.

6 months * $126 per month = $756

Now, we need to add the money she paid for the first half and the second half of the year.

$840 + $756 = $1596

The final answer is: $1596"
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to know how many miles she can drive per gallon. 

We know that she put in 4 gallons of gas to fill up her tank, and she traveled 100 miles since the last time she filled up. 

To find out how many miles she can drive per gallon, we can divide the miles she traveled by the gallons of gas she used. 

100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know how many miles she can drive per gallon, we can multiply this by the total number of gallons her tank holds. 

12 gallons * 25 miles per gallon = 300 miles

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

The final answer is: 300"
"Jim watches TV for 2 hours. Then he reads for half as long, so he reads for 2 / 2 = 1 hour. 

So, in one day, Jim watches TV for 2 hours and reads for 1 hour. That's 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 

He does this 3 times a week, so in one week, he watches TV and reads for 3 x 3 = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, he watches TV and reads for 9 x 4 = 36 hours.

The final answer is 36."
"There are 4 schools. Each school has 2 teams (girls and boys) and each team has 5 players and 1 coach.

The answer is 48."
"Let's break it down step by step.

There were 175 diamonds. 
There were 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, so there were 175 - 35 = 140 rubies.

There were twice the number of emeralds than rubies, so there were 2 x 140 = 280 emeralds.

To find the total number of gems, we need to add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together: 175 + 140 + 280 = 595.

The final answer is: 595"
"There are 60 girls. If there are twice as many boys as girls, then there are 60 x 2 = 120 boys.

There are 60 girls and 120 boys, so there are 60 + 120 = 180 students.

If there are 5 students to every teacher, then we need to divide the number of students by 5 to find the number of teachers.

"Bailey gets $5 a week for 8 weeks. To find out how much money she got from her allowance, we need to multiply 5 by 8.

5 x 8 = 40

So, Bailey got $40 from her allowance. 

Now, we know that at the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. To find out how much money she started with, we need to subtract the money she got from her allowance from the total amount of money she has.

100 - 40 = 60

Okay, let me try to solve it. Shiela bought 5 cell phones for $150 each. So, the total cost of the cell phones is 5 x 150 = 750 dollars. 

There is a 2% interest for each unit. 2% of 750 is 0.02 x 750 = 15 dollars. 

So, the total amount Shiela will pay is 750 + 15 = 765 dollars. 

Since Shiela will pay this amount in 3 months, we need to divide 765 by 3. 

765 / 3 = 255

So, Shiela will pay 255 dollars each month for 3 months."

Now, let's calculate the total money Artie will make from each type of flower:
- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3 per pot = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2 per pot = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2 per pot = $34

"Let's break it down step by step. 

The top level has a square footage of 16. 
The second level will have half of that, so it's 16 / 2 = 8. 
The third level will have half of that, so it's 8 / 2 = 4. 
The fourth level will have half of that, so it's 4 / 2 = 2.

Now, we need to find the average square footage of a level. To do that, we need to add up all the levels and divide by the number of levels.

Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food for 180 days. So, she will use 180 cups of dog food in the first 180 days. 

Now, we need to find out how many days the puppy will live after 180 days. The puppy will live 365 - 180 = 185 days after 180 days.

Now, we need to find out how many cups of dog food the puppy will eat in 185 days. The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day. So, the puppy will eat 185 x 2 = 370 cups of dog food in 185 days.

Now, we need to find out the total cups of dog food the puppy will eat in a year. The puppy eats 180 cups of dog food in the first 180 days and 370 cups of dog food in the next 185 days. So, the puppy will eat 180 + 370 = 550 cups of dog food in a year.

Now, we need to find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in a year. One bag of dog food contains 110 cups. So, Cecilia will use 550 / 110 = 5 bags of dog food in a year.

"Let's think about this. 

If Vincent buys 18 flowers in packages of 3, he will need 6 packages because 18 divided by 3 is 6. 6 packages of 3 flowers will cost 6 x $2.50 = $15.

If Vincent buys 18 flowers in packages of 2, he will need 9 packages because 18 divided by 2 is 9. 9 packages of 2 flowers will cost 9 x $1 = $9.

So, buying in packages of 2 is cheaper. Vincent will save $15 - $9 = $6 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

First, we know that the 16 ounce can of tomatoes is used to make 32 ounces of sauce. Since the sauce is made by cooking the tomatoes, the volume of the tomatoes is half of the sauce. So, the volume of the tomatoes is 32 / 2 = 16 ounces.

Since each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes, we can find out how many cans of tomatoes Freda used by dividing the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can. But we already know that the 16 ounces of tomatoes is from one can. 

So, if one can has 3 tomatoes, then 16 ounces of tomatoes is 3 tomatoes. To find out how many cans of tomatoes Freda used, we need to find out how many 16 ounces of tomatoes she used. We know that the total sauce is 32 ounces, and the tomatoes are half of that, so the tomatoes are 32 / 2 = 16 ounces. 

Since 16 ounces of tomatoes is 3 tomatoes, then 32 ounces of sauce is 3 x 2 = 6 tomatoes.

"John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner on weekdays. That's 3 glasses a day. There are 5 weekdays, so he drinks 3 x 5 = 15 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, he drinks water with breakfast and lunch, but soda with dinner. So, he drinks 2 glasses of water on each weekend day. There are 2 weekend days, so he drinks 2 x 2 = 4 glasses of water on weekends.

In total, John drinks 15 + 4 = 19 glasses of water in a week.

"To find out how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to know how many 3-mile parts the city is divided into. 

The city is 42 miles across, and it takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles. 

42 miles / 3 miles = 14 parts 

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each part, we need to multiply the number of parts by the time it takes to cover each part.

14 parts * 10 minutes = 140 minutes

The final answer is: 140"
"Poppy places a quarter of the pieces, that's 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces. 

Now, there are 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left. 

Then, her mom places a third of the remaining pieces, that's 750 / 3 = 250 pieces. 

Now, there are 750 - 250 = 500 pieces left.

"To find the inner volume of one box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the length, width, and height of the box. 

Length: 5 - 2 = 3 inches (because there are walls on both sides)
Width: 6 - 2 = 4 inches
Height: 4 - 2 = 2 inches

Now, we multiply the length, width, and height to get the inner volume of one box:
3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches

The final answer is: 72"
"Let's break it down step by step.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 episodes of 1-hour shows. That's 2 x 1 = 2 hours.

On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's call the number of episodes x. So, the total time he watched on Wednesday is 30x minutes. We need to convert this to hours, so it's 30x / 60 = 0.5x hours.

On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. That's 1.5 hours.

On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes. That's 2 x 1 = 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the total time he watched: 2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 + 0.5x.

We know that he watched 7 hours of TV in all. So, we can set up the equation: 5.5 + 0.5x = 7.

Now, let's solve for x. Subtract 5.5 from both sides: 0.5x = 1.5.

Now, divide both sides by 0.5: x = 3.

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to bake twice as many, so he bakes 2x cookies.

But he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually baked 2x + 15 cookies.

Then, he drops 5 cookies, so he has 2x + 15 - 5 cookies left.

We know that he has 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

So Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find out how much gas will cost after the cashback rewards, we need to first find out how much the gas costs before the cashback rewards. 

The gas costs $3.00 a gallon and they bought 10 gallons. 

3.00 * 10 = 30.00

So the gas costs $30.00 before the cashback rewards. 

The app company is offering $.20 cashback per gallon. 

$.20 * 10 = 2.00

So the cashback rewards are $2.00. 

Now we need to subtract the cashback rewards from the total cost of the gas. 

30.00 - 2.00 = 28.00

So the gas will cost $28.00 after the cashback rewards.

Marcell's roll-ups are 3 wide and 14 long, so he has 3 x 14 = 42 roll-ups.

Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 wide and 24 long, so she has 2 x 24 = 48 roll-ups.

Now we add the number of roll-ups they both have: 42 + 48 = 90.

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2: 90 / 2 = 45.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet. 

It took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. This means she rowed 20/10 = 2 sets of 10 feet. 

So, in 16 seconds, the boat took on 2 x 2 = 4 liters of water. 

Now, we need to find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia can row in 64 seconds. We can do this by dividing 64 by 16. 

64 / 16 = 4. 

This means Julia can row 4 sets of 10 feet in 64 seconds. 

So, the boat will take on 4 x 2 = 8 liters of water. 

The final answer is: 8"

"To find the profit, we need to first find out how much Sasha spent on the lumber and how much she gets from selling it.

She bought 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards for $10 each, so she spent 10 x 10 = $100 on those.

She bought 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards for $16 each, so she spent 5 x 16 = $80 on those.

So, in total, she spent 100 + 80 = $180 on the lumber.

Now, let's find out how much she gets from selling the lumber. 

She has 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards. If prices have gone up 50%, that means the new price is 1.5 times the old price. So, the new price for each 2 x 4 x 10 board is 10 x 1.5 = $15.

She has 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards. If prices have gone up 50%, that means the new price is 1.5 times the old price. So, the new price for each 4 x 4 x 10 board is 16 x 1.5 = $24.

She has 10 boards that cost $15 each, so she gets 10 x 15 = $150 from those.

She has 5 boards that cost $24 each, so she gets 5 x 24 = $120 from those.

So, in total, she gets 150 + 120 = $270 from selling the lumber.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the selling price: 270 - 180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"

Okay, I think I get it now. 

Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. This means Lylah's salary was 70% of Adrien's salary. 

Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000. So Lylah's salary four years ago was 70% of $40000, which is 0.7 x 40000 = $28000.

Adrien's salary four years later is 40% higher than his salary four years ago. This means his salary four years later is 140% of his salary four years ago. 140% of $40000 is 1.4 x 40000 = $56000.

Lylah's salary four years later is 40% higher than her salary four years ago. This means her salary four years later is 140% of her salary four years ago. 140% of $28000 is 1.4 x 28000 = $39200.

So, Adrien's salary four years later is $56000 and Lylah's salary four years later is $39200. 

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is $56000 + $39200 = $95200."

"To find the profit, we need to find out how much the hospital makes from the patients and how much it pays the doctors.

First, let's find out how many hours the doctors work in a day.  There are 60 minutes in an hour.  If each patient is seen for 24 minutes, then the doctors see 500 patients / 60 minutes per hour = 8.33 hours.

The hospital pays the doctors $150 an hour.  So, the hospital pays the doctors 8.33 hours * $150 per hour = $1249.50.

Now, let's find out how much the hospital makes from the patients.  Each patient is seen for 24 minutes, which is 24/60 = 0.4 hours.  So, the hospital charges each patient 0.4 hours * $200 per hour = $80.  The hospital sees 500 patients, so it makes 500 * $80 = $40,000.

The hospital's profit is the amount it makes from the patients minus the amount it pays the doctors.  So, the profit is $40,000 - $1249.50 = $38,750.50.

There are 700 bees in total. 

Let's say the number of baby bees is x. 

Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2x. 

And since there are twice as many babies as queens, the number of queens is x/2. 

The total number of bees is the sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens. 

So, we can write the equation: x + 2x + x/2 = 700 

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2. 

This gives us: 2x + 4x + x = 1400 

Combine like terms: 7x = 1400 

Now, divide both sides by 7: x = 200 

Now that we know the number of baby bees is 200, we can find the number of worker bees. 

The number of worker bees is 2x, so the number of worker bees is 2 * 200 = 400

First, we need to find the total cost of the nonfood items. The nonfood items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. 

Light bulbs cost 3 dollars, cups cost 3 dollars, and roach traps cost 4 dollars. 

3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars. 

There is a 10% tax on nonfood items. 10% of 10 dollars is 1 dollar.

Kim has 3 clients now and 5 more coming. So, he has 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. So, for 8 clients, he will need 8 x 2 = 16 bottles of bleach and 8 x 1 = 8 packs of cloths.

Bottles of bleach cost $2 each, so 16 bottles will cost 16 x 2 = $32.
Packs of cloths cost $5 each, so 8 packs will cost 8 x 5 = $40.

Total expenses are $32 + $40 = $72.

Kim's total income is $92. 

Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses. So, profit is $92 - $72 = $20.

Tim's distance is 2 miles. 1 mile is 5280 feet, so Tim's distance is 2 x 5280 = 10560 feet.

Now, we need to find out how long it will take each of them to get home. 

Steve's speed is 440 feet per minute. To find out how long it will take him to get home, we need to divide his distance by his speed. 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes.

Tim's speed is 264 feet per minute. To find out how long it will take him to get home, we need to divide his distance by his speed. 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes.

Since 36 minutes is less than 40 minutes, Steve will win the race. 

To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the time it took the winner to get home from the time it took the loser to get home. 40 - 36 = 4 minutes.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many tires were inflated. 
5 people came by on bicycles, and each bicycle has 2 tires, so that's 5 x 2 = 10 tires. 
3 people came by on tricycles, and each tricycle has 3 tires, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 tires. 
1 person came by on a unicycle, and a unicycle has 1 tire, so that's 1 x 1 = 1 tire. 
So, in total, Shawnda inflated 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires. 

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. To find out how much money Shawnda made, we need to multiply the number of tires by the cost per tire. 
20 x 25 cents = 500 cents. 

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we need to divide 500 by 100 to get the total amount in dollars. 
500 ÷ 100 = 5 dollars.

The final answer is: $5"
"Carl buys 10 packs of cookies. Each pack has 6 cookies. So, he buys 10 x 6 = 60 cookies.

Each cookie costs $0.10. So, 60 cookies cost 60 x $0.10 = $6.

Carl pays with a $10 bill. He gets $10 - $6 = $4 change.

The final answer is: $4"

Dave ate 14 fries. The seagull ate half of that, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. 

Now, there are 14 - 7 = 7 fries left.

"First, we need to find out how long all the rolls are. There are 300 rolls and each roll is 4 inches long. 

300 rolls * 4 inches = 1200 inches

Next, we need to find out how long all the croissants are. There are 120 croissants and each croissant is 6 inches long.

120 croissants * 6 inches = 720 inches

Now, we need to find out how long all the baguettes are. There are 60 baguettes and each baguette is 2 feet long. We need to convert the number of baguettes to inches because we want the total length in inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches
2 feet = 2 * 12 = 24 inches

60 baguettes * 24 inches = 1440 inches

Now, we need to add up the total length of all the baked goods in inches.

1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

Now, we need to convert the total length from inches to feet. 

1 foot = 12 inches
3360 inches / 12 = 280 feet

"Let's break it down. 

The monkeys need 200 bananas every month. So for 2 months, they need 200 x 2 = 400 bananas.

The gorillas need 400 bananas every month. So for 2 months, they need 400 x 2 = 800 bananas.

The baboons need 100 bananas every month. So for 2 months, they need 100 x 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, let's add all the bananas together. 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To find out who wins, we need to calculate how far each person ran. 

Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Since the field is 100 yards long, he runs 100 yards each time. So, he runs 15 x 100 = 1500 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. She does this 34 times. So, she runs 100 + 80 = 180 yards each time. She does this 34 times, so she runs 180 x 34 = 6120 yards.

Now, we need to find out who ran farther. Blake ran 1500 yards and Kelly ran 6120 yards. Kelly ran farther.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we need to subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance. 6120 - 1500 = 4620.

"Let's break it down step by step.

On Monday, the tank has 17 feet of water.

On Tuesday, the tank has 7 feet more water than Monday, so it has 17 + 7 = 24 feet of water.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two thirds of 24, we need to multiply 24 by 2 and then divide by 3.

24 * 2 = 48
48 / 3 = 16

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Anakin caught 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.

Locsin caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.

They caught 19 + 13 = 32 fish in total.

First, I know that the price of the bag of marbles is $20. 

The price increases by 20% every two months. To find 20% of $20, I will multiply 20 by 0.2. 

20 x 0.2 = 4

So, the price increases by $4 every two months. 

Now, I need to find out how many times the price will increase in 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, I will divide 36 by 2. 

36 / 2 = 18

So, the price will increase 18 times in 36 months. 

Now, I will multiply the original price by 18 to find the total increase. 

4 x 18 = 72

Now, I will add the total increase to the original price to find the final price. 

20 + 72 = 92

So, the final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is $92."
"Let's break it down step by step.

We know that one red car costs $4. 
We also know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. 
Since one action figure costs $5, 3 action figures will cost 3 x $5 = $15. 
So, the doll also costs $15.

Now, we know that one red car costs $4. 
There are 5 red cars, so 5 x $4 = $20.

We also know that one action figure costs $5. 
There are 3 action figures, so 3 x $5 = $15.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the toys: 
$20 (red cars) + $15 (doll) + $15 (action figures) = $50.

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age is 2x.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be x + 2 and Seth's age will be 2x + 2.

The sum of their ages in 2 years will be (x + 2) + (2x + 2) = 28.

Combine like terms: 3x + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3x = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 8.

Since Seth is 2x, Seth's age is 2 * 8 = 16.

The hat costs $25.

The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 x $25 = $75.

The pants cost the average of the hat and jacket, so we need to add the hat and jacket costs together and divide by 2. The average cost is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to find out how much she pays each month first. 

Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300, but she wants to pay 50% more than that. 50% of $300 is $150. So, she will pay $300 + $150 = $450 for her student loans each month.

Her credit card's minimum is $200, and she wants to pay 50% more than that. 50% of $200 is $100. So, she will pay $200 + $100 = $300 for her credit card each month.

Her mortgage's minimum is $500, and she wants to pay 50% more than that. 50% of $500 is $250. So, she will pay $500 + $250 = $750 for her mortgage each month.

Now, we need to add up how much she pays each month. $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500. 

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12. $1500 * 12 = $18,000.

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To find out how long it takes Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to add up the time it takes to peel and cut each potato.

It takes 1.5 minutes to peel a potato. 
It takes 5 seconds to cut a potato. 

First, we need to convert 1.5 minutes to seconds. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 1.5 minutes is 1.5 x 60 = 90 seconds.

Now we add the time it takes to peel and cut a potato: 90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds.

Since there are 60 potatoes, we need to multiply the time it takes to peel and cut one potato by 60. 
60 x 95 = 5700 seconds.

To make it easier to understand, we can convert 5700 seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 5700 seconds is 5700 / 60 = 95 minutes.

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"Let's break it down step by step.

They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, they make 20 x $0.50 = $10 per gallon.

They make a profit of $25. To find out how much they made in total, we need to add the profit to the cost of lemons and sugar. Let's call the number of gallons they made ""x"".

The cost of lemons and sugar is $3 + $2 = $5 per gallon. So, the total cost is $5x.

The total amount they made is $10x (from selling lemonade) + $25 (profit).

The total amount they made is also equal to the total cost of lemons and sugar, which is $5x.

So, we can set up the equation: $10x + $25 = $5x.

To solve for x, we need to get x by itself. We can do this by subtracting $5x from both sides of the equation:

$10x - $5x + $25 = $5x - $5x
$5x + $25 = $0

Now, we need to get rid of the $25. We can do this by subtracting $25 from both sides of the equation:

$5x + $25 - $25 = $0 - $25
$5x = -$25

Now, we need to get rid of the negative sign. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by -1:

-$5x = -$25 * -1
-$5x = $25

Now, we need to get x by itself. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -5:

-$5x / -5 = $25 / -5
x = -5

But x can't be negative because they can't make a negative number of gallons. This means that our equation is wrong. Let's go back and look at it again.

The total amount they made is $10x (from selling lemonade) + $25 (profit). The total amount they made is also equal to the total cost of lemons and sugar, which is $5x.

So, we can set up the equation: $10x + $25 = $5x.

But this equation is wrong. The total amount they made is $10x (from selling lemonade) + $25 (profit). The total cost of lemons and sugar is $5x. But they also have to pay for the sugar, which is $2 per gallon. So, the total cost is $5x + $2x = $7x.

So, the correct equation is: $10x + $25 = $7x.

To solve for x, we need to get x by itself. We can do this by subtracting $7x from both sides of the equation:

$10x - $7x + $25 = $7x - $7x
$3x + $25 = $0

Now, we need to get rid of the $25. We can do this by subtracting $25 from both sides of the equation:

$3x + $25 - $25 = $0 - $25
$3x = -$25

Now, we need to get rid of the negative sign. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by -1:

-$3x = -$25 * -1
-$3x = $25

Now, we need to get x by itself. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -3:

-$3x / -3 = $25 / -3
x = -8.33

But x can't be negative because they can't make a negative number of gallons. This means that our equation is still wrong. Let's go back and look at it again.

The total amount they made is $10x (from selling lemonade) + $25 (profit). The total cost of lemons and sugar is $5x. But they also have to pay for the sugar, which is $2 per gallon. So, the total cost is $5x + $2x = $7x. But they also have to pay for the lemons, which is $3 per gallon. So, the total cost is $5x + $2x + $3x = $10x.

So, the correct equation is: $10x + $25 = $10x.

This equation is wrong because it says that $25 is equal to $0. But $25 is not equal to $0. This means that our equation is still wrong. Let's go back and look at it again.

The total amount they made is $10x (from selling lemonade) + $25 (profit). The total cost of lemons and sugar is $5x + $3x = $8x. But they also have to pay for the sugar, which is $2 per gallon. So, the total cost is $8x + $2x = $10x.

So, the correct equation is: $10x + $25 = $10x.

"Let's break it down step by step.

Zaid earns 6000$ per month. 

He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$.

He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$.

Now, let's subtract the rent and car fuel expenses from his salary: 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500$.

He donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity, which is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$.

Now, let's subtract the donation from the remaining amount: 2500 - 1250 = 1250$.

He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so let's subtract these amounts from the remaining amount: 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350$.

So, Zaid will have 350$ left after all these expenses and donations."

"To find out how much more likely it is that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row, we need to find the probability of each event and then subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.

There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is the number of favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) divided by the total number of outcomes (6). 

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the number of favorable outcomes (2, 2, 4, 6) divided by the total number of outcomes (6). 

Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%

Since both probabilities are the same, it is not more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. They are equally likely.

Okay, I think I get it. There are rats and hamsters and rabbits. Rats are in groups of 3 cages. Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. Hamsters are alone, 10 of them, and each gets 5 pieces of straw. There's a pen of rabbits and they get 20 pieces of straw. We know that 160 pieces of straw are used in total for the small rodents. 

Let's start by finding out how many pieces of straw are used for the hamsters. There are 10 hamsters and each gets 5 pieces of straw. So, 10 x 5 = 50 pieces of straw are used for the hamsters.

Now, let's find out how many pieces of straw are used for the rabbits. We know that 20 pieces of straw are used for the rabbits.

Now, let's find out how many pieces of straw are used for the rats. We know that 160 pieces of straw are used in total for the small rodents. We already know that 50 + 20 = 70 pieces of straw are used for the hamsters and the rabbits. So, 160 - 70 = 90 pieces of straw are used for the rats.

We know that there are 3 cages of rats and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. Let's find out how many rats are in each cage. We know that 90 pieces of straw are used for the rats. So, 90 / 6 = 15.

"Let's break it down step by step.

First, they spent $20.25 on 3 tickets. To find out how much they spent on each ticket, we need to divide $20.25 by 3.

$20.25 ÷ 3 = $6.75 per ticket.

They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. So, they spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75 on food.

Now, they went on 2 different rides which cost $33 each. So, the total cost for the rides is $33 x 2 = $66.

Now, let's add up all the costs: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.00.

They agreed to split all the costs evenly among themselves. There are 3 friends, so we need to divide $102.00 by 3.

Now we have 6 white flamingos and 30 pink flamingos. To find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos, we need to subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos. 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is 24."
"Violetta needs 5 crayons and each crayon costs $2. To find out how much she will spend, we need to multiply the number of crayons by the cost of each crayon.

5 crayons * $2 = $10

Violetta has $20. To find out how much change she will get, we need to subtract the cost of the crayons from the money she has.

$20 - $10 = $10

So, Violetta will get $10 as change."
"Let's break it down. 

A pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined. 
So, a pen costs $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50. 

Now, we need to find out how much 8 pens will cost. 
8 pens will cost 8 x $1.50 = $12."
"If each restaurant gets 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants, we need to multiply 2 pounds by 40 restaurants. 

2 x 40 = 80 pounds of carrots will be used.

200 - 80 = 120 pounds of carrots will not be used.

The answer is 120."
"To find the number of kids, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population. 

Total population = 23786
Men = 8417
Women = 9092

First, we add the number of men and women together: 
8417 + 9092 = 17509

Now, we subtract the total number of men and women from the total population: 
23786 - 17509 = 6277

So, there are 6277 kids in Soda."
"Elaine had 20 cards. 
After a month, she collected 3 times that number, so she had 20 x 3 = 60 cards. 
In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than the first month, so she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards. 
Now she has 20 + 60 + 40 = 120 cards. 
In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months, so she collected 2 x (60 + 40) = 2 x 100 = 200 cards. 
Now she has 120 + 200 = 320 cards. 

The final answer is: 320"
"Let's break it down step by step.

Mark edits 1000 sentences each week. 

Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. 

Since Mark edits 1000 sentences for Publisher A, he makes 1000 x 5 = 5000 cents from Publisher A.

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. So, Publisher B pays 2 x 5 = 10 cents per sentence.

Mark also edits 1000 sentences for Publisher B. So, he makes 1000 x 10 = 10000 cents from Publisher B.

To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we add the money he makes from both publishers. 

5000 + 10000 = 15000 cents.

He gets the award on the first day of the year, so he gets the 5000 dollars. 

He works 52 weeks in a year. His new salary is 2100 dollars per week. So he makes 2100 x 52 = 109200 dollars in a year.

He also gets the 5000 dollars from the award. So he makes 109200 + 5000 = 114200 dollars in a year.

"To find out how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we need to do some math.

First, we know that each acre of her farm produces 5 tons of grapes per year. Since she has 10 acres, we multiply 10 acres by 5 tons per acre to find out how many tons of grapes she gets in total.

10 acres * 5 tons per acre = 50 tons of grapes

Next, we know that each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. So, we multiply the total tons of grapes by 2 to find out how many barrels of wine she gets.

50 tons of grapes * 2 barrels per ton = 100 barrels of wine

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

"Let's break it down step by step.

Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, and he used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. There are 7 days in a week, so he ate 7 sandwiches. 

7 sandwiches * 2 slices of cheese per sandwich = 14 slices of cheese for sandwiches.

He ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week. He used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich, so he used 3 slices of cheese per omelet. 

3 omelets * 3 slices of cheese per omelet = 9 slices of cheese for omelets.

He used 8 slices of cheese in the macaroni and cheese dish.

Now, let's add up all the cheese slices: 
14 slices for sandwiches + 9 slices for omelets + 8 slices for macaroni and cheese = 31 slices of cheese.

"Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. That's 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens and 2 bags of red pens. Each bag of blue pens has 9 pens, so 6 bags of blue pens have 6 x 9 = 54 pens. Each bag of red pens has 6 pens, so 2 bags of red pens have 2 x 6 = 12 pens.

Now, Janet has 32 pens (green and yellow) + 54 pens (blue) + 12 pens (red) = 98 pens.

The answer is 98."
"To get an average of 93, we need to find the total score of all six tests and divide it by 6. 

First, let's find the total score of the first five tests. 

89 + 71 = 160
160 + 92 = 252
252 + 100 = 352
352 + 86 = 438

Now, we need to find the total score of all six tests. Since we want an average of 93, we multiply 93 by 6. 

93 x 6 = 558

Now, we subtract the total score of the first five tests from the total score of all six tests to find the score of the sixth test. 

558 - 438 = 120

So, Brinley needs a score of 120 on the sixth test to get an average of 93."
"Micheal rode 25 kilometers 5 times a week for 4 weeks. That's 25 x 5 = 125 kilometers per week. 125 x 4 = 500 kilometers. 

Then he rode 60 kilometers 2 times a week for 3 weeks. That's 60 x 2 = 120 kilometers per week. 120 x 3 = 360 kilometers.

500 + 360 = 860 kilometers. 

The final answer is 860."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40g. We also know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. So, if we let the weight of each candied apple be x, then the weight of each chocolate bar is 2x. 

Since we know the weight of each chocolate bar is 40g, we can set up the equation 2x = 40. To find x, we need to divide both sides by 2. 

x = 40 / 2
x = 20

So, each candied apple weighs 20g. 

Now, we know that Joe has 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. We can find the total weight of the chocolate bars by multiplying the number of chocolate bars by their weight: 25 * 40 = 1000g. 

We can find the total weight of the candied apples by multiplying the number of candied apples by their weight: 80 * 20 = 1600g.

To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples: 1000 + 1600 = 2600g.

"Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that half a dozen plates cost $6000. Since a dozen is 12, half a dozen is 6. So, 6 plates cost $6000.

Now, we need to find the cost of 20 dozen cups. We know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than 6 plates. So, the cost of 6 plates is $6000 and 20 dozen cups is $6000 - $1200 = $4800.

Now, we need to find the cost of 1 dozen cups. Since 20 dozen cups cost $4800, we can divide $4800 by 20 to find the cost of 1 dozen cups. 

$4800 ÷ 20 = $240

Now, we need to find the cost of 1 cup. Since 1 dozen cups is 12, we can divide $240 by 12 to find the cost of 1 cup.

$240 ÷ 12 = $20

"Sara wants a jacket for $30 and 2 pairs of shoes for $20 each. That's $30 + $40 = $70 total for the shoes and jacket.

She already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn. 

She needs $70 - $10 = $60 more to buy the jacket and shoes.

She earns $5 each time she babysits, so she can babysit 12 times to earn $60 (12 x $5 = $60). But she also earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so she can mow the lawn 15 times to earn $60 (15 x $4 = $60).

Since she can mow the lawn 15 times to earn $60, she must mow the lawn 15 times.

"Let's say the number of red chickens is x. Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is x + 2.

Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs from red chickens is 3x.

White chickens produce 5 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs from white chickens is 5(x + 2).

Jerry collects 42 eggs a day, so we can set up the equation:

3x + 5(x + 2) = 42

To solve for x, we need to simplify the equation:

3x + 5x + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8x + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8x = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

x = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens."
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to know how far he walks and how fast he walks. 

The park is a rectangle, so we need to find the distance around it. The distance around a rectangle is called the perimeter. To find the perimeter, we add up all the sides. 

The park is 1.5 miles by 6 miles, so the perimeter is 1.5 + 1.5 + 6 + 6 = 15 miles.

Now we know Gary walks 15 miles and he walks at 3 miles/hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we need to divide the distance by the speed. 

15 miles / 3 miles/hour = 5 hours.

"Let's say the small pool has x gallons of water. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had 2x gallons of water. 

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, in 4 minutes, each pool lost 4 gallons. So, the small pool now has x - 4 gallons and the big pool now has 2x - 4 gallons.

We know that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we can write an equation:

2x - 4 = 4(x - 4)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 4 = 4x - 16

Add 4 to both sides:

2x = 4x - 12

Subtract 4x from both sides:

-2x = -12

Divide both sides by -2:

x = 6

So, the small pool had 6 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since it leaks at 4 gallons/minute, in 4 minutes, it lost 4 gallons. 

The small pool now has 6 - 4 = 2 gallons of water."

This is the total amount she will pay. But she also promised to return the $2000 she borrowed, plus an additional 10% of the amount. 

10% of $2000 is $200. 

So, she will return $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Now, we need to find out how much she will have paid in total, including the extra $200. 

$1980 + $200 = $2180

Now, we need to find out how much she will have left. 

$2200 (the amount she will return) - $2180 (the amount she will pay) = $20

"Let's break it down step by step.

Harriet is 21 years old now. 

Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 times Harriet's age. 
Zack's age = 2 x 21 = 42 years old.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet. 
Adrian's age = 3 x 21 = 63 years old.

In three years, Harriet's age will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
In three years, Zack's age will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old.
In three years, Adrian's age will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.

To find the average age of the three in three years, we need to add their ages and divide by 3.
Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Half of 68 is 34. 
10 more than 34 is 44. 
So Yuri scored 44 points. 

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. 
17 more than 68 is 85. 
So Brianna scored 85 points. 

We know that the total points scored by the four students is 251. 
We know that Naomi scored 68 points, Yuri scored 44 points, and Brianna scored 85 points. 
Let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna.

Now, there are 1000 - 300 = 700 students left.

Then, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. 
3/5 of 700 is (3/5) x 700 = 420 students.

Now, there are 700 - 420 = 280 students left.

The rest of the students went out through exit C, which is 280 students.

The final answer is: 280"
"Let's break it down step by step.

We know John has 54 candies. 

John has twice as many candies as Robert, so Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we need to subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has. 

54 (John's candies) - 33 (James' candies) = 21.

The final answer is: 21"
"Dolly has 2 books. 
Pandora has 1 book. 

Dolly will read her 2 books and Pandora's 1 book. That's 3 books. 
Pandora will read her 1 book and Dolly's 2 books. That's 3 books. 

So, Dolly will read 3 books and Pandora will read 3 books. 
Together, they will read 3 + 3 = 6 books. 

The final answer is 6."
"Mike was pen pals with 5 people. He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he is left with 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals.

Each of his 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 letters a week. 

Since each letter is 5 pages long, he gets 6 x 5 = 30 pages to read a week.

He responds to each letter, so he writes 30 pages a week too.

He can write 1 page every 6 minutes, so to write 30 pages, it takes him 30 x 6 = 180 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 180 minutes is 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

The answer is 3."
"Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day. There are 30 days in the month, so he has 15 * 30 = 450 minutes of calls with his boss.

He also had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. So, in total, he used 450 + 300 = 750 minutes.

He started with 1000 minutes. So, he has 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes left.

"Griffin had 24 fries. Kyle took 5 fries. 

So, Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 5 x 2 = 10 fries.

Now, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.

Ginger gave Griffin some fries, and then Colby took 3 less than Kyle's fries. Kyle took 5 fries, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.

Griffin had 9 fries left after Billy took his fries, and then Griffin had 9 - 2 = 7 fries left after Colby took his fries.

Griffin had 27 fries in the end. So, Ginger gave Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's say the number of fish in each aquarium is x. 

Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

This difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, so we can write an equation:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2 again:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

7"
"To find out how much Jean paid, we need to do some math.

First, we need to find out how many hours the makeup artist works in total. She works 6 hours a day, 4 times a week, for 5 weeks. 

6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Now, we need to find out how much she charges for 120 hours. She charges $250 an hour.

120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

After the movie is done, she gives Jean a 10% discount. To find out the discount, we need to find 10% of $30,000.

10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000

Now, we need to subtract the discount from the total cost.

$30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

So, Jean paid $27,000."
"Let's add up all the money Isabelle spent. 

$12 + $43 = $55
$55 + $15 = $70
$70 + $4 = $74
$74 + $22 = $96

Now, we need to split the total cost of $96 evenly among 3 people (Isabelle and her 2 parents). 

$96 / 3 = $32

So each person paid $32."
"The chef bought 4 bags of onions. Each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight of onions is 4 x 50 = 200 pounds. 

A pound of onions cost $1.50. So, the total cost of onions is 200 x $1.50 = $300. 

The chef spent $300."
"Let's break it down step by step.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate 5 x 4 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate 13 x 2 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies Sue and her sister ate. Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies. Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 x 200 = 9200 calories. Her sister consumed 18 x 200 = 3600 calories.

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to subtract the calories her sister consumed from the calories Sue consumed. 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

The final answer is: 5600"
"Let's break it down step by step.

We know that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls. This means that the total number of boys and girls in the school is equal.

Since there are 3 classes, and each class has 20 students, the total number of students in the school is 3 x 20 = 60.

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 x 60 = 30.

Now, we know that there are 27 girls in the first two classes, so the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% boys, the total number of boys in the school is also 30.

We know that the first two classes have a total of 20 x 2 = 40 students. Since there are 30 students in total, the number of students in the third class is 60 - 40 = 20.

Since there are 3 girls in the third class, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

"Let's break it down step by step.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's say the number of cougars he killed today is x. Then, the number of wolves he killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars he killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars he killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12. To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 12 / 3 = 4.

So, the number of cougars he killed today is 12 and the number of wolves he killed today is 3x = 3 * 4 = 12.

To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we add the number of animals he killed last night and today: 10 + 15 + 12 + 12 = 49.

Mitchel went down the slide 30 times. 
Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. 
30% of 30 is 9, so Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne. 
So, Robert went down 4 x 21 = 84 times.

The answer is 84."
"Mr. Sylas had 10 stalls with 20 cows each. That's 10 x 20 = 200 cows. 

He bought 40 more cows. Now he has 200 + 40 = 240 cows.

He puts the 40 new cows into the 10 stalls. So each stall now has 20 + 4 = 24 cows.

He has 8 of the stalls. So we need to find out how many cows are in 8 stalls. 8 x 24 = 192."
"Let's count the money. 

First, we count the pennies. 100 pennies is 100 x 0.01 = 1 dollar. 

Next, we count the nickels. 40 nickels is 40 x 0.05 = 2 dollars.

Then, we count the dimes. 20 dimes is 20 x 0.10 = 2 dollars.

Lastly, we count the dollar bills. 40 dollar bills is 40 x 1 = 40 dollars.

Now, we add all the money together. 1 + 2 + 2 + 40 = 45 dollars.

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to know how many 10-foot sections it has. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to find the number of sections. 

200 / 10 = 20

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section.

20 * 400 = 8000

Now, we need to find 30% of the total weight that the termites ate. To do this, we multiply the total weight by 0.3 (which is the same as 30%).

8000 * 0.3 = 2400

The termites ate 2400 pounds of the redwood. To find the weight of the redwood left, we subtract the weight eaten by the termites from the total weight.

"Let's break it down step by step.

Andrea has 52 apples. 

Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, let's count the total number of fruits. Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, and Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas. 

Total number of fruits = (Andrea's apples + Andrea's bananas) + (Jamal's apples + Jamal's bananas)

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to know how many cookies she is making in total. Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. 

36 + 30 = 66 cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies, and a dozen is 12 cookies, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies Carla is making. 

66 / 12 = 5.5

Since 5.5 dozens is not possible, we can say Carla is making 5 full dozens and 6 extra cookies. 

5 dozens = 5 x 12 = 60 cookies
60 + 6 = 66 cookies

Now we know Carla is making 66 cookies. To find out how many cups of flour she needs, we need to divide the total number of cookies by 12.

66 / 12 = 5.5

Since we can't buy half a cup of flour, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So Carla will need 6 cups of flour."

"Let's break it down step by step.

The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches. 

The collar takes a tenth of that number of stitches, so it takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 2 x 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

The whole sweater is 1800 stitches, so the two sleeves take 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

The answer is 315."

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 x 54 = 108 lines. But only a third of them are Sean's lines, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of them are Sean's lines, so he has 4/5 x 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the first scene, the lines from the second scene, and the lines from the song: 36 + 48 + 54 = 138.

Let's say Mico's age is x and Marco's age is 20 - x. 

In 10 years, Mico's age will be x + 10 and Marco's age will be (20 - x) + 10. 

We can simplify that to x + 10 and 30 - x. 

Now, we need to add those two numbers together: (x + 10) + (30 - x) = 40.

"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to find out how much space the topaz gemstones take up and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace. 

Each topaz gemstone is one inch long, and there are 8 of them. So, the topaz gemstones take up 8 inches of space. 

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. 

Now, we need to find out how much space the sterling silver beads take up. We can do this by subtracting the space taken up by the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace. 

25 (total length) - 8 (space taken up by topaz gemstones) = 17 inches

Since each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, we need to find out how many one-quarter inch pieces fit into 17 inches. 

To do this, we can divide 17 by 0.25 (one-quarter of an inch). 

17 ÷ 0.25 = 68

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."

Now, we need to add the total number of stories they wrote in the first week and the second week to get the total number of stories they wrote altogether. 

120 + 240 = 360 stories

The final answer is: 360"

"Let's count the stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars. 3 x 8 = 24 stars.

Now, let's count the stars in the 2 rows of 6 stars. 2 x 6 = 12 stars.

We know there are 76 stars in total. We already counted 24 + 12 = 36 stars. 

76 - 36 = 40 stars left. 

Since each row has 5 stars, we can divide 40 by 5 to find the number of rows of 5 stars. 40 / 5 = 8.

The answer is 8."
"To find out how many trucks are needed, we need to know how much weight all the flagstones weigh. 

First, we need to find out how much all the flagstones weigh. We know each flagstone weighs 75 pounds and there are 80 flagstones. 

So, 80 flagstones * 75 pounds = 6000 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many trucks are needed to carry 6000 pounds. Each truck can carry 2000 pounds. 

To find out how many trucks are needed, we divide the total weight by the weight each truck can carry. 

6000 pounds / 2000 pounds = 3.

So, 3 trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: 3"
"The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane. 

Speed of the car in the fast lane = 60 miles/hour
Speed of the car in the slow lane = 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour

The car in the fast lane traveled 480 miles. 

Time taken by the car in the fast lane = Distance / Speed
Time taken by the car in the fast lane = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, it will take twice the time to cover the same distance.

Time taken by the car in the slow lane = 2 * Time taken by the car in the fast lane
Time taken by the car in the slow lane = 2 * 8 hours = 16 hours

The answer is 16."
"Let's break it down step by step.

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

They have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, so the total number of medals given out is 10 times more than what they have. Let's call the total number of medals given out ""x"". Then, 10x - 39 = x.

To find x, we need to add 39 to both sides of the equation: 10x = x + 39.

Now, we need to get x by itself. We can do this by subtracting x from both sides: 10x - x = 39.

This simplifies to 9x = 39.

Now, we need to divide both sides by 9 to find x: x = 39 / 9.

x = 4.33

But we can't have a fraction of a medal, so we'll round up to the nearest whole number."
"First, we need to find out how many chocolate bars there are in total. There are 8 packets of chocolate bars and each packet has 5 chocolate bars. 

8 packets * 5 chocolate bars = 40 chocolate bars

Now, 4 adults will get 6 chocolate bars each. 

4 adults * 6 chocolate bars = 24 chocolate bars

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. 

40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

Now, we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars among 8 children. 

16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. That's 3 hours. 

3 hours is 180 minutes. 

She pauses for half an hour, which is 30 minutes. 

So, she works for 180 - 30 = 150 minutes. 

She earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10 minutes are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10. 

150 / 10 = 15 

So, she earns $5 for 15 times. 

5 * 15 = 75

Mike has 21 points after 3 rounds. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, let's see who gets an extra point in the fourth round. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point. Now Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point. Jim still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point. Now Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

"To find out how many days a bag of rice will last, we need to know how much rice is eaten per day. 

5 people eat rice for 2 meals a day, so that's 5 x 2 = 10 people eating rice per day. 

Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal, so 10 people eat 10 x 0.2 = 2 kg of rice per day.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount eaten per day (2 kg).

42 kg / 2 kg per day = 21 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide 21 days by 7 to find out how many weeks the rice will last.

21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks

So, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he didn't sell any bread on those days. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend. 

On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates. 
On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates. 
On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

To find out how many crates he sold in total, we add the crates he sold each day: 
20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Since Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, he missed 2 days. A week has 7 days, so he had 5 days to sell bread. 

His target was 120 crates for the week, but he only had 5 days to sell them. To find out how many crates he needed to sell each day to reach his target, we divide 120 by 5: 
120 / 5 = 24 crates per day

Now, let's find out how many crates he actually sold per day: 
65 crates / 5 days = 13 crates per day

To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he sold per day from the number of crates he needed to sell per day: 
24 (target) - 13 (actual) = 11 crates

"To find out how much John pays a year for driving, we need to find out how much he pays per day, then multiply it by the number of days he goes to work in a year.

First, let's find out how many miles he drives in a day. He goes to work 30 miles away and comes back, so that's 30 + 30 = 60 miles per day.

He gets charged $2 per mile, so he pays 60 x $2 = $120 per day.

He goes to work 5 days a week, so he pays 5 x $120 = $600 per week.

There are 50 weeks in a year, so he pays 50 x $600 = $30,000 per year.

But he also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he pays 12 x $150 = $1,800 per year.

So, the total amount he pays a year for driving is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

Elise sold 45 books this year. 

Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, she sold 2 x 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We know that there are 50 unsold books left now. So, the total number of books she sold in 3 years is 250 - 50 = 200.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books this year. So, the number of books she sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65.

Each book sells at 20$. So, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 x 20 = 1300.

So, 80/100 * 20 = 16 people. 

This means John beats 16 people. 

Since John arm wrestles 20 people, and he beats 16, he must lose to the rest.

First, let's find out how much 2 tubs of ice cream will cost. 
2 tubs of ice cream will cost 2 x $11 = $22.

Next, let's find out how much 4 packets of milk will cost. 
The original price of a packet of milk is not given, but we know that it was sold at a discount of $0.5. So, the price of a packet of milk is $1. 
4 packets of milk will cost 4 x $1 = $4.

Now, let's add the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk. 
$22 + $4 = $26.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is not given, but we know that a tub of ice cream costs $13 and a packet of milk costs $1. 
2 tubs of ice cream will cost 2 x $13 = $26.
4 packets of milk will cost 4 x $1 = $4.
The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is $26 + $4 = $30.

3. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit.
Cost of a business suit is $100. 
5 x 100 = 500 dollars. 
500 + 700 = 1200 dollars for the flight ticket.

4. Total money spent so far is 600 + 150 + 1200 = 1950 dollars.

5. Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip. 
He has $6000 initially. 
So, he will spend 6000 - 2000 = 4000 dollars.

Let's say the number of players on the defense is x.

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is x/2.

The total number of players is 105, so we can write an equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. 1/4 of 40 is 10. So, 10 people left the party.

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. This means that 25 - 22 = 3 men left the party.

Since 10 people left the party in total, and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils. We know that 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils give a total of 26 pencils. 

To find out how many pencils are in each box, we need to subtract the loose pencils from the total number of pencils. 

26 (total pencils) - 2 (loose pencils) = 24 pencils

Now we know that 3 boxes have 24 pencils. To find out how many pencils are in each box, we need to divide 24 by 3.

24 / 3 = 8 pencils per box

Now we know that each box has 8 pencils. We also know that Jam has 3 boxes and Meg has 46 pencils. 

To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, we need to add the number of pencils Jam has (3 boxes * 8 pencils per box = 24 pencils) and Meg's pencils (46 pencils). 

24 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 70 pencils

Now we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store 70 pencils. We know that each box has 8 pencils. 

70 (total pencils) / 8 (pencils per box) = 8.75

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to know how many percentage points it needs to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs to charge 100% - 60% = 40% more.

Since it charges 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we need to find out how many 3-minute intervals are in 40%. 

To do this, we divide 40 by 1 (since it charges 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes). 

40 / 1 = 40

So, it needs 40 intervals of 3 minutes each to charge 40%. 

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by the time each interval takes: 
40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
120 / 60 = 2

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final answer is: 2"
"Erin has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more. So now Erin has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops. Then Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. So Erin has 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops left.

"The customer got $1 off for every $20 they spent last time, and they spent $80. So they got 80 / 20 = 4 dollars off. 

This shopping trip, they spent $43 and got a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off. The rewards they got last time was 4 dollars, so the coupon took 2 x 4 = 8 dollars off. 

So they got 4 dollars off from the rewards and 8 dollars off from the coupon. That's 4 + 8 = 12 dollars off. 

They spent 43 dollars, but got 12 dollars off. So they paid 43 - 12 = 31 dollars.

Job A: 
- Pay per hour: $15
- Hours worked per year: 2000
- Total pay per year: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax: 20% of $30,000 = 0.2 * $30,000 = $6,000
- Net pay per year: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B: 
- Pay per year: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net pay before tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax: 10% of $36,000 = 0.1 * $36,000 = $3,600
- Net pay per year: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, let's compare the net pay of both jobs. Job B has a higher net pay rate than Job A.

To find out how much more money Nick will make at Job B compared to Job A, we need to subtract the net pay of Job A from the net pay of Job B.

$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

The final answer is: $8,400"

Cozy Homes' offer: 
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two offers. 
Cost difference = Total cost of Furniture United's offer - Total cost of Cozy Homes' offer
Cost difference = $3,450 - $3,350
Cost difference = $100

"To find out how many guns each person would have if they share equally, we need to add up all the guns first. 

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. 

8 + 10 = 18
18 + 1 = 19
19 + 5 = 24

Now we know they have 24 guns in total. To find out how many guns each person would have if they share equally, we need to divide 24 by 4 (because there are 4 people).

24 ÷ 4 = 6

So each person would have 6 guns."
"To find out how much sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the total sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge separately, then add them together.

For the suckers, Mason needs 30 ounces per batch. He needs 8 batches, so we multiply 30 by 8.

30 x 8 = 240

For the fudge, Mason needs 70 ounces per batch. He needs 1 batch, so we multiply 70 by 1.

70 x 1 = 70

Now, we add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge together.

240 + 70 = 310

So, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar."
"Let's break it down step by step.

Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each. So, the total cost is 8 x 8 = 64 dollars.

The stock price increases 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we need to add 50% of the original price to the original price. 50% of 8 is 4. So, the new price is 8 + 4 = 12 dollars.

Now, Maria has 8 shares worth 12 dollars each. So, the total value is 8 x 12 = 96 dollars.

The stock price decreases 25% in the second year. To find the new price, we need to subtract 25% of the current price from the current price. 25% of 12 is 3. So, the new price is 12 - 3 = 9 dollars.

Now, Maria has 8 shares worth 9 dollars each. So, the total value is 8 x 9 = 72 dollars.

The final value of all Maria's shares is 72."

"Let's say the number of students in the two equal groups is x. 

Since the last group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students is 200, so we can write an equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. 

The number of students in the smallest group is x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60.

"Let's say the number of cows is x. Then the number of chickens is 2x because Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows.

We know that the total number of animals is 60. So, x + 2x = 60. 

Combine like terms: 3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3: x = 20

So, the number of cows is 20 and the number of chickens is 2x = 2 * 20 = 40.

Cows have 4 legs and chickens have 2 legs. 

The total number of legs of cows is 20 * 4 = 80. 
The total number of legs of chickens is 40 * 2 = 80.

The total number of legs of all animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

2. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the animals and the container:

Now, we need to subtract the discount from the original price of each shirt. $30 - $12 = $18. 

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we need to multiply the price of one shirt by 2. $18 x 2 = $36.

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

They sold 10 tractors a day and made $100 per tractor. So, they made 10 x 100 = 1000 dollars per day.

Now, they sell 5 silos a day and make $220 per silo. So, they make 5 x 220 = 1100 dollars per day.

To find the percentage more, we need to find the difference between the new and old money. 1100 - 1000 = 100 dollars.

Then, we need to divide the difference by the old money and multiply by 100 to get the percentage. (100 / 1000) x 100 = 10%.

John spent 6 hours boating. He spent half that time swimming, so he spent 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming.

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he watched 3 * 2 = 6 hours of shows.

He spent 30% of his time watching shows. Let's call the total time he spent x. Then 30% of x is 6 hours. We can write this as 0.3x = 6.

To find x, we divide both sides by 0.3: x = 6 / 0.3 = 20.

So John spent a total of 20 hours on vacation.

He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. We can find the time he spent sightseeing by multiplying 20 by 0.4: 20 * 0.4 = 8.

Morgan wants to play mini-golf, so that will cost $5. 
She also wants to have $5 in arcade tokens, so that's another $5. 
She wants to ride the go-karts twice, and that will cost 2 x $10 = $20. 

So, the total cost for Morgan is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30. 

Now, we need to subtract the cost of Morgan's activities from her budget. 
$90 - $30 = $60. 

This is the amount of money left for her friends. 
Since each friend will get a round of mini-golf, $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice, the cost per friend is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30. 

To find out how many friends she can invite, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost per friend. 
$60 ÷ $30 = 2. 

So, Morgan can invite 2 friends."

He bought 40 gumballs for $.05 each, so he spent 40 * 0.05 = 2 dollars on gumballs.

We know that (10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2. 

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2 to get 10 - 1.5x = 4.

Now, we add 1.5x to both sides to get 10 = 4 + 1.5x.

Then, we subtract 4 from both sides to get 6 = 1.5x.

Finally, we divide both sides by 1.5 to get x = 4.

The train goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than that combined distance to go from the third city to the first city. 

First, we need to find the combined distance from the first city to the second city and the second city to the third city. 
75 + 100 = 175 miles

Now, we need to find the distance from the third city to the first city, which is 50 miles less than the combined distance. 
175 - 50 = 125 miles

So, the total distance the train travels in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

The train does this trip 3 times a day. 
300 * 3 = 900 miles per day

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. 
To find out how many days it goes between services, we need to divide the total miles it can travel before service by the miles it travels per day.

So, a bed for a collie takes 5 pounds of stuffing. 

Now, we need to find out how much stuffing is needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 

4 chihuahua beds need 4 x 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing. 
3 collie beds need 3 x 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

In total, Mark needs 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing.

Distance back home = 240 miles
Speed back home = 80 mph
Time taken to drive back home = Distance / Speed
Time taken to drive back home = 240 miles / 80 mph
Time taken to drive back home = 3 hours

44 seniors will get picture frames, so that will cost 44 x $24 = $1056.

2 seniors will get pins that cost $5 each, so that will cost 2 x $5 = $10.

11 seniors are officers and they will get cords that cost $12 each, so that will cost 11 x $12 = $132.

Now, let's add up the total number of pairs sold: 14 + 28 + 14 = 56 pairs of shoes.

But, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit, so we need to subtract 6 from the total number of pairs sold: 56 - 6 = 50 pairs of shoes.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we need to multiply the number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold: 50 x 2 = 100 shoes.

"To find the amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to find out how much the faulty pieces cost and subtract that from the total amount.

First, we find the cost of the faulty pieces. 40% of $400000 is the cost of the faulty pieces. 

To find 40% of $400000, we multiply $400000 by 0.4 (since 40% is the same as 40/100 or 0.4).

$400000 * 0.4 = $160000

So, the faulty pieces cost $160000. 

Now, we subtract the cost of the faulty pieces from the total amount to find the cost of the functioning pieces.

She gets 1 kg of milk from 15 sheep, so that's 15 x 1 = 15 kg. 

She gets 2 kg of milk from the other 15 sheep, so that's 15 x 2 = 30 kg. 

15 + 30 = 45 kg. 

The answer is 45."
"Mrs. Sherman started with a dozen bread rolls. A dozen is 12. 

She gave 1 roll to each of her 6 children. So, she gave 6 rolls to the children. 

Now, she has 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left. 

She broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. So, she broke 6 rolls into 8 pieces each. 

6 rolls * 8 pieces = 48 pieces. 

The answer is 48."
"First, we find out how many pupils like blue. There are 40 pupils in total and half of them like blue. 

40 / 2 = 20 pupils like blue.

Now, we find out how many pupils are left. 

40 - 20 = 20 pupils are left.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. 

20 / 4 = 5 pupils like green.

Now, we find out how many pupils like yellow. 

20 - 5 = 15 pupils like yellow.

The answer is 15."
"Let's break it down step by step.

On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples she picked and got $56. Since she sells apples for $4 each, we can find out how many apples she picked on Monday by dividing $56 by $4.

$56 ÷ $4 = 14 apples

So, Lucy picked 14 apples on Monday.

On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which is 2 x 12 = 24 apples.

Now, let's add up the number of apples she picked over the three days:

14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples

The final answer is: 50"
"Lindsay washes 10 pairs of socks. Since a pair has 2 socks, she washes 10 x 2 = 20 socks. 

She also washes 15 loose socks. 

So, in total, Lindsay washes 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

There were 50 socks to start with. So, Lindsay has washed 35 socks. 

To find out how many socks she has missed, we need to subtract the number of socks she washed from the total number of socks. 

50 - 35 = 15

So, Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"Let's count the cookies Rachel has. 

Rachel had 23 cookies. 
Janet gave her 42 cookies. 
So now Rachel has 23 + 42 = 65 cookies.

So now Rachel has 65 - 44 = 21 cookies.

The answer is 21."
"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest she has to pay and then divide it by the number of months.

The total amount she borrowed is $3,650. The interest rate is 10%, which is 10/100 or 0.1.

The total interest she has to pay is 3,650 x 0.1 = $365.

Since she has to pay the loan for 5 months, we need to divide the total interest by 5 to find out how much she has to pay per month.

365 / 5 = 73.

So, Karan has to pay $73 per month.

The final answer is: $73"
"Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. 

14 kilometers per hour * 8 hours = 112 kilometers

Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours. To find out how far Chloe hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time.

9 kilometers per hour * 5 hours = 45 kilometers

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we need to subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked.

112 kilometers - 45 kilometers = 67 kilometers

The answer is 67."
"Let's break it down step by step.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. 

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 x 50 = 100 silver pesos.

Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add up all the pesos they have together. 

Axel's silver pesos: 50
Axel's gold pesos: 80
Anna's silver pesos: 100
Anna's gold pesos: 120

Total silver pesos: 50 + 100 = 150
Total gold pesos: 80 + 120 = 200

"To find out how much profit Millie will make per hour, we need to know how much money she makes per hour and how much she spends per hour.

First, let's find out how much money Millie makes per hour. She sells 4 cups of lemonade per hour and each cup costs $1. So, she makes 4 x $1 = $4 per hour.

Now, let's find out how much money Millie makes in total. She makes 3 pitchers of lemonade and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, she makes 3 x 12 = 36 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup for $1, so she makes 36 x $1 = $36 in total.

Now, let's find out how much money Millie spends per hour. She spends $18 to buy supplies and she makes $4 per hour. So, she makes $4 per hour and spends $18 in total. To find out how much she spends per hour, we need to divide $18 by the number of hours she works. We don't know how many hours she works, but we can find out how many hours she works by dividing the total amount of lemonade she makes by the number of cups she sells per hour. She makes 36 cups of lemonade and sells 4 cups per hour, so she works 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

Now, we can find out how much she spends per hour by dividing $18 by 9 hours. $18 / 9 = $2 per hour.

Now, let's find out how much profit Millie makes per hour. She makes $4 per hour and spends $2 per hour, so she makes a profit of $4 - $2 = $2 per hour.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's say Mr. Ruther had x hectares of land at first. 

He sold 3/5 of his land, so he has 2/5 of his land left. 

We know that 2/5 of his land is 12.8 hectares. 

To find x, we need to solve the equation: (2/5)x = 12.8

To do this, we can multiply both sides by 5/2 to get x = 12.8 * (5/2)

x = 32

So Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

32"
"First, we find out how many girls are in the choir. 50% of 52 is 26 girls. 

Then, half of the girls can't make it to the show, so 26 / 2 = 13 girls can't make it. 

So, 26 - 13 = 13 girls can make it to the show.

The 3 teachers are also singing, so we add 3 to the number of girls. 13 + 3 = 16.

The answer is 16."

The final answer is 88."
"David buys a ride bracelet for $30.  Dasha buys 9 tickets for 9 rides at $2 per ticket, so that's 9 x 2 = 18 dollars. 

David and Dasha ride all 9 rides together, so they both get the same number of rides.  David already has a ride bracelet, so he doesn't need to buy any more tickets.  Dasha needs to buy 9 tickets, which costs 18 dollars. 

David pays $30 for the ride bracelet, and Dasha pays $18 for the tickets.  To find out how much money David saves, we need to subtract Dasha's cost from David's cost.  So, 30 - 18 = 12. 

The answer is 12."
"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to know how many gifts she has in total and divide the total ribbon by the number of gifts.

She has 144 inches of ribbon. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we need to divide 144 by 12.

144 ÷ 12 = 12

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"Let's break it down. 

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. 

Let's say the number of popsicles Betty has is 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has is 6x. 

We know that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. So, 5x + 6x = 165. 

Combine the x's: 11x = 165. 

Now, divide both sides by 11: x = 15. 

So, Betty has 5x = 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles. 

And Sam has 6x = 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles. 

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"

First, we know Tim gets Netflix for $10 a month. 

Hulu and Disney Plus cost $10 each, so together they cost $20. 

If he bundles them, he saves 20% of $20. 20% of $20 is 0.2 x 20 = $4. 

So, he saves $4 by bundling. 

Now, he pays $10 for Netflix and $16 for the bundled Hulu and Disney Plus. That's $26. 

He used to pay $60 for cable. 

So, he saves $60 - $26 = $34. 

The answer is $34."
"To find the total time, we need to add the time she spent writing, recording, and editing. 

She spent 4 hours writing. 
She spent half of 4 hours recording, which is 4 / 2 = 2 hours. 
She spent 90 minutes editing. We need to convert 90 minutes to hours, which is 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours. 

Now, let's add the time: 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours.

To find the percentage of time she spent editing, we need to divide the time she spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100. 

(1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20

"To find out how many books Wendy needs, we need to first find out how many books are in the shelving system. 

There are 6 rows and 6 columns, so we multiply 6 by 6 to find the total number of books. 

6 x 6 = 36

Now, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books. Double the number of books is 2 x 36 = 72. 

Then, we add 20 to 72. 

72 + 20 = 92

So, Wendy needs 92 books to complete her task.

"Mark has $50 in his bank account. He earns $10 per day at his work. He wants to buy a bike that costs $300. 

To find out how many days Mark has to save his money, we need to subtract the money he already has from the price of the bike, then divide that by how much he earns per day.

First, we subtract $50 from $300. $300 - $50 = $250. 

Then, we divide $250 by $10. $250 ÷ $10 = 25.

So, Mark has to save his money for 25 days."
"To find the number of millipedes, we need to find 1/3rd of the number of spiders. 

1/3rd of 90 is 90 / 3 = 30 millipedes.

The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. 
So, 2 * 30 = 60, and 60 - 12 = 48 stink bugs.

Now, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together. 
90 + 30 + 48 = 168

"Mark needs 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk for the normal recipe. Since he's making a quadruple batch, he needs 3 x 4 = 12 cups of flour and 1 x 4 = 4 cups of milk.

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs to buy 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark needs to buy 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

Mark has to buy 6 - 2 = 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk."
"I think I know this. 

First, I need to find out how much energy the air conditioner uses in one day. If it uses 900 watts per hour and it's used for 8 hours, then it uses 900 x 8 = 7200 watts per day. 

Now, I need to find out how much energy it uses in 30 days. 7200 watts per day x 30 days = 216,000 watts. 

But the question asks for kilowatts, not watts. I think I know what that is. Kilowatts are like watts, but bigger. There are 1000 watts in a kilowatt. So, I need to divide 216,000 by 1000 to get kilowatts. 

216,000 ÷ 1000 = 216 kilowatts.

Now, if Mel uses the air conditioner for 3 hours a day instead of 8 hours, I need to find out how much energy it uses in one day. 900 watts per hour x 3 hours = 2700 watts per day.

Now, I need to find out how much energy it uses in 30 days. 2700 watts per day x 30 days = 81,000 watts. 

Now, I need to convert this to kilowatts. 81,000 ÷ 1000 = 81 kilowatts.

Now, I need to find out how much energy Mel saves. He used 216 kilowatts when he used the air conditioner for 8 hours a day, and he uses 81 kilowatts when he uses it for 3 hours a day. So, he saves 216 - 81 = 135 kilowatts.

"To make enough sandwiches for 20 people, we need to know how many sandwiches we need. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide 20 by 4.

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. So we need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of meat will cost:
5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of cheese will cost:
5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the meat and the cheese:

"Let's break it down step by step.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week and was paid $15 per hour. So, the total amount paid to each employee in May is 40 hours * $15 per hour = $600.

Since there are 4 weeks in May, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400.

The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 employees * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of 40 employees left, so 40 * 1/4 = 10 employees left. The remaining employees are 40 - 10 = 30 employees.

The 30 employees who stayed worked 40 hours a week and were paid $15 per hour. So, the total amount paid to each employee in June is 40 hours * $15 per hour = $600.

Since there are 4 weeks in June, the total amount paid to each employee in June is $600 * 4 = $2400.

The total amount paid to the 30 employees in June is 30 employees * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount paid to all employees in both months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

Sally started with $10.

She bought 2 pounds of taffy. The first pound costs $3, and the second pound is half off, so it costs $1.50. So, the total cost of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets for $0.25 each. The total cost of magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1. So, the total cost of seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the things she bought: $4.50 (taffy) + $2.50 (seashells and magnets) = $7.

To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to subtract the total cost from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

"First, Tim buys a package of fireworks worth $400 and another pack worth twice that much. Twice of 400 is 400 x 2 = 800. So, the total cost of the two packs of fireworks is 400 + 800 = 1200.

Then, he gets a 20% discount on them. 20% of 1200 is 0.2 x 1200 = 240. So, the discount is $240.

Now, we need to subtract the discount from the total cost of the fireworks. 1200 - 240 = 960.

Then, he buys a finale firework that costs $150. So, we need to add 150 to the total cost of the fireworks. 960 + 150 = 1110.

"Let's break it down step by step.

Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees. Her sister gathers twice as many, so her sister gathers 2 x 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathers 3 times as many, so her sister gathers 3 x 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

We know that the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples. Let's say Joanne gathers x apples from the average trees. Then her sister gathers 0 apples from the average trees (since she doesn't take any).

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (from the tallest trees) + 15 (from the shortest trees) + x (from the average trees) = 45 + x.

The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (from the tallest trees) + 45 (from the shortest trees) = 105.

Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, we can set up the equation:

45 + x + 105 = 500

Combine like terms:

150 + x = 500

Subtract 150 from both sides:

x = 350

So Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"Let's break it down. 

We know that camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump. We also know that there are 304 bumps in total. 

If we let the number of camels be C and the number of dromedaries be D, we can write an equation for the total number of bumps: 2C + D = 304.

We also know that the total number of heads is 180. Since each animal has one head, we can write another equation: C + D = 180.

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for C and D.

From the second equation, we can write D = 180 - C.

Now we can substitute this expression for D into the first equation: 2C + (180 - C) = 304.

Simplifying the equation, we get C + 180 = 304.

Subtracting 180 from both sides, we get C = 124.

Now that we know C, we can find D: D = 180 - C = 180 - 124 = 56.

So, there are 56 dromedaries.

"Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day for 4 days. So, he traveled 200 x 4 = 800 kilometers in the first 4 days.

Then, he traveled 30% of 800 kilometers over the next 2 days. 30% of 800 is 0.3 x 800 = 240 kilometers. So, he traveled 240 kilometers over the next 2 days.

He didn't travel on the next day, so he didn't travel any kilometers.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day for 7 days. So, he traveled 300 x 7 = 2100 kilometers.

To find the total distance, we add the distance traveled in the first week and the second week. The total distance is 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

"Oliver is at 3,000 feet. Stanley's comb is at 4,000 feet below Stanley, and Stanley is at 10,000 feet. So, Stanley's comb is at 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet. Oliver needs to climb from 3,000 to 6,000 feet.

6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000

The answer is 3000."
"Mr. Josue got $4000 from the first bank. The second bank gave him twice as much, so he got 2 x 4000 = 8000 dollars from the second bank. 

So, he got 4000 + 8000 = 12000 dollars from the banks. 

He initially had 5000 dollars. Now he has 5000 + 12000 = 16000 dollars. 

The answer is 16000."
"First, 4 boats came and took 5 cats each. So, 4 x 5 = 20 cats left the rock. 

Now, there are 50 - 20 = 30 cats left on the rock. 

Then, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. 3/5 of 30 is 18. 

So, 18 cats left the rock. 

Now, we have 30 - 18 = 12 cats left on the rock.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, Bill paid $8 for 6 months. That's 6 x $8 = $48. 

Then, he paid $12 for 8 months. That's 8 x $12 = $96. 

After that, the price went up to $14. There are 12 months in a year, so 2 years is 24 months. Bill already paid for 6 + 8 = 14 months, so he has 24 - 14 = 10 months left at the new price. That's 10 x $14 = $140.

Now, let's add up all the money Bill paid: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The final answer is: $284"
"Let's break it down step by step.

The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. So, if the tattered jeans cost $28, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

He saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means he saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans and 2/3 of the savings from the tattered jeans.

Let's say the savings from the jogger jeans is x. Then, the savings from the tattered jeans is 2x.

We know that the total savings is $6. So, x + 2x = 6.

Combine like terms: 3x = 6.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 2.

So, the savings from the jogger jeans is $2 and the savings from the tattered jeans is 2x = 2 * 2 = $4.

The jogger jeans cost $22 and the tattered jeans cost $28. The difference is $28 - $22 = $6.

The jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to add up the number of employees that can fit in each type of vehicle.

6 minibusses can hold 30 employees. 
30 x 6 = 180 employees can fit in the minibusses.

10 minivans can hold 15 employees. 
15 x 10 = 150 employees can fit in the minivans.

Now, we add up the number of employees that can fit in each type of vehicle.

"Lillian made 3 bird feeders and bought 3 bird feeders. So, she has 3 + 3 = 6 bird feeders.

The store-bought bird feeders attract 20 birds each. The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

There are 3 store-bought bird feeders, so they attract 3 x 20 = 60 birds. There are 3 bird feeders Lillian made herself, so they attract 3 x 30 = 90 birds.

In total, Lillian can expect to see 60 + 90 = 150 birds in her garden each day.

"To find out how much Aleksandra paid, we need to know the price of the soup and the cake. 

The bagel cost $4. The soup is 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.25. 

$4 x 0.25 = $1

Now we add $1 to $4 to find the price of the soup. 

$4 + $1 = $5

The cake is half the price of the bagel. To find half of $4, we divide $4 by 2.

$4 ÷ 2 = $2

Now we add the prices of the bagel, soup, and cake together to find the total cost of the dinner.

$4 + $5 + $2 = $11

The final answer is: $11"
"Let's break it down step by step.

Kenny has $50 in spending cash and he needs $100 to go to the amusement park. So, he needs $100 - $50 = $50 more.

He plans to sell his cards for $1.5 each. To find out how many cards he needs to sell, we divide the amount he needs ($50) by the price of each card ($1.5).

$50 ÷ $1.5 = 33.33

Since Kenny can't sell a fraction of a card, we round down to 33 cards. This is the number of cards he needs to sell to get the remaining $50.

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sells is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's call the total number of cards he started with 'x'.

2/3 of x = 33

To find 'x', we multiply both sides by 3/2.

x = 33 × (3/2)
x = 49.5

Since Kenny can't have a fraction of a card, we round up to 50 cards."
"The caterer prepared for half of the guests to have 2 hotdogs. That means he prepared for 36 / 2 = 18 guests to have 2 hotdogs. 

So, he prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs. 

But 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. That means 40 guests got a second hotdog. 

So, the total number of hotdogs given out is 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 36 hotdogs, he didn't have enough for 80 hotdogs. That means 80 - 36 = 44 hotdogs were not enough.

But we want to know how many guests did not get a second hotdog. We know that 36 hotdogs were prepared, and 40 guests showed up. If 80 hotdogs were given out, that means 4 hotdogs were not given out. 

So, 4 hotdogs were not given out, and each guest gets 2 hotdogs. That means 4 / 2 = 2 guests did not get a second hotdog.

Indras has 6 letters in her name. 

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters. 

To find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name: 6 + 7 = 13.

"To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the pot and pans, the mixing bowls, and the 5 utensils. 

Cost of pot and pans: $120.00
Cost of mixing bowls: $20.00
Cost of 5 utensils: 5 x $5.00 = $25.00

Now, let's add them together: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

The total cost before the discount is $165.00.

Now, we need to find 20% of $165.00 to calculate the discount. 

20% of $165.00 = 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

The final answer is: $132.00"

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container.

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we need to convert gallons to pints. 

3 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints per container.

Josey needed 1/4 of a container. 

1/4 * 24 pints = 6 pints.

George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left. This means he spent 99% of his money. 

First, we need to find out how much money George had left. 1% of $5 is 0.01 x 5 = $0.05. 

So, he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

Since he bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, the total cost of chips is 3 x 0.40 = $1.20.

Now, we need to find out how much money he spent on candy bars. He spent $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75 on candy bars.

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is $3.75 / 0.75 = 5.

Now, they want to share the oranges with 6 other friends. So, they have 6 friends in total, including Sitti and Juris. That's 8 people.

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the number of people. 56 ÷ 8 = 7.

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"Antoine wants 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount. So, he needs 2 x 2 = 4 pounds of onions. 

The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound. So, 4 pounds of onions will cost 4 x $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box is $2.00. So, 2 boxes will cost 2 x $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people. To find the cost per serving, we need to divide the total cost by the number of people it serves. 

$12.00 ÷ 6 = $2.00

The cost per serving is $2.00."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Wayne is staying close to the theater, so it takes him 4 minutes to get there. Bernadette is staying far away, so it takes her 4 times as long as Wayne to get there. 

4 times as long as Wayne is 4 x 4 = 16 minutes. 

So, it takes Bernadette 16 minutes to get to the theater. 

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette should arrive 4 - 5 = -1 minutes before Wayne. But since you can't arrive before you leave, Bernadette should leave 1 minute before Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him.

So Bernadette should leave 1 minute earlier than Wayne.

Jon's total time is 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (1 hour 20 minutes) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes.

James swims 10% faster than Jon, so James swims 40 * 0.9 = 36 minutes.

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so James takes 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

James' total time is 36 (swim) + 85 (bike) + x (run) = 180 minutes.

"First, we need to find out how many miles the horse ran. The horse ran for 30 minutes, and we need to convert this to hours because the speed is in miles per hour. 

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours.

Now, we multiply the speed (32MPH) by the time (0.5 hours) to get the distance. 

Distance = speed * time = 32 * 0.5 = 16 miles.

The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, so for 16 miles, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so 8 bails will cost 8 * 3 = $24.

Michael has 6 five-dollar bills, which is 6 * 5 = $30.

Each student gets 10 cards. So, the number of students is 300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each. So, she paid 20 x 45 cents = 900 cents. 

Since 100 cents is 1 dollar, 900 cents is 9 dollars. 

Becky got a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = 8 dollars.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each. So, she paid 20 x 50 cents = 1000 cents. 

Since 100 cents is 1 dollar, 1000 cents is 10 dollars. 

Kelly got a 10 percent discount. 10 percent of 10 dollars is 1 dollar. So, Kelly paid 10 - 1 = 9 dollars.

Kelly paid 9 dollars and Becky paid 8 dollars. So, Kelly paid 9 - 8 = 1 dollar more than Becky.

"Let's break it down step by step.

Each room has 2 sheets. 
Each room has 1 comforter. 
Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 pillow cases. 
Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so that's 2 x 4 = 8 towels.

So, each room has 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15 pieces of laundry.

If there are 80 rooms, then the total number of pieces of laundry is 80 x 15 = 1200.

"Let's count the shoes Fireman Frank gets. 

He gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday. Since a pair has 2 shoes, he gets 5 x 2 = 10 shoes.

He gets 15 pairs of shoes on Wednesday. He gets 15 x 2 = 30 shoes.

He gets 30 pairs of shoes on Friday. He gets 30 x 2 = 60 shoes.

Now, let's count the total shoes he got. 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 shoes.

He already had 200 shoes. Now he has 200 + 100 = 300 shoes.

But he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday. So, he has 300 - 180 = 120 shoes left.

The answer is 120."
"Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles. Each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes. So, she has 6 x 8 = 48 cupcakes to decorate. 

Each pan holds 12 cupcakes. To find out how many pans she needs, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per pan. 48 ÷ 12 = 4. 

The answer is 4."
"Let's break it down step by step.

The pen cost $2. 
The paper cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen. 
Three times the price of the pen is 3 x $2 = $6. 
$1 less than $6 is $6 - $1 = $5. 
So the paper cost $5. 
The total cost is $2 (pen) + $5 (paper) = $7. 
Theo gave the cashier $10. 
The change is $10 - $7 = $3.

"Let's break it down step by step.

1. There are 30 students in Marissa's class, and each student started with 10 pencils. So, the total number of pencils at the beginning is 30 x 10 = 300 pencils.

2. After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. 1/5 of 300 is 300 / 5 = 60 pencils. So, 60 pencils were used.

3. Now, let's find out how many pencils are left after two months. 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

4. At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. 1/3 of 240 is 240 / 3 = 80 pencils.

"Let's break it down. 

If Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he gets 2 extra cookies for cleaning his room, then he needs to eat 5 - 2 = 3 cookies from eating carrot sticks.

If he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, then the number of carrot sticks he eats is twice the number of cookies he gets from eating carrot sticks. 

So, if he gets 3 cookies from eating carrot sticks, then he must eat 3 x 2 = 6 carrot sticks. 

The answer is 6."
"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to multiply the number of remoras by their length. 

2 remoras * 6 inches = 12 inches

Now, we need to convert the shark's length to inches because the remoras' length is in inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches
10 feet = 10 * 12 = 120 inches

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras make up. 

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / shark's length) * 100
= (12 / 120) * 100
= 0.1 * 100
= 10%

"Let's say the total number of students is x. 

Three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, so one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We know that one-fourth of the students is 20. 

To find one-fourth of the total number of students, we can divide 20 by 1/4. To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal. 

20 / (1/4) = 20 * 4 = 80

So, one-fourth of the students is 80. To find the total number of students, we can multiply 80 by 4.

x = 80 * 4
x = 320

"To find out how many days Jason has to walk, we need to multiply the number of days he has left by the number of days he walks per week. 

There are 7 days in a week and Jason has 3 weeks. So, the total number of days he has is 7 * 3 = 21 days.

Since Jason walks 4 days a week, we need to multiply the total number of days by the number of days he walks per week. 

21 days / 3 weeks = 7 days per week. 
7 days per week * 4 days per week = 28 days. 

Now, we need to find out how many minutes he has to walk each day. 

There are 240 minutes in total and he has 28 days to walk.

Sarah spent $300 on the books. Each book costs $15. 

To find out how many books she bought, we need to divide the total money she spent by the cost of each book. 

300 ÷ 15 = 20

So, Sarah bought 20 books. 

She gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids. To find out how many books each child got, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of kids.

"Let's break it down. 

First, we know 9 kids are allergic to dairy and 6 are allergic to peanuts. But 3 are allergic to both, so we have to subtract those 3 from both groups because they are counted twice. 

So, kids allergic to dairy: 9 - 3 = 6
Kids allergic to peanuts: 6 - 3 = 3

Now, we add the kids allergic to dairy and peanuts, but we have to add back the 3 that are allergic to both because they were subtracted twice. 

Kids allergic to dairy or peanuts: 6 + 3 + 3 = 12

Now, we know there are 32 kids in the class. We subtract the kids allergic to dairy or peanuts to find out how many aren't allergic to anything.

Kids not allergic to anything: 32 - 12 = 20

The total number of people going on the tour is 607."
"To find the cost of the hotel, we need to find 20% of $1500 and add it to $1500. 

20% of $1500 is 0.2 x 1500 = $300. 

So the hotel costs $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day. 

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is $1800 x 3 = $5400.

The plane tickets cost $5000 each, and they are 2 people, so the total cost of the plane tickets is $5000 x 2 = $10000.

The total cost of the trip is $5400 (hotel) + $10000 (plane tickets) = $13600.

The final answer is: $13600"

"Let's break it down step by step.

Uncle Ben has 4 horses. Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal. He feeds them twice a day, so each horse eats 5 x 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since he has 4 horses, the total amount of oats they eat per day is 10 x 4 = 40 pounds.

He needs oats for 5 days, so the total amount of oats he needs is 40 x 5 = 200 pounds.

One bag of oats contains 50 pounds. To find out how many bags he needs, we divide the total amount of oats needed by the amount in one bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats."

Since she buys 2 packs, but only pays for 1, she gets 4 razors. 

The cost of 1 pack is $4.00, so the cost of 1 razor is $4.00 / 4 = $1.00. 

The cost of 1 razor after the discount is $1.00. 

To convert dollars to cents, we multiply by 100. 

$1.00 * 100 = 100 cents.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find the average height of the 9 cheerleaders who are 64"" tall. 

9 cheerleaders are 64"" tall, so we add 9 x 64 = 576 inches. 

To find the average, we divide by 9: 576 / 9 = 64 inches. 

The 10th cheerleader is 60"" tall. 

Now, we need to find the total height of the human pyramid.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

The first venue costs $200, plus $5 for each guest. So, the total cost for the first venue is 200 + 5x, where x is the number of guests.

The second venue costs $25 for each guest, and food is already included, so the total cost for the second venue is 25x.

We want to find out when the two costs are equal, so we set them equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, we need to solve for x. To do that, we need to get all the x terms on one side of the equation. We can do that by subtracting 5x from both sides:

200 = 25x - 5x
200 = 20x

Now, we need to get x by itself. To do that, we can divide both sides by 20:

200 / 20 = x
10 = x

So, Mark needs 10 guests for the two venues to be equal in cost."
"Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say David found x insects. 
Since Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found x + 7 insects. 
Since David found half of what Bodhi found, Bodhi found 2x insects (because if David found half, then Bodhi found double). 
So, the total number of insects is x + (x + 7) + 2x = 43. 
Combine like terms: 4x + 7 = 43. 
Subtract 7 from both sides: 4x = 36. 
Divide both sides by 4: x = 9. 
So David found 9 insects. 
Lily found 9 + 7 = 16 insects.

To find 1/4 of 364, we divide 364 by 4. 

364 ÷ 4 = 91

So Mariah used 91 yards of yarn.

Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn. To find 1/2 of 364, we divide 364 by 2.

364 ÷ 2 = 182

So Mariah's grandma used 182 yards of yarn.

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the total number of snowshoes.

24 legs / 2 = 12 snowshoes

Now, we know Mario needs 12 snowshoes, and each pair costs $12.00. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of snowshoes by the cost of each pair.

Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, Kelsie made 9 * 2 = 18 cookies.

The final answer is: 18"
"Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. 

First, let's find the total amount of money Ali has. 
4 x 10 = 40 (from $10 bills)
6 x 20 = 120 (from $20 bills)
Total money = 40 + 120 = 160

Ali gives half of the total money to his sister. 
Half of 160 = 160 / 2 = 80
Ali has 160 - 80 = 80 left.

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner. 
3/5 of 80 = (3 x 80) / 5 = 240 / 5 = 48
Ali has 80 - 48 = 32 left.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's break it down step by step.

Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house. We need to convert 2 hours into minutes. 

1 hour = 60 minutes
2 hours = 2 x 60 = 120 minutes

So, Rob takes 120 minutes to shingle a house.

Now, it's given that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. 

Double the time Rob takes = 2 x 120 = 240 minutes
Royce takes 40 minutes more than that = 240 + 40 = 280 minutes

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house.

The final answer is: 280"
"To find out how many skeins of wool Martha needs, we need to add up the number of skeins needed for each item for all three grandchildren.

For a hat, she needs 2 skeins for each child, so 2 x 3 = 6 skeins.
For a scarf, she needs 4 skeins for each child, so 4 x 3 = 12 skeins.
For a sweater, she needs 12 skeins for each child, so 12 x 3 = 36 skeins.
For mittens, she needs 1 skein for each child, so 1 x 3 = 3 skeins.
For socks, she needs 2 skeins for each child, so 2 x 3 = 6 skeins.

Now, we add up all the skeins: 6 + 12 + 36 + 3 + 6 = 63 skeins.

The answer is: 63"
"Let's break it down step by step.

Chris has 100 math problems to complete in total. 

On Monday, he completes 12 problems. So, he has 100 - 12 = 88 problems left.

On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. He did 12 problems on Monday, so on Tuesday, he completes 3 x 12 = 36 problems. Now, he has 88 - 36 = 52 problems left.

On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems. One-quarter means 1/4, so he completes 1/4 x 52 = 13 problems. Now, he has 52 - 13 = 39 problems left.

So, Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday.

"Tony picks 6 quarts per hour. 
Bobby picks 1 less than Tony, so Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour. 
Kathy picks 2 times as many as Bobby, so Kathy picks 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour. 
Ricky picks 2 less than Kathy, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour. 
To find the total, we add the quarts picked by each person: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29.

"They baked 200 loaves. They sold 93 in the morning and 39 in the afternoon. That's 93 + 39 = 132 loaves sold. They got 6 back from the grocery store. So they have 200 - 132 + 6 = 74 loaves left.

"Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in a row. He has 36 red tulips. To find out how many rows of red tulips he can plant, we need to divide 36 by 6. 

36 ÷ 6 = 6

Jackson can fit 8 blue tulips in a row. He has 24 blue tulips. To find out how many rows of blue tulips he can plant, we need to divide 24 by 8.

24 ÷ 8 = 3

So, Jackson can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips.

The final answer is: 9"
"Heather has 27 cups of raisins. She wants to divide it equally among oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix. That means she will divide the raisins into 3 parts. 

27 cups / 3 = 9 cups for each part.

A batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make, we need to divide 9 cups by 3/4.

To divide 9 by 3/4, we can multiply 9 by 4/3.

9 * 4/3 = 12

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

The final answer is: 12"
"Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. She is adding a device that will consume 2 kilowatts per hour a day. 

First, we need to find out how much she will consume per day after adding the new device. 
12 (her current consumption) + 2 (new device) = 14 kilowatts per hour.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we need to multiply 14 kilowatts per hour by 24 hours to get the daily consumption. 
14 * 24 = 336 kilowatts per day.

Since a kilowatt per hour is $1.50, we need to multiply 336 kilowatts per day by $1.50 to get the daily cost. 
336 * 1.50 = $504 per day.

Ada's weekly consumption before adding the new device is 12 * 24 * 7 = 2016 kilowatts per week. 
The weekly cost before adding the new device is 2016 * 1.50 = $3024 per week.

Ada's weekly consumption after adding the new device is 336 * 7 = 2352 kilowatts per week. 
The weekly cost after adding the new device is 2352 * 1.50 = $3528 per week.

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is $3528 - $3024 = $504.

The final answer is: $504"
"If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, that means one person can paint a whole house in 10 days. 

If one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, that means one person can paint a whole house in 10 x 24 = 240 hours.

If 5 people can paint a whole house in 240 hours, then it will take 240 / 5 = 48 hours for 5 people to paint a whole house.

The answer is 48."
"Ophelia has 20 sofas. 

Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, but we don't know how many chairs Jenna has. We know Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. 

If Ophelia has 20 sofas, then Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. 3 x 20 = 60. So Jenna has 60 chairs. 

Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So Jenna has 60 - 2 = 58 sofas. 

Ophelia has 20 sofas and Jenna has 58 sofas. The total number of sofas is 20 + 58 = 78.

Ophelia has 20 chairs. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So Jenna has 3 x 20 = 60 chairs. 

The total number of chairs is 20 + 60 = 80.

The total number of sofas and chairs is 78 + 80 = 158."
"Tom paid $48 for a CD and a headphone set. The CD cost $4. So the headphone set cost $48 - $4 = $44. 

If Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have had $48 + $4 = $52 to spend on CDs. 

Since each CD costs $4, Tom could buy $52 / $4 = 13 CDs. 

Tom already bought 1 CD. So if he had not bought the headphone set, he could have bought 13 - 1 = 12 more CDs."
"Let's break it down. Josh spent 4 hours working out every week except for some occasions. 

He spent 5 hours for 2 weeks, so that's 5 x 2 = 10 hours. 

He also spent 6 hours in one week. 

Now, let's find out how many weeks he spent 4 hours. We know he spent 5 hours for 2 weeks and 6 hours for 1 week, so that's 3 weeks in total. Since there are 8 weeks, he spent 4 hours for 8 - 3 = 5 weeks.

So, the total hours he spent working out at 4 hours per week is 4 x 5 = 20 hours.

Now, let's add up all the hours: 20 + 10 + 6 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's break it down step by step.

1. 48 people are riding the bus initially.
2. At the first stop, 8 people get off. So, the number of people left is 48 - 8 = 40.
3. Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus. So, 5 x 8 = 40 people get in. Now, the total number of people is 40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80.
4. At the second stop, 21 people get off. So, the number of people left is 80 - 21 = 59.
5. Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. This means 3 times 21 is 63, but 3 times fewer means 21 - 63 = -42. But you can't have a negative number of people getting on the bus, so it means 3 times fewer is 63 - 21 = 42 fewer. So, 21 - 42 = -21 people get on.

"Let's break it down step by step.

Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so now he is 27 - 5 = 22 years old.

In 8 years, Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old.

In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 x 30 = 60. 5 years younger than that is 60 - 5 = 55.

So, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old.

Now, we need to find out how old Jame's cousin is now. Since in 8 years, his cousin will be 55, now his cousin is 55 - 8 = 47 years old.

The question asks how many years separate the age of the two now. Jame is 22 years old and his cousin is 47 years old. 

The difference between their ages is 47 - 22 = 25 years."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer. The computer cost $1,100. So, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Errol spent $2,400 in total. The computer cost $1,100 and the printer cost $700. So, the total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.

To find the cost of the monitors, we need to subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost. So, $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

Since Errol bought 2 monitors, we need to divide the cost of the monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor. $600 / 2 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break it down step by step.

There are 20 kids in total. They were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. So, there are 10 girls and 10 boys.

The boys brought back 60 shells each. So, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 x 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 x 60 shells.

First, let's find 4 x 60. 4 x 60 = 240.

Now, let's add 600 and 240. 600 + 240 = 840.

So, the girls brought 840 shells in total. Since there are 10 girls, we need to divide 840 by 10 to find out how many shells each girl brought.

840 ÷ 10 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"

"Let's find out the thickness of each book. 

The first book is 31 mm thick. 
The second book is 50 mm thick. 
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it's 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick. 
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it's 2 x 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add up the thickness of all the books: 
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188

"Let's count how many vlogs Emma made in the first three weeks. 

She made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Emma made 54 vlogs in the first three weeks. To find out how many vlogs she needs to make to complete 72 vlogs, we need to subtract 54 from 72.

72 - 54 = 18

So, Emma should make 18 vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

"To find out how much you paid, we need to first find out how much the tip is. 

The tip is 20% of $50. To find 20% of a number, we multiply the number by 0.2. 

So, 20% of $50 is $50 x 0.2 = $10.

Now, we add the tip to the bill. 

$50 (bill) + $10 (tip) = $60.

So, you paid $60."
"Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money the eldest boy got. We know that $18 is shared among 3 boys. So, we divide $18 by 3 to find out how much each boy got.

$18 / 3 = $6

So, the eldest boy got $6.

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so now he has $6 + $5 = $11.

The next day, he added another $10, so now he has $11 + $10 = $21.

Then, he spent $8, so now he has $21 - $8 = $13.

After that, he tripled the amount he had left, which means he multiplied it by 3. So, $13 * 3 = $39.

The final answer is: $39"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Elvis wants to save $1125 in total. He wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. 

Let's say he saves x dollars in the first half. Then, he will save 2x dollars in the second half. 

The total amount he will save is x + 2x = 3x. 

Since he wants to save $1125 in total, we can set up the equation: 3x = 1125.

To find x, we need to divide both sides by 3: x = 1125 / 3 = 375.

So, he saves $375 in the first half. 

Now, we need to find out how much he saves in the second half. We know that he saves twice as much in the second half as in the first half, so he saves 2 * 375 = 750 dollars in the second half.

The final answer is: $750"
"Let's count the money Verna spent. 

She bought 3 apples for $1.50 each, so she spent 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
She bought 5 oranges for $0.80 each, so she spent 5 x $0.80 = $4.
She bought 6 peaches for $0.75 each, so she spent 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the money she spent. $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

Verna gave $20, so she got $20 - $13 = $7 as change.

The final answer is $7."

Jairus will get $16 - $10 = $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars.

We know that the total amount of money is 100 dollars. So, we can write an equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

So Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4(20) = 80 dollars.

"Let's break it down step by step.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long. Twice as long as 16 minutes is 2 x 16 = 32 minutes. 2 minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

So, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes when the water is warm.

To find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3. 16 x 3 = 48 minutes.

To find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a warm day, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3. 34 x 3 = 102 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day. We subtract the time it takes on a cold day from the time it takes on a hot day. 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

The total cost is x + 3x = 4x dollars. 

We know that the total cost is $40. So, 4x = 40. 

To find x, we need to divide both sides by 4. x = 40 / 4 = 10.

"Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. If we don't know the daily recommended cups, we can call it x. So, Octavia drinks x/2 cups.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks. So, Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

Juan's doctor wants him to drink 4 cups of coffee. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we need to subtract 4 from the amount he currently drinks. 

5x - 4 = ?

We know that Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks. If Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups, then the daily recommended cups must be 2 times what Octavia drinks. So, x = 2 * (x/2) = x. This means x is the daily recommended cups. 

Since x is the daily recommended cups, we can say that 5x is 10 times the daily recommended cups. But we also know that 10 times the daily recommended cups is 10 * 4 = 40 cups. So, 5x = 40. 

Now we can solve for x: 
5x = 40
x = 40 / 5
x = 8

Now we can find out how many cups Juan must reduce his coffee intake by:
5x - 4 = 5 * 8 - 4

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. Judy had 12 cups, so her friend had 40 - 12 = 28 cups. Judy had 24 dishes, so her friend had 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

To find the total number of utensils, we add the cups and dishes Judy and her friend brought. Judy brought 12 + 24 = 36 utensils. Her friend brought 28 + 44 = 72 utensils. 36 + 72 = 108.

The final answer is 108."
"If 90 contacts last 45 days, then 1 contact will last 45/90 = 0.5 days. 

Since there are 7 days in a week, 0.5 days is half a week. 

If 90 contacts last 45 days, then 1 contact will last half a week. 

If 1 contact lasts half a week, then 1 week will have 2 contacts. 

If 1 week has 2 contacts, then 1 day will have 2/7 contacts. 

If 1 day has 2/7 contacts, then 1 day will have 2/7 * 90 = 26 contacts. 

If 1 box has 90 contacts and will last 45 days, then 1 box will have 26 contacts per day. 

If 1 box has 26 contacts per day, then 2 boxes will have 52 contacts per day. 

If 2 boxes will last 1 day, then 2 boxes will cost $100.00 * 0.1 = $10.00 off. 

If 2 boxes cost $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00, then 2 boxes will cost $90.00 / 52 = $1.73 per contact. 

If 2 boxes cost $1.73 per contact, then 1 contact will cost $1.73 / 2 = $0.865 per contact. 

Since we are looking for the cost of a pair of contacts, we need to multiply the cost of 1 contact by 2. 

$0.865 * 2 = $1.73"
"Let's break it down step by step.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday. So, Jill worked a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so John worked 2 x 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.

John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so John worked 3 x 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.

So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Tabitha agreed to pay $10 an hour. So, Jill earned 3 x $10 = $30 and John earned 7 x $10 = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings. $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"Hannah burns 500 calories/hour doing aerobics and she does it for 2 hours. So, she burns 500 * 2 = 1000 calories doing aerobics.

Hannah also burns 600 calories/hour running and she does it for 1 hour. So, she burns 600 * 1 = 600 calories running.

In total, Hannah burns 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, she needs to drink 1600 / 200 = 8 times 100 ml of water.

8 times 100 ml is 8 * 100 = 800 ml.

The final answer is: 800"
"Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is x. 

Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is x - (1% of x) = x - 0.01x = 0.99x.

Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of green jelly beans is x + (1% of x) = x + 0.01x = 1.01x.

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation: x + 0.99x + 1.01x = 4500.

Combine like terms: 3.00x = 4500.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 1500.

Now we know the number of blue jelly beans is 1500. 

The number of red jelly beans is 0.99x = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485.

The number of green jelly beans is 1.01x = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515.

To find out how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans: 1515 - 1485 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the average, we need to add up all the measurements and then divide by 3.

First, we add up the measurements: 47 + 52 + (52 + 5) = 47 + 52 + 57 = 156

Then, we divide by 3: 156 / 3 = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"If Martin eats Cheerios, he loses 1.25 pounds/week. If he eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds/week. 

To find the difference in weight, we need to find out how much weight he loses or gains in 5 weeks. 

If he eats Cheerios, he loses 1.25 pounds/week. In 5 weeks, he will lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds. 

If he eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds/week. In 5 weeks, he will gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds. 

The difference in weight is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

"Let's break it down step by step.

Alex invites 100 people via email. Each of them will bring 2 friends, so that's 100 x 2 = 200 more people. 

Now, Alex also calls 10 friends and 8 of them will bring their spouses. That's 10 friends and 8 spouses, which is 18 more people.

So, the total number of people is 100 (initially invited) + 200 (from email invites) + 18 (from phone calls) = 318 people.

Alex needs 318 seats."
"The Dachshund weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighed 10 x 2 = 20 pounds. 

The Papillon weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighed 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighed 5 x 44 = 220 pounds.

The answer is 220."
"Let's break it down. 

On Amazon, the boots cost $16 and shipping costs $4. So, the total cost is $16 + $4 = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13 and shipping costs twice as much as Amazon, which is $4 x 2 = $8. So, the total cost is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay. $21 - $20 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"The beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles every day. We need to find out how many days it takes to be taller than 20 feet.

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 x 2 = 8 feet

Day 4: 16 x 2 = 32 feet

The beanstalk is taller than 20 feet on the 4th day."
"To find out how much protein John gets per day, we need to divide the protein in one cup of mushrooms by the weight of one cup of mushrooms. 

3 grams of protein / 100 grams of mushrooms = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms.

Now, we need to find out how many grams of mushrooms John eats per day. 

John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day.

So, the amount of protein John gets per day is: 
0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms * 200 grams of mushrooms = 6 grams of protein per day.

To find out how much protein John gets per week, we need to multiply the amount of protein he gets per day by 7 (the number of days in a week).

6 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's say Jerry's current age is x. 

Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, so we can write an equation: x = 2(x - 5)

We can solve for x by expanding the equation: x = 2x - 10

Now, let's move x to the right side of the equation: x - 2x = -10

Combine like terms: -x = -10

Multiply both sides by -1: x = 10

So Jerry is 10 years old now. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is: 13"
"George needs 2 implants. Each implant costs $2000. So 2 implants will cost 2 x $2000 = $4000. 

One implant has a crown made of porcelain, which costs $500 extra. So the total cost for that implant is $2000 + $500 = $2500. The other implant costs $2000. So the total cost for both implants is $2500 + $2000 = $4500.

George already paid a deposit of $600. So he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work, we need to divide the amount he still needs to pay ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15). 

$3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's say the smallest angle is x. 

One angle is twice the smallest angle, so that angle is 2x. 

One angle is three times the smallest angle, so that angle is 3x.

The three angles add up to 180 degrees, so we can write an equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees. 

One angle is twice the smallest angle, so that angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees.

One angle is three times the smallest angle, so that angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's count the money Colby has. 

8 quarters = 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
6 dimes = 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add all the money together. 
200 + 60 = 260
260 + 70 = 330
330 + 15 = 345 cents

Since 1 dollar is 100 cents, we can convert 345 cents to dollars and cents. 
345 cents = 3 dollars and 45 cents

Now, let's find out how many gumballs Colby can buy with 3 dollars and 45 cents. 
1 gumball costs 5 cents. 
3 dollars = 3 x 100 cents = 300 cents
300 + 45 = 345 cents
Now, let's divide 345 cents by 5 cents. 
345 / 5 = 69

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."

"To find out how many hours it takes to travel 2000 miles, we need to know the speed of the plane. 

Speed is distance divided by time. 

Distance = 1200 miles
Time = 3 hours

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1200 / 3
Speed = 400 miles per hour

Now, we know the speed of the plane is 400 miles per hour. To find out how many hours it takes to travel 2000 miles, we divide the distance by the speed.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2000 / 400
Time = 5 hours

The plane would take 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

On Monday, Howard spends $8 dollars.

On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as Monday, so he spends 2 x $8 = $16.

On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spends 4 x $16 = $64.

Now, let's add up how much he spent in total: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

He originally had $100, so to find out how much he has left, we need to subtract how much he spent from the original amount: $100 - $88 = $12.

"To find out how much each pump costs, we need to know how many pumps are in the bottle and how much the bottle costs. 

The bottle costs $24.00. We need to convert this to cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so we multiply 24 by 100.

24 x 100 = 2400 cents

The bottle costs 2400 cents. 

The bottle will give 120 washings with 2 pumps. So, to find out how many pumps are in the bottle, we divide 120 by 2.

120 / 2 = 60

There are 60 pumps in the bottle. 

To find out how much each pump costs, we divide the cost of the bottle by the number of pumps.

2400 / 60 = 40

So, each pump costs 40 cents."
"To find out how much money Joe will have left, we need to first find out how much he will pay for the outfit. 

First, we need to find the total price of the outfit before the discount. The shirt is $25 and the shorts are $35. 

$25 + $35 = $60

Now, we need to find 30% of $60 to find the discount. 

30% of $60 is 0.3 x $60 = $18

Now, we need to subtract the discount from the total price to find the price after the discount. 

$60 - $18 = $42

So, Joe will pay $42 for the outfit. 

Now, we need to find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase. Joe started with $50. 

$50 - $42 = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan needs, we need to know how many croissants he's making and how much butter each croissant needs.

He's making 4 dozen croissants a day. 1 dozen is 12, so 4 dozen is 4 x 12 = 48 croissants.

Each croissant needs 1/4 pound of butter. To find out how much butter 48 croissants need, we multiply 48 by 1/4.

To multiply a number by a fraction, we multiply the number by the numerator (1) and then divide by the denominator (4). 

48 x 1 = 48
48 / 4 = 12

So, 48 croissants need 12 pounds of butter.

Since he's making croissants for a week, we need to multiply the amount of butter he needs for one day by 7.

12 x 7 = 84

The answer is 84."
"To find out how much it costs to repave Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of his street. 

Cost per meter = $194
Length of Lewis' street = 490 meters

Cost to repave Lewis' street = Cost per meter * Length of Lewis' street
= $194 * 490
= $95,060

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street.

Cost to repave Monica's street = Cost per meter * Length of Monica's street
= $194 * 150
= $29,100

Cost difference = Cost to repave Lewis' street - Cost to repave Monica's street
= $95,060 - $29,100
= $65,960

The final answer is: $65,960"
"John gets $100,000 for the first 5 months. After that, it takes 10 times 5 months, which is 50 months. 

The first 5 months cost $100,000. The next 50 months cost 50% more than the first month, which is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000. 

Since there are 50 months, the total cost for the next 50 months is $150,000 * 50 = $7,500,000.

The total cost is $100,000 + $7,500,000 = $7,600,000.

The final answer is: $7,600,000"
"The first player ate 6 ounces of steak. 

The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so he ate 8 ounces of beef tips. 

The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since one pound is 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces of steak. 

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they ate no meat. 

To find the total amount of meat eaten, we add the ounces eaten by the first, second, and third players. 

6 + 8 + 16 = 30

"Let's break it down step by step.

Scarlett found the aquarium for $10.00.

She bought 2 bags of rocks for $2.50 each. 
2 x $2.50 = $5.00

She bought 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each. 
3 x $2.00 = $6.00

She bought 20 fish at $0.50 each. 
20 x $0.50 = $10.00

She bought fish food for $2.00.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent $33.00."
"So, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall after the first week. 

Then, it doubled in height, so it became 3 x 2 = 6 inches tall after the second week.

Then, it grew another 4 inches in the third week, so we add 4 to 6, which is 6 + 4 = 10 inches.

So, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks.

1. There are 4 rows of seats with 18 seats in each row. So, the total number of seats is 4 x 18 = 72.

2. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. One-fourth of 72 is 72 / 4 = 18. So, 18 seats were occupied by the administrators.

3. Now, we need to find out how many seats were left after the administrators occupied their seats. 72 - 18 = 54 seats were left.

4. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. One-third of 54 is 54 / 3 = 18. So, 18 seats were occupied by the parents.

5. Now, we need to find out how many seats were left after the parents occupied their seats. 54 - 18 = 36 seats were left.

6. The rest of the seats were occupied by the students. So, the number of students is 36.

The final answer is: 36"
"First, we need to find the total number of street lights. We know that each intersection has 6 poles and each pole has 4 street lights. 

So, the total number of street lights at one intersection is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

Now, we need to subtract the number of non-functioning street lights. There are 20 street lights that are not working.

So, the total number of functioning street lights is 96 - 20 = 76.

"To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played, we need to add the number of times each DVD has been played so far and then subtract that from the total number of times each DVD can be played.

The first DVD has been played 356 times. It can be played 1000 times before it breaks. So, it can be played 1000 - 356 = 644 more times.

The second DVD has been played 135 times. It can be played 1000 times before it breaks. So, it can be played 1000 - 135 = 865 more times.

Now, we add the number of times each DVD can be played more: 644 + 865 = 1509.

So, both DVDs can be played 1509 times before they break."
"John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks. He went twice a week, so that's 2 times a week. 2 times a week for 6 weeks is 2 x 6 = 12 times. 

Each time he went for 2 hours. So, he went for 12 times x 2 hours = 24 hours.

Each hour costs $125. So, 24 hours x $125 per hour is $125 x 24 = $3000.

The answer is $3000."

Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kb per second. So, in 1 hour, she can download 20 x 3600 = 72,000 kb.

Since 1 Mb has 1000 kb, we need to divide 72,000 by 1000 to find out how many Mb Ashley can download in 1 hour.

72,000 ÷ 1000 = 72

The tow truck pulled 10 cars for each of the first 3 days. That's 10 x 3 = 30 cars.

Then it pulled 4 fewer cars on each of the remaining days. There are 5 days left in the week. So, it pulled 10 - 4 = 6 cars on each of those days.

6 x 5 = 30 cars.

Now, we add the cars pulled in the first 3 days and the cars pulled in the remaining 5 days. 30 + 30 = 60.

The total number of cars it towed that week is 60."
"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough, we need to subtract his current height from the height needed to ride the roller coaster and then divide by how much he grows each year.

The roller coaster height is 4 feet, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so 4 feet is 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Adam's current height is 40 inches. 

To find out how many inches he needs to grow, we subtract his current height from the roller coaster height: 48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Adam grows 2 inches a year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow 8 inches, we divide 8 by 2: 8 / 2 = 4 years.

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"James sold 10 cars for $25,000 each. So, he sold 10 x $25,000 = $250,000 worth of cars.

The company paid 30% of $25,000 to acquire the cars. 30% of $25,000 is 0.3 x $25,000 = $7,500. So, the company paid $7,500 to acquire each car.

The profit on each car is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

James got a 10% commission on the profits. 10% of $17,500 is 0.1 x $17,500 = $1,750.

James made $1,750 on each car. He sold 10 cars, so he made 10 x $1,750 = $17,500.

The final answer is: $17,500"

First, we know that 25% of the riders can stay upright on the wave. Since there are 100 riders, we need to find 25% of 100.

25% of 100 is 0.25 x 100 = 25 riders who can stay upright.

Next, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women, we need to find 60% of 25.

60% of 25 is 0.6 x 25 = 15 women who can stay upright.

Since there are 25 riders in total who can stay upright, and 15 of them are women, the number of men who can stay upright is 25 - 15 = 10 men.

"Let's break it down step by step.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. 
He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps together: 
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"Let's break it down. 

Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom. Tom is driving 70 miles per hour. To catch up, Tom needs to cover the 75 miles. 

Time = Distance / Speed. 

Distance is 75 miles. Speed is 70 miles per hour. 

Time = 75 miles / 70 miles per hour. 

Time = 1.0714 hours. 

To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60. 

1.0714 hours * 60 = 64.284 minutes. 

But we want to know how long it will take in hours."
"Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish. So Darren caught 17 - 6 = 11 fish.

Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, and Darren caught 11 fish. So Tommy caught 11 + 3 = 14 fish.

The answer is 14."
"Let's think about this. If Manny's parents won't sign him up again if the classes cost more than $10 per class, that means the total cost of the classes should be less than or equal to 10 * 10 = $100. 

Manny already paid $60 for the classes. So, if he misses some classes, the total cost should be less than or equal to $100. 

Let's say he misses x classes. Then, the total number of classes he will attend is 10 - x. 

The cost per class will be $60 / (10 - x). This should be less than or equal to $10. 

So, we can write the inequality: 60 / (10 - x) <= 10

To solve this, we can multiply both sides by (10 - x) to get: 60 <= 10(10 - x)

Now, we can expand the right side: 60 <= 100 - 10x

Now, we can add 10x to both sides: 60 + 10x <= 100

Now, we can subtract 60 from both sides: 10x <= 40

Now, we can divide both sides by 10: x <= 4

So, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 4"
"If Jewel processes 50 customers a day, and Julie is twice as fast, then Julie processes 2 x 50 = 100 customers a day.

There are 7 days in a week. So, Jewel processes 50 x 7 = 350 customers in a week. And Julie processes 100 x 7 = 700 customers in a week.

The total weekly production for the two is 350 + 700 = 1050 customers."

"Let's find out how much one apple costs. If 4 apples cost $5.20, then we divide $5.20 by 4 apples. 

$5.20 ÷ 4 = $1.30 per apple.

Now, let's find out how much one orange costs. If 3 oranges cost $3.30, then we divide $3.30 by 3 oranges.

$3.30 ÷ 3 = $1.10 per orange.

Now, we need to find out how much 5 apples cost. We multiply the cost of one apple by 5.

$1.30 per apple * 5 apples = $6.50

Now, we need to find out how much 5 oranges cost. We multiply the cost of one orange by 5.

$1.10 per orange * 5 oranges = $5.50

Now, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges together.

$6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

So, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to find out how many cubic feet of earth he needs to dig. 

First, we need to find the volume of the hole. The formula for volume is length x width x height. 

Length = 6 feet
Width = 4 feet
Height = 3 feet

Volume = length x width x height
Volume = 6 x 4 x 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Now, we know it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. To find out how long it will take him to shovel 72 cubic feet, we need to multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel 1 cubic foot.

Time = Volume x time per cubic foot
Time = 72 x 3
Time = 216 seconds

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add up the base price and the extra costs.

The base price is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade. 
One-third of $7,500 is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats. 
$2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the base price and the extra costs:
$30,000 + $7,500 = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To find out how much Tim will make in a year, we need to find out how much he will make in a month first. 

First, we need to find out how much his raise is. 5% of $20000 is 0.05 x 20000 = $1000. 

So, his new salary is $20000 + $1000 = $21000.

Then, we need to find out how much his bonus is. His bonus is half a month's salary, which is $20000 / 2 = $10000.

So, his total monthly salary is $21000 + $10000 = $31000.

To find out how much he will make in a year, we multiply his monthly salary by 12. $31000 x 12 = $372000.

"Let's break it down step by step.

James buys 10 suits. Each suit costs $750. So, the total cost of suits is 10 x 750 = 7500 dollars.

The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of a suit. 1/5 of 750 is 150. So, each dress pant costs 150 dollars. James buys 10 dress pants. So, the total cost of dress pants is 10 x 150 = 1500 dollars.

James buys 3 dress shirts per suit. He buys 10 suits, so he buys 10 x 3 = 30 dress shirts. Each dress shirt costs 60 dollars. So, the total cost of dress shirts is 30 x 60 = 1800 dollars.

"Let's break it down step by step.

Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400 in the first month. It's given that this is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. 

So, if red hats sales are $400, then green hats sales are 2 * $400 = $800.

Total sales in the first month = $400 (red) + $800 (green) = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. 

3/4 of $1200 = (3 * $1200) / 4 = $900.

So, total sales in the second month = $900.

Total sales in two months = $1200 (first month) + $900 (second month) = $2100.

"Let's break it down. Sally's bank account had $200 at the start of the week. Now it has $420. That means she got some money, but not all of her wage. 

If her wage should be $300, that means she should have $300 in her account. But she only has $420. So, she got extra money. 

To find out how much extra money she got, we need to subtract the money she should have from the money she actually has. 

$420 (actual money) - $300 (should have) = $120 (extra money)

But the question asks how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage. That means we need to find out how much money is missing from her wage. 

$300 (should have) - $420 (actual money) = -$120 (money missing)

But we can't have a negative number of dollars. So, we need to change the sign. 

-$120 = $120 (money withheld)

"Let's say the number of sheep is S and the number of geese is G. 

Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. 

We know that the total number of legs is 70, so we can write an equation: 4S + 2G = 70.

We also know that the total number of heads is 20, and since sheep and geese both have one head, we can write another equation: S + G = 20.

We can solve the second equation for G: G = 20 - S.

Now we can substitute this expression for G into the first equation: 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get: 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

Combine like terms: 2S + 40 = 70.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 2S = 30.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 15.

8 adults weigh 8 x 80 = 640 kg. 
So, Jack and 8 adults weigh 80 + 640 = 720 kg. 

The elevator can support 700 kg. 
So, they will exceed the maximum load by 720 - 700 = 20 kg. 

The answer is 20."
"Let's break it down step by step.

Katarina has 68 cookies. 

Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, but we don't know how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. We need to find out how many cookies Max has first. We already know Max has 73 cookies.

Now, let's find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, let's add up all the cookies: Katarina has 68 cookies, Max has 73 cookies, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies, and Summer has 96 cookies.

68 + 73 = 141
141 + 61 = 202
202 + 96 = 298

The final answer is: 298"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know the final length of the dress is 140cm. We also know that 20cm of that is the lace trim at the bottom. So, the original length of the dress before adding the lace trim is 140 - 20 = 120cm.

Now, we know that Shania extended the dress by 50% of its original length. Let's call the original length 'x'. So, 50% of 'x' is 0.5x. We know that the extended length is 120cm, so we can write the equation: x + 0.5x = 120.

Combine like terms: 1.5x = 120.

Now, divide both sides by 1.5: x = 120 / 1.5.

x = 80.

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's break it down. 

If Chris mows the whole lawn in 1 hour in turtle mode, that's 60 minutes. 

If he mows the whole lawn in 40 minutes in rabbit mode, that's 40 minutes. 

He mowed half the lawn in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode. So, he mowed half of 60 minutes in turtle mode, and half of 40 minutes in rabbit mode. 

Half of 60 minutes is 30 minutes. Half of 40 minutes is 20 minutes. 

So, it took him 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to mow the lawn.

The final answer is 50."

"To find the total amount Catherine paid, we need to add up the cost of all the fruits she bought.

First, let's find the cost of the apples: 1 kilo of apples for $4.

Next, let's find the cost of the bananas: 2 kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo, so 2 x $2 = $4.

Then, let's find the cost of the oranges: 2 kilos of oranges for $3 per kilo, so 2 x $3 = $6.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the fruits: $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

"Greta bakes 30 cookies. Celinda bakes twice as many, so she bakes 2 x 30 = 60 cookies. 

In total, they baked 30 + 60 = 90 cookies. 

They ate 10 cookies, so they have 90 - 10 = 80 cookies left. 

The answer is 80."
"Let's say the triplet is x years old. The other triplet is also x years old because they are triplets. 

One twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so the other twin is x + 7 years old.

The total age of all of them is 44 years. So, we can write an equation: x + x + (x + 7) = 44

Combine like terms: 3x + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 37

Divide both sides by 3: x = 12.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we can use the whole number because we are looking for one of the twins. 

One twin is x + 7 years old, so one twin is 12.33 + 7 = 19.33."
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to know how many minutes he has in 3 hours. 

There are 60 minutes in 1 hour. So, 3 hours is 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20. We also know that each lollipop costs $0.40. 

To find out how much 1 lollipop costs, we can divide $3.20 by 5 lollipops. 

$3.20 ÷ 5 = $0.64 per lollipop. But we already know that each lollipop costs $0.40. This means that the price of 4 candies is $3.20 - $0.40 * 5. 

$3.20 - $0.40 * 5 = $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. 

So, 4 candies cost $1.20. To find out how much 1 candy costs, we can divide $1.20 by 4 candies. 

$1.20 ÷ 4 = $0.30 per candy.

Now, we know that 1 lollipop costs $0.40 and 1 candy costs $0.30. We need to find out how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost. 

10 lollipops will cost $0.40 * 10 = $4.00. 
10 candies will cost $0.30 * 10 = $3.00. 

So, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. 

Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. To find out how many coins Neil saves, we need to multiply 20 by 2/5. 

2/5 * 20 = 8

So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins every month.

Now, let's find out how many months are in 10 years. There are 12 months in a year.

10 years * 12 months/year = 120 months

Now, let's calculate the total coins saved by Rong in 120 months.

20 coins/month * 120 months = 2400 coins

Now, let's calculate the total coins saved by Neil in 120 months.

28 coins/month * 120 months = 3360 coins

Now, let's add the total coins saved by Rong and Neil.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20. 

2 x 20 = 40

So, the total cost of the vaccines is $40. 

Next, we need to find the cost of the heartworm check. It's 60% of the total bill. But we don't know the total bill yet. We know the total bill is the cost of the vaccines plus the cost of the heartworm check. 

Let's call the total bill ""x"". The cost of the heartworm check is 60% of x, which is 0.6x. 

The total bill is the cost of the vaccines plus the cost of the heartworm check. So, we can write an equation:

x = 40 + 0.6x

To solve for x, we need to get all the x terms on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 0.6x from both sides:

x - 0.6x = 40
0.4x = 40

Now, we need to get x by itself. We can do this by dividing both sides by 0.4:

x = 40 / 0.4
x = 100

So, the total bill is $100. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which is 0.6 x 100 = 60.

The total cost is the cost of the vaccines plus the cost of the heartworm check, which is 40 + 60 = 100.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much one banana costs. We know that one apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much as an apple. So, one banana costs 2 x $0.5 = $1.

Next, we need to find out how much one orange costs. We know that one orange costs three times as much as a banana. So, one orange costs 3 x $1 = $3.

Now, we know the cost of each fruit. We have 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges in a crate. 

The cost of 5 bananas is 5 x $1 = $5.
The cost of 12 apples is 12 x $0.5 = $6.
The cost of 7 oranges is 7 x $3 = $21.

Now, we add up the cost of all the fruits in the crate. $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"Let's break it down step by step.

We know that there are 14 red squares. 
There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.
There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.
There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, let's add up all the squares: 
14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

We need to know how many chairs are needed for 57 people. We need 1 high chair for every 1 baby, so we need 15 high chairs. We need 1 regular chair for every adult, so we need 42 regular chairs.

We already have 8 high chairs and 40 regular chairs. We need 15 high chairs and 42 regular chairs. So, we need 15 - 8 = 7 more high chairs and 42 - 40 = 2 more regular chairs.

"Bryce and four friends, that's 5 friends in total. Each pizza has 12 slices. 

Bryce and 2 friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. 2/3 of 12 is 8. So, Bryce and 2 friends ate 8 slices each. That's 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 slices.

The other 2 friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. ¾ of 12 is 9. So, the other 2 friends ate 9 slices each. That's 9 + 9 = 18 slices.

In total, 24 + 18 = 42 slices were eaten. There were 5 friends and each had a pizza, so there were 5 pizzas. Each pizza has 12 slices, so there were 5 x 12 = 60 slices in total.

60 - 42 = 18 slices left.

"The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. The dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the time the cat takes. 

First, we need to find out how long it takes the dog to eat the sausages. 2/3 of 30 minutes is 20 minutes. 

So, the dog eats 9 sausages in 20 minutes. 

To find the average time, we need to add the time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages and divide by 2. 

The cat takes 30 minutes and the dog takes 20 minutes. 

30 + 20 = 50 minutes. 

50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

The average time the two take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to convert Topher's shoe length from feet and inches to just inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 8 feet is 8 x 12 = 96 inches. Then we add the 4 inches, so Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches long.

Now, we know that Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's call the length of Bobby's shoe ""x"". Then, 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe is 9x. We know that Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9x, so we can write an equation: 9x + 10 = 100.

Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we'll subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 9x = 100 - 10, which is 9x = 90.

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 9 to find x: x = 90 / 9, which is x = 10.

So, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long."
"To find out how many windows Hannah smashes, we need to find out how many windows she smashes from the students' cars and the teachers' cars.

First, let's find out how many windows she smashes from the students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each. A quarter of the students' cars' windows are smashed. A quarter of 64 is 64 / 4 = 16. So, 16 students' cars' windows are smashed. Since each car has 4 windows, 16 x 4 = 64 windows are smashed from the students' cars.

Next, let's find out how many windows she smashes from the teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each. Three-fourths of the teachers' cars' windows are smashed. Three-fourths of 32 is 32 x 3/4 = 24. So, 24 teachers' cars' windows are smashed. Since each car has 2 windows, 24 x 2 = 48 windows are smashed from the teachers' cars.

Now, let's add the windows smashed from the students' cars and the teachers' cars. 64 + 48 = 112.

The final answer is: 112"
"To find the percent of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools, then divide by the total number of spools, and multiply by 100.

15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Now, let's add the number of light green and dark green spools: 
40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 90

Now, let's add the total number of spools: 
60 (blue) + 90 (green) = 150

Now, let's divide the number of blue spools by the total number of spools: 
60 / 150 = 0.4

Now, let's multiply by 100 to get the percent: 
0.4 * 100 = 40

At 8:00, 5000 people lined up. 

By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. 
2/5 of 5000 is 2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by midday. 
So, 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people were left to vote.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
2/3 of 3000 is 2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people voted by 16:00. 
So, 3000 - 2000 = 1000 people had not voted by 16:00.

The answer is 1000."
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to know how many pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days. 

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. 
So in 30 days, he will chew 4 x 30 = 120 pieces of gum.

A pack of gum has 15 pieces of gum. 
To find out how many packs Parker will need, we need to divide the total number of gum pieces he will chew (120) by the number of gum pieces in a pack (15).

120 ÷ 15 = 8

So Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."

9 kids want 2 smores each, so 9 x 2 = 18 smores. 
6 adults want 1 s'more each, so 6 x 1 = 6 smores. 
Now we add the smores the kids and adults want together, 18 + 6 = 24 smores. 

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we need to divide 24 by 8 to find out how many sleeves we need. 24 / 8 = 3. 

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide 3 by 3 to find out how many boxes we need. 3 / 3 = 1.

We know that the first house needs 1/2 of the second house. If we call the number of cases the second house needs ""x"", then the first house needs x/2 cases. 

The third house needs double the first house, so it needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases.

We know that the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. So, we can write an equation: x/2 + x + x = 250.

To solve for x, we need to combine like terms: x/2 + x + x = 3x/2. Now the equation is 3x/2 = 250.

To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply both sides by 2: 3x = 500.

Now we can divide both sides by 3 to find x: x = 500/3.

x = 166.67. But since we can't have a fraction of a case, we'll round down to 166 cases for the second house.

The first house needs 166/2 = 83 cases.

The third house needs double the first house, so it needs 2 * 83 = 166 cases.

The third house needs 166 cases of shingles.

He wants to make a total of $135. He already made $60 from selling eggplants. So, he needs to make 135 - 60 = 75 dollars from selling corn.

He has 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear for, we need to divide the total amount he needs to make from corn (75 dollars) by the number of ears of corn (25).

75 ÷ 25 = 3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3."
"First, we need to find out how many hours Tatiana has in total. She has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday. 

7 + 5 = 12 hours

She reads for 3 hours. 

12 - 3 = 9 hours left

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time. 

1/3 of 9 is 3. 

9 - 3 = 6 hours left for soccer

Now we need to find out what percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer. 

6 hours out of 12 hours is 6/12. 

6/12 can be simplified to 1/2. 

1/2 is 50%. 

The final answer is: 50"
"Anthony had 50 pencils. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. 1/2 of 50 is 25. So, he gave 25 pencils to Brandon. 

Now, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left. He gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. 3/5 of 25 is 15. So, he gave 15 pencils to Charlie.

Now, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left. 

The answer is: 10"
"To find out how long Jack is gone from home, we need to find out how long it takes him to drive there and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's find out how long it takes him to drive to the museum.  We know he drives 150 miles and his speed is 75 mph.  To find the time, we use the formula: time = distance / speed.

Time to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours.

Since he drives back home, it will take him the same amount of time, 2 hours.

So, the total time he spends driving is 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours.

Now, we add the time he spends at the museum, which is 6 hours.

Total time Jack is gone from home = 4 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many wheels Henry will need, we need to know how many wheels are needed for the cars and the motorcycles. 

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each car, and he has 57 cars. So, 4 x 57 = 228 wheels for the cars.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle, and he has 73 motorcycles. So, 2 x 73 = 146 wheels for the motorcycles.

Now, we need to add the wheels for the cars and the motorcycles. 228 + 146 = 374 wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left, we need to subtract the wheels he needs from the total number of wheels he has. 650 - 374 = 276.

The answer is 276."
"To find the discount, I need to multiply the price of the laptop by 20%. 

20% of 1000 is 0.2 x 1000 = 200.

Now, I need to subtract the discount from the price of the laptop. 

1000 - 200 = 800.

So, I have to pay $800."
"Let's break it down step by step.

Mike has 600 movies. A third of them are in series, so we need to find a third of 600.

A third of 600 is 600 / 3 = 200 movies in series.

These 200 movies can be bought for $6 each, but we need to find out how much a normal movie costs to compare. A normal movie costs $10.

So, 200 movies in series cost 200 x $6 = $1200.

Now, we need to find out how many movies are left. We already know 200 movies are in series, so we subtract that from 600.

600 - 200 = 400 movies left.

40% of these 400 movies are older movies, so we need to find 40% of 400.

40% of 400 is 0.4 x 400 = 160 movies.

These 160 movies are $5 each, so they cost 160 x $5 = $800.

Now, we need to find out how many normal movies are left. We already know 160 movies are older movies, so we subtract that from 400.

400 - 160 = 240 normal movies.

These 240 normal movies cost $10 each, so they cost 240 x $10 = $2400.

Now, we add up the costs of all the movies: $1200 (series) + $800 (older movies) + $2400 (normal movies) = $4400.

The final answer is: $4400"
"To find out how much Winston spent, we need to add up the cost of the peaches, plums, and apricots.

First, let's find the cost of the peaches: 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00

Next, let's find the cost of the plums: 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00

Then, let's find the cost of the apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, let's add up the costs: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

So, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit.

$38.00"
"They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. 50 x 6 = 300 miles. 

They hiked for 1.5 hours. 

First, we need to find out their hiking speed. They hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of 50 is 25. 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour. 

Now we know they hiked at 20 miles per hour. 20 x 1.5 = 30 miles. 

They drove 300 miles and hiked 30 miles. 300 + 30 = 330 miles. 

The answer is 330."
"Let's break it down step by step.

Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so let's say Emma jumps on x enemies. Then Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies.

Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so let's say Emma collects y berries. Then Ava collects y + 3 berries.

They both finish the level, but Ava finishes 4 seconds slower. This means Emma finishes the level 4 seconds earlier than Ava. Let's say the total time for the level is z seconds. Then Emma finishes the level in z - 4 seconds, and Ava finishes the level in z seconds.

The score for each enemy is 10 points, so Ava gets 10(x + 8) points for enemies and Emma gets 10x points for enemies.

The score for each berry is 5 points, so Ava gets 5(y + 3) points for berries and Emma gets 5y points for berries.

The score for each second is 30 points, so Emma gets 30(z - 4) points for time and Ava gets 30z points for time.

The total score for Ava is 10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30z.
The total score for Emma is 10x + 5y + 30(z - 4).

Now, let's simplify the total scores:

Ava's total score: 10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 30z = 10x + 5y + 30z + 95
Emma's total score: 10x + 5y + 30z - 120

Now, let's find the difference between their scores:

Difference = Ava's score - Emma's score
= (10x + 5y + 30z + 95) - (10x + 5y + 30z - 120)
= 10x + 5y + 30z + 95 - 10x - 5y - 30z + 120
= 95 + 120 - 5y
= 215 - 5y

We don't know the values of x, y, or z, but we can simplify the expression further. The difference between their scores is 215 - 5y."
"Let's break it down. 

We know that 2 pizzas cost 30 dollars. 

So, the cost of 2 pizzas is 30 dollars. 

We need to find the cost of the other 2 pizzas. 

The total cost of 4 pizzas is 64 dollars. 

So, the cost of the other 2 pizzas is 64 - 30 = 34 dollars. 

Since the other 2 pizzas cost the same amount, we need to divide 34 by 2 to find the cost of each pizza. 

34 / 2 = 17 

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars. 

The final answer is: 17"
"They ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. That's 3 x 5 = 15 times. 

They ride their bikes 2 times a day for 2 days. That's 2 x 2 = 4 times.

So, they ride their bikes 15 + 4 = 19 times in 7 days."
"Let's break it down step by step.

Bob had 7 fish in his pond. 3 were orange and 4 were white. 

He went to the pet store and got 17 fish. Let's say he got x white fish and y orange fish. 

Since he had 3 orange fish before and got y orange fish, he now has 3 + y orange fish. 

Since he had 4 white fish before and got x white fish, he now has 4 + x white fish.

We know that he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. So, we can write an equation: 3 + y = 2(4 + x)

We also know that the total number of fish he got from the pet store is 17. So, x + y = 17.

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y.

From the second equation, we can express y as y = 17 - x.

Substituting this into the first equation, we get: 3 + (17 - x) = 2(4 + x)

Simplifying the equation, we get: 20 - x = 8 + 2x

Combine like terms: 20 - x - 2x = 8

Combine like terms: 20 - 3x = 8

Subtract 20 from both sides: -3x = -12

Divide both sides by -3: x = 4

Now that we know x, we can find y: y = 17 - x = 17 - 4 = 13

But we want to know how many white fish Bob bought, so we need to find x. We already found that x = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to know how many miles he drives in a week and how much gas he uses.

He drives to work and back home every day from Monday to Friday, so that's 5 miles * 2 (to and from) = 10 miles per day. 

In a week, he drives 10 miles * 5 days = 50 miles.

Since his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, he uses 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons of gas per week.

The price of gas is $3 per gallon, so he spends 5 gallons * $3 = $15 per week on gas.

The answer is: $15"
"Carrie got 10 twenties. 3/5 of 10 twenties is 6 twenties. She spent 6 twenties. 

6 twenties is 6 x 20 = 120 dollars. 

She also got 140 quarters. She spent all the quarters. 140 quarters is 140 x 0.25 = 35 dollars. 

She spent 120 + 35 dollars. 120 + 35 = 155 dollars.

Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants. Each eggplant plant gives 4 eggplants. So, 8 x 4 = 32 eggplants.

Ricardo has 110 tomatoes and 32 eggplants. So, he has 110 + 32 = 142 fruits."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that one-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs. So, one-fourth of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 smart TVs.

Next, we know that one-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs. So, one-eighth of 40 is 40 / 8 = 5 analog TVs.

Now, we know that the rest of the TVs are OLED TVs. To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we need to subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs.

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 40 - 10 - 5 = 25.

$300 - $150 = $150. 

John is missing $150."
"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we need to know the temperature at night. 

It was 45 degrees during the day, and it's 33 degrees colder at night. So, we subtract 33 from 45 to find the temperature at night.

45 - 33 = 12 degrees

Now, we need to find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to get the temperature from 12 to 32 degrees. We know that each log heats the house up by 5 degrees.

To find out how many logs Carson needs, we divide the difference between the temperature we want (32) and the temperature at night (12) by the number of degrees each log heats the house up (5).

32 - 12 = 20 degrees

20 / 5 = 4

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

The answer is 4."
"To find out how many groups were made, we need to divide the total number of people by the number of people in each group. 

90 people / 9 people per group = 10 groups

Now, we need to find out how many groups had members bring back seashells. 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells. 

3/5 * 10 groups = 6 groups

Each group brought back 2 seashells. So, we need to multiply the number of groups that brought back seashells by the number of seashells each group brought back.

6 groups * 2 seashells per group = 12 seashells

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to find out how many employees the company has after three months and multiply it by the salary of each employee.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. 

After one month, the company has 200 + 20 = 220 employees.
After two months, the company has 220 + 20 = 240 employees.
After three months, the company has 240 + 20 = 260 employees.

Now, we multiply the total number of employees after three months by the salary of each employee.
Total employees after three months = 260
Salary per employee = $4000
Total amount of money = 260 * 4000 = $1040000

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary. So, Sally's starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Billy works 20 hours at $11.50 per hour, so he earns $11.50 * 20 = $230.

Sally works 20 hours at $10.50 per hour, so she earns $10.50 * 20 = $210.

Billy earns $230 - $210 = $20 more than Sally."

Let's say she buys x stuffed goats. 

The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x.

We want 30% of the total number of stuffed animals to be stuffed goats. 

So, 30% of (14 + x) = x

To find 30% of something, we multiply it by 0.3. 

0.3 * (14 + x) = x

Now, let's solve for x. 

0.3 * 14 + 0.3x = x

4.2 + 0.3x = x

Now, let's move 0.3x to the left side of the equation.

"Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that 340 out of 500 third-graders passed. To find the pass rate for third-graders, we divide the number of students who passed by the total number of students and multiply by 100.

Pass rate for third-graders = (340 / 500) * 100 = 68%

Next, we know that 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed. To find the pass rate for fourth-graders, we divide the number of students who passed by the total number of students and multiply by 100.

Pass rate for fourth-graders = (40 / 100) * 100 = 40%

We are also told that the pass rate for fifth-graders is twice the pass rate for fourth-graders. So, the pass rate for fifth-graders is 2 * 40% = 80%.

Now, we have the pass rates for all three grades: 68% for third-graders, 40% for fourth-graders, and 80% for fifth-graders.

To find the overall pass rate, we need to find the total number of students who passed and divide it by the total number of students.

Total number of students who passed = 340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + (400 * 80/100) (fifth-graders)
= 340 + 40 + 320
= 700

Total number of students = 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders)
= 1000

Now, we can find the overall pass rate.

Overall pass rate = (Total number of students who passed / Total number of students) * 100
= (700 / 1000) * 100
= 70%

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag has 72 chips. So, he has 2 x 72 = 144 chips.

It takes 12 chips to make one square inch. To find out how many inches Milo can make, we need to divide the total number of chips by 12.

144 chips / 12 chips per inch = 12 inches

So, Milo can make his mosaic 12 inches long."
"Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much tea the 4 students who drank 1.5 quarts each drank in total. 

4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts

Then, we need to find out how much tea the 16 students who drank 2 quarts each drank in total.

16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts

Now, we add the quarts drank by both groups of students to find the total quarts drank.

6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts

Since we know there are 10 quarts of tea left, we can add the quarts drank to the quarts left to find the total quarts of tea at the beginning of the party.

38 quarts (drank) + 10 quarts (left) = 48 quarts

Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts, we can convert the total quarts to gallons by dividing by 4.

48 quarts / 4 = 12 gallons

"Let's break it down step by step:

- At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.
- At the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 x 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 x 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 x 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 x 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 x 2 = 320 students.

To find the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, we need to subtract the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May:

320 - 10 = 310

So, 310 additional students would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year.

So, Felix climbed 420 branches in total. Since he worked during the week (5 days), we need to divide the total branches by 5 to find out how many branches he climbed per day.

420 ÷ 5 = 84

The answer is 84."
"Let's count the petals of each type of flower. 

First, she picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each. So, 3 x 5 = 15 petals.

Then, she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each. So, 4 x 6 = 24 petals.

Next, she picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each. So, 5 x 4 = 20 petals.

Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each. So, 6 x 7 = 42 petals.

Now, let's add all the petals together: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

But, she drops 1 of each flower, so we need to subtract 4 petals. 101 - 4 = 97 petals.

The answer is 97."
"Let's count the marshmallows first. John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so that's 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores. They dropped 3 marshmallows, so we need to subtract those from the total. 35 - 3 = 32 marshmallows left. 

Now, we need to divide the marshmallows left by 2 because there are 2 kids. 32 / 2 = 16."
"Let's break it down. 

Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter. His friends can play for half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes with 1 quarter. The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long, so he can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes with 1 quarter.

They play for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. 

Jack plays for 240 minutes. His friends play for 10 minutes each, so 2 friends play for 2 * 10 = 20 minutes. The better friend plays for 30 minutes. 

So, Jack plays for 240 minutes, and his friends play for 20 + 30 = 50 minutes. The total time is 240 + 50 = 290 minutes. 

Since Jack plays for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, the total quarters used by Jack is 290 / 20 = 14.5. The other two friends play for 10 minutes each with 1 quarter, so the total quarters used by them is 2 * 10 / 20 = 1. The better friend plays for 30 minutes with 1 quarter, so the total quarters used by him is 30 / 20 = 1.5. 

The total quarters used is 14.5 + 1 + 1.5 = 17. 

The answer is: 17"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

1. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance. 
2. She uses twice as much salt as citrus zest, so salt is 2 times zest.
3. She uses twice as much oil as salt, so oil is 2 times salt. 
4. Since salt is 2 times zest, oil is 2 times (2 times zest) = 4 times zest.
5. Since she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, oil is 4 times zest and also 4 times fragrance.
6. The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. 
7. Let's say zest (or fragrance) is x. 
8. Then, oil is 4x, salt is 2x, and sugar is 2x.
9. The total amount of the mixture is x + 4x + 2x + 2x = 9x.
10. Since the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, 9x = 10.
11. To find x, we need to divide both sides by 9. x = 10 / 9.
12. Since x is the amount of zest (or fragrance), and oil is 4 times x, the amount of oil is 4 * (10 / 9).

The final answer is: $\boxed{40/9}$"
"John buys 3 goats for $500 each. That's 3 x 500 = 1500 dollars.

"Paul already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. To find out how many more cupcakes he needs, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

First, let's add the number of chocolate and toffee cupcakes Paul already has: 8 + 40 = 48

Now, let's subtract 48 from the total number of cupcakes Paul needs: 63 - 48 = 15

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars. So Joe has 2 x 20 = 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 x 40 = 8. 

He gives away twice as many cars as he sold, so he gives away 2 x 8 = 16 cars.

Joe sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars. So he gave away a total of 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

Joe had 40 cars and gave away 24 cars. So he has 40 - 24 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much money the students raised in total. We know that the charity raised $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations. So, the students raised $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we know that 20 students raised $125,000 together. To find out how much each student raised, we need to divide the total amount by the number of students. 

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250.

So each student raised $6,250."
"Sandy walked 8 hours on the first day. 
On the second day, she walked half as many hours as the first day, so she walked 8 / 2 = 4 hours on the second day. 
To find the total time, we add the hours from both days: 8 + 4 = 12 hours. 
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 12 hours by 60 to get the total minutes: 12 * 60 = 720 minutes. 

The final answer is: 720"
"Let's break it down step by step.

1. Hunter counted 50 cars when he entered class.
2. Then, he counted 20 more cars during the first break. So, the total number of cars now is 50 + 20 = 70.
3. When he got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 of the cars had gone. This means 1/2 of 70 had left. To find 1/2 of 70, we divide 70 by 2. 70 / 2 = 35.
4. So, 35 cars had left. To find the number of cars that were still there, we subtract 35 from 70. 70 - 35 = 35.
5. But the question asks for the total number of cars he counted during lunch break. This means we need to add the cars that were still there to the cars that left. 35 (cars still there) + 35 (cars that left) = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"John does 30 cycles a day. Each cycle has 5 tasks. So, he does 30 x 5 = 150 tasks a day. Each task pays $1.20. So, he makes 150 x $1.20 = $180 a day. 

He works 7 days a week. So, he makes $180 x 7 = $1260 a week."
"Sasha scored 14 points in the first game. 

Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game.

Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game, so Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored, we add the points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food. Each package of cat food has 11 tins. So, she bought 8 x 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food. Each package of dog food has 6 tins. So, she bought 6 x 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we need to subtract the number of dog food tins from the number of cat food tins. 

88 (cat food tins) - 36 (dog food tins) = 52

The answer is 52."
"Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say PJ has x cards. 
Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341. So, we can write an equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have:
Smendrick has 3x = 3 * 47 = 141 cards
Becca has 3x + 12 = 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards

Cindy had 5 green eggs. 
She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had 5 x 2 = 10 blue eggs. 
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs. 
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and then subtract the refund she gets from Amazon.

The cost of shipping is $0.35 per pound and the book weighs 4 pounds. So, the cost of shipping is 4 x $0.35 = $1.40.

The book needs to be returned 20 miles away. The shipping company charges $0.08 per mile. So, the cost of shipping is 20 x $0.08 = $1.60.

The total cost of shipping is $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.99.

The book cost $32, but Amazon will only refund 75% of that. 75% of $32 is 0.75 x $32 = $24.

So, Milly will lose $2.99 (shipping cost) - $24 (refund) = -$21.71."

"Let's break it down step by step.

Boris produces 8,000 bars in the first week.

In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

So far, Boris has produced 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we need to find out how many bars he has left to produce in the fourth week.

50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars left to produce in the fourth week.

The answer is 14,000."
"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends each week and multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on TikTok each week:

- She records 18 videos, each 4 minutes long, so that's 18 x 4 = 72 minutes.
- She spends 2 hours writing songs, which is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes.
- She spends 15 minutes each day for 6 days, so that's 15 x 6 = 90 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time she spends on TikTok each week:
72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 282 minutes to hours:
282 / 60 = 4.7 hours

Now, let's multiply the time she spends on TikTok each week by 4 to find out how much time she spends in a month:
4.7 x 4 = 18.8 hours

The final answer is: 18.8"
"First, we need to find out how much the extra items will cost. Angela has 6 mirrors, but she already gets 4 mirrors in the package. So, she needs 6 - 4 = 2 more mirrors. 

She has 2 chandeliers, but she only gets 1 in the package. So, she needs 2 - 1 = 1 more chandelier.

She has 20 pictures, but she only gets 10 pictures in the package. So, she needs 20 - 10 = 10 more pictures.

The extra items she needs are 2 mirrors, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. That's a total of 2 + 1 + 10 = 13 items.

Each item costs $15.00 extra, so 13 items will cost 13 x $15.00 = $195.00.

The package costs $129.00. So, the total cost will be $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

Eva has saved $20.00. 
Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of $30.00, we multiply $30.00 by 0.4 (which is 40% as a decimal). 
$30.00 x 0.4 = $12.00. 
So, Roy has saved $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 * 1 = 12 inches. 
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches. 
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we need to convert 480 inches to feet. 
480 / 12 = 40 feet.

To get 25 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many cows are needed to give 25 - 15 = 10 liters of milk a day. 

Since each cow gives 5 liters of milk a day, we need to divide 10 by 5 to find out how many cows are needed. 10 / 5 = 2. 

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each used part and subtract it from the total length of the glue stick.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the used part is 5/6. 
5/6 of 12 millimeters is 10 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the used part is 1/3. 
1/3 of 12 millimeters is 4 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the used part is 1/2. 
1/2 of 12 millimeters is 6 millimeters.

Now, we add the used parts together: 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are used is 20 millimeters.

To find the length of the glue sticks that are not used, we subtract the used length from the total length: 
12 - 20 = -8 millimeters.

But, we can't have a negative length. This means that the glue sticks are shorter than the original length, so we need to find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used.

To do this, we need to find the length of each unused part and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the unused part is 1/6. 
1/6 of 12 millimeters is 2 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the unused part is 1/3. 
1/3 of 12 millimeters is 4 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the unused part is 1/2.

The sum of all our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87

Combine like terms: x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87

Combine x terms: 5x + 9 = 87

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78

Divide both sides by 5: x = 15.6

Since age can't be a decimal, I think there might be a mistake in the problem."
"Mr. Jackson wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. He has 27 students. So, he needs 27 x 2 = 54 glue sticks. 

The glue sticks come in packs of 8. To find out how many packs he needs, we need to divide 54 by 8. 

54 ÷ 8 = 6.75 

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks. 

7 packs of glue sticks will give him 7 x 8 = 56 glue sticks. 

He will have 56 - 54 = 2 glue sticks left over. 

The answer is 7."
"I think I know this. 

First, the water is 4000 gallons. Then it doubles, so it's 4000 x 2 = 8000 gallons. 

Then, it increases by 6000 gallons, so we add 6000 to 8000. 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

The answer is 14000."
"Let's count the people infected each day.

Day 1: 10 people are infected. They infect 6 others each, so 10 x 6 = 60. Now there are 10 + 60 = 70 people infected.

Day 2: 70 people are infected. They infect 6 others each, so 70 x 6 = 420. Now there are 70 + 420 = 490 people infected.

Day 3: 490 people are infected. They infect 6 others each, so 490 x 6 = 2940. Now there are 490 + 2940 = 3430 people infected.

The answer is: 3430"
"Rafaela got 40 * 20 = 800 dollars. 

Julieta got 10% less than Rafaela, so she got 90% of 800 dollars. 90% of 800 is 0.9 * 800 = 720 dollars.

Julieta and Rafaela got 720 + 800 = 1520 dollars altogether.

The final answer is: 1520"
"Jennifer gave her 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so she gave them 3 x 2 = 6 oranges. 

She gave her boy 3 oranges. 

So, she gave away 6 + 3 = 9 oranges. 

Jennifer bought 12 oranges and gave away 9 oranges. 

12 - 9 = 3 oranges. 

The answer is 3."
"Let's break it down step by step.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. 
Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge, so Amber earns 1/2 badge every month. 
Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire, so Wendy earns 3 badges every month.

In a year, there are 12 months. 
Claire earns 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges in a year.
Amber earns 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges in a year.
Wendy earns 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we need to subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns. 
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges.

The final answer is: 30"
"Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, that's 5 hours. She bakes 2 loaves per hour, so she baked 2 * 5 = 10 loaves. Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she has 10 * 8 = 80 slices. Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so she sold 80 * 50 cents. 

80 * 50 cents is 4000 cents. To change cents to dollars, we divide by 100. 4000 / 100 = 40. 

The answer is 40."
"Let's figure this out. 

Gretchen has 70 gold coins. We know there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So, to find out how many silver coins she has, we need to subtract 30 from 70. 

70 - 30 = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. 

Now, we need to find out the total number of coins. We have 70 gold coins and 40 silver coins. 

70 + 40 = 110

So, Gretchen has 110 coins in total."
"First, we need to find out how many burritos the students ate. There were 50 students and each student ate 10 burritos. 

50 students * 10 burritos = 500 burritos

Then, Mr. George ate 20 burritos. 

500 burritos (students ate) + 20 burritos (Mr. George ate) = 520 burritos

Now, we need to find out how many burritos were leftover. We know that there were 600 burritos in total. 

600 burritos (total) - 520 burritos (eaten) = 80 burritos

The answer is 80."
"Let's break it down step by step.

We know there are 12 red cars. 
They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so they have 3 x 10 = 30 blue cars.

We know the total number of cars is 75. We already know the number of red, green, and blue cars. Let's add them up: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

Now, we need to find out how many yellow cars there are. We know the total number of cars is 75, and we already know 52 of them are red, green, or blue. So, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

The answer is 23."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

We know that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books together. 

Let's say Anne has x books. Then Sofie has x + 25 books, and Fawn has x + 12 books.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can write an equation:

x + (x + 25) + (x + 12) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 37 = 85

Subtract 37 from both sides:

3x = 48

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 16

So Anne has 16 books. 

Since Fawn has 12 more books than Anne, Fawn has 16 + 12 = 28 books.

The answer is 28."
"Daisy bought a bag of potatoes that weighed 5 pounds. 
She bought a bag of sweet potatoes that weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes, so 2 x 5 = 10 pounds.
She bought a bag of carrots that weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The answer is 7."
"To find out how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to know how many jello cups he needs and how much each box costs.

First, we need to find out how many jello cups Greg needs.  There will be 30 kids and each kid will get 4 jello cups.  So, 30 kids * 4 jello cups = 120 jello cups.

Since each box of jello makes 10 jello cups, we need to find out how many boxes Greg needs.  120 jello cups / 10 jello cups per box = 12 boxes.

Now, we need to find out how much each box costs.  Each box costs $1.25.

To find out how much Greg will spend, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box.  12 boxes * $1.25 per box = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"The seller bought 5 phones for $700 each. So, the total cost of the phones is 5 x 700 = 3500 dollars.

The seller gave the seller $4000. To find the change, we need to subtract the cost of the phones from the $4000. 

Change = 4000 - 3500 = 500 dollars.

The final answer is: $500"
"Madeline pays 60% of the cost, so Keenan pays 100% - 60% = 40% of the cost. 

To find out how much Keenan pays per month, we need to find 40% of $400. 

40% of $400 is 0.4 x $400 = $160. 

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we need to divide $160 by 4 to find out how much Keenan pays per week.

$160 ÷ 4 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many pieces Tobias ate, we need to add the pieces he ate on each day.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. 2/5 of 60 is 2/5 x 60 = 24.

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces were left after the first two days. 60 - 24 - 10 = 26.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. 7/13 of 26 is 7/13 x 26 = 14.

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

Now, let's add the pieces he ate on each day. 24 + 10 + 14 = 48.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much one bottle of soda costs. We know 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00. 

To find the cost of one bottle of soda, we need to divide $21.00 by 7. 

$21.00 ÷ 7 = $3.00 per bottle of soda.

Now, we know that 4 bottles of water cost $8. 

To find the cost of one bottle of water, we need to divide $8 by 4. 

$8 ÷ 4 = $2.00 per bottle of water.

Now, David wants to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water. 

The cost of 3 bottles of soda is 3 x $3.00 = $9.00.

The cost of 2 bottles of water is 2 x $2.00 = $4.00.

So, the total cost will be $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

The final answer is: $13.00"

First, we need to find out how much the bolts cost in total. There are 16 bolts and each bolt costs $0.03. 

16 bolts * $0.03 = $0.48

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the bolts from the money David has. 

$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

So, David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts.

$12.00"
"Ella earns money for walking dogs. She earns $33 for 3 hours. To find out how much she earns per hour, we need to divide $33 by 3 hours. 

$33 ÷ 3 hours = $11 per hour

Now, we need to find out how much she earns in 12 hours. We multiply the amount she earns per hour by the number of hours she walks dogs. 

$11 per hour * 12 hours = $132

So, Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours of dog walking."
"Paul has 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 marbles. So now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.

"To find out how much money Isaias got from selling the chickens, we need to multiply the number of chickens he sold by the price per chicken. 

Isaias has 300 chickens and he plans to sell 3/5 of them. To find 3/5 of 300, we multiply 300 by 3 and then divide by 5.

300 * 3 = 900
900 / 5 = 180

So, Isaias sold 180 chickens.

Now, we multiply the number of chickens sold by the price per chicken to find the total money he got from selling the chickens.

180 * 50 = 9000

To find out how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to subtract the profit from the total money he got from selling the chickens.

Total money from selling chickens = 9000
Profit = 2000
Cost price of chickens = Total money from selling chickens - Profit
= 9000 - 2000

To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we need to subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold. 

14 (Julie) - 18 (Micah) is not correct because Micah sold 18 glasses. We need to change the subtraction to 18 (Micah) - 14 (Julie) is also not correct because we are trying to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah. 

So, we need to change the subtraction to 14 (Julie) - 18 (Micah) to 18 (Micah) - 14 (Julie) and change the sign to negative. 

18 (Micah) - 14 (Julie) = -4 

So, Julie sold 4 glasses more than Micah."

To find out how many years it will take for her age to be 24, we need to subtract 8 from 24. 24 - 8 = 16. 

So, it will take 16 years for her age to be 3 times her present age."
"Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total. So, one pack of bacon costs $10 / 5 = $2.

Now, we know that 6 packets of chicken cost twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, one packet of chicken costs $2 x 2 = $4.

Next, we know that 3 packs of strawberries cost $4 each. So, 3 packs of strawberries cost $4 x 3 = $12.

We also know that 7 packs of apples cost half the price of a pack of strawberries. So, one pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2. 7 packs of apples cost $2 x 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: 
- 5 packs of bacon: $10
- 6 packets of chicken: $4 x 6 = $24
- 3 packs of strawberries: $12
- 7 packs of apples: $14
Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60

"Let's break it down. 

Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts. This means if her usual concert is x minutes, the final concert is 2x minutes. 

The final concert is 65 minutes long and it includes a 15-minute encore. So, the concert itself is 65 - 15 = 50 minutes long. 

Since the concert itself is 2x, we can say 2x = 50. 

To find x, we need to divide both sides by 2. 

x = 50 / 2 
x = 25 

So, her usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

If she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, and she made $6 from Joe's lawn, then she made 3 times $6 from Kamala's lawn, which is 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

If she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, and she made $6 from Joe's lawn, then she made 5 times $6 from Alba's lawn, which is 5 x 6 = 30 dollars.

So, she made $6 from Joe's lawn, $18 from Kamala's lawn, and $30 from Alba's lawn. That's a total of $6 + $18 + $30 = $54 from mowing lawns.

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to know how much material she needs for small and large masks. 

For small masks, she needs 2 yards of material for 4 masks. To find out how much material she needs for 1 small mask, we divide 2 yards by 4 masks. 2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards per small mask. 

For large masks, she needs 2.25 yards of material for 3 masks. To find out how much material she needs for 1 large mask, we divide 2.25 yards by 3 masks. 2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards per large mask.

Now, we know that Jo needs 0.5 yards of material for 1 small mask and 0.75 yards of material for 1 large mask. 

To find out how much material she needs for 20 small masks, we multiply 20 small masks by 0.5 yards per small mask. 20 * 0.5 = 10 yards.

To find out how much material she needs for 8 large masks, we multiply 8 large masks by 0.75 yards per large mask. 8 * 0.75 = 6 yards.

She spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we need to divide the total amount she spent by the number of tickets she bought.

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

The final answer is: $8"
"Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. 
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours a day. 
He walks his dog for 1 hour a day. 
So, he is busy for 8 + 1 = 9 hours a day. 
There are 24 hours in a day. 
So, Harold has 24 - 9 = 15 hours of free time in a day.

"Tim has 7 blue shoe boxes. He uses 3 blue shoe boxes. So, he has 7 - 3 = 4 blue shoe boxes left.

He has 9 red shoe boxes. He uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes. 1/3 of 9 is 9 / 3 = 3. So, he uses 3 red shoe boxes. He has 9 - 3 = 6 red shoe boxes left.

So, Tim has 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left.

4 + 6 = 10"
"Joseph has twice the number of Sarah's books, so he has 2 x 9 = 18 books.

"Dean has 30 marbles. He gives 1/5 of them to Jamie. 1/5 of 30 is 6. So Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie. 

Now Dean has 30 - 6 = 24 marbles. 

Then Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald. 

Now Dean has 24 - 10 = 14 marbles.

The answer is 14."
"Let's break it down step by step.

Duncan's age eight years ago was 60 - 8 = 52.

Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, Adam's age four years ago was 52 / 2 = 26.

Adam's current age is 26 + 4 = 30.

In 8 years, Adam will be 30 + 8 = 38.

"Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that. Twice 200 is 400. 100 more than 400 is 500. 

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres. 

To find the total acres of both farms, we add 200 and 500. 

200 + 500 = 700 

The answer is 700."
"Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour. 

In an 8-hour workday, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages. 

He gets paid $0.20 for every package, so he earns 320 * 0.20 = $64. 

The final answer is $64."
"John drinks a bottle of water every half hour. That means he drinks 2 bottles in 1 hour. 

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, so it's 45/60 = 0.75 hours. 

An extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so it's 4 x 0.75 = 3 hours. 

3 hours is 3 x 2 = 6 hours. 

So, John drinks 6 x 2 = 12 bottles of water in that time.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon. 

We know that 20 of the balloons were red. So, the total bologna thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

We also know that the total bologna thrown at all the balloons is 58. 

So, the bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons is 18 / 3 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to know how many miles he drives in 30 days. 

He drives 100 miles a day for 30 days. 

100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Now we need to find out how many 1000 mile blocks are in 3000 miles. 

3000 miles / 1000 miles = 3

So Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday. 
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 5 x 2 = 10 hours on Wednesday. 
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours on Thursday. 
To find the total hours, we add the hours he works on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.

"Let's break it down step by step.

They bought a cake for $11. 
They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. They were sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons. So, 12 balloons will cost 12 / 2 * 0.5 = 3 dollars. 
They bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so that's 2 * 7 = 14 dollars. 
The total money they spent is 11 + 3 + 14 = 28 dollars. 
They spent all the money they had, so the total money they had is 28 dollars.

Now, we add the students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer. 
6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

The final answer is 56."
"To find the total money the class raised, we need to find out how much money they made from selling lollipops and then subtract the cost of the lollipops.

First, let's find out how much money each student made from selling lollipops. Each student sold 10 lollipops at $0.8 each. 

10 lollipops * $0.8 per lollipop = $8

Since there are 30 students, we multiply the money each student made by 30.

$8 * 30 = $240

Now, we need to find out how much money the class spent on buying lollipops. They bought 30 lollipops at $0.5 each.

30 lollipops * $0.5 per lollipop = $15

Now, we subtract the cost from the money they made to find the profit.

$240 - $15 = $225

The class was able to raise $225 from the profit of selling lollipops.

"Larry has 3 cats. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to add the number of cats, dogs, rabbits, fish, and gerbils together: 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47.

"Martha collects 1 shell every month. To find out how many shells she has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to count the months from her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday.

From 5 to 10 years old, there are 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 5 years by 12 months.

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects 1 shell every month, we multiply the total months by 1 shell/month.

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

So, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

"Let's break this down. The sloth eats berries for 8 hours. He eats berries for 4 hours in total, because it takes him 4 hours to go down, pick berries, and go back up. 

If he eats berries for 4 hours, and he wants to collect 24 berries, then he picks 24 berries in 4 hours. 

To find out how many berries he picks per hour, we divide 24 by 4. 24 / 4 = 6. 

So, the sloth picks 6 berries per hour. 

Now, we need to find out how many berries he picks in 8 hours. We multiply 6 by 8. 6 * 8 = 48. 

But we already know he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. So, we need to find out how many berries he picks per trip. 

We know he picks 48 berries in 8 hours, but he only wants 24 berries. So, we divide 48 by 2. 48 / 2 = 24. 

But we are looking for the least number of berries he can pick per trip. We know he picks 6 berries per hour. If he picks 6 berries per hour, and it takes him 4 hours to go down, pick berries, and go back up, then he picks 6 * 4 = 24 berries per trip. 

So, the least number of berries he can pick per trip is 6."

They use water from the tank to water their vegetable garden, but we don't know how much they used. We only know how much water is taken out of the tank each day, which is 500 gallons. 

To find out how much water is left after 6 days, we need to subtract the water taken out from the tank from the initial amount of water in the tank. 

5000 gallons (initial water in the tank) - 500 gallons (water taken out per day) * 6 days = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

- 4 boxes of candy: 4 x $2 = $8

Total money spent so far: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Colby has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

He wants to see movies on the last day of the month, which is a Friday. Each movie ticket costs $10. He also wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy, which costs $8 + $2 = $10.

Colby has $20 left, so he can buy 1 movie ticket ($10) and 1 popcorn and 1 box of candy ($10) with the remaining money.

He can see 1 more movie on the last day of the month.

"To find the calories of the mini pastries, we need to find the calories of one mini pastry first. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so it has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so it has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we need to find the total calories of all the mini pastries. There are 200 mini cinnamon rolls and each has 200 calories. So, the total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls are 200 x 200 = 40000 calories.

There are 300 mini blueberry muffins and each has 150 calories. So, the total calories of the mini blueberry muffins are 300 x 150 = 45000 calories.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet. So, the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 x 12 = 420 feet.

Now, we add the total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney: 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

To find the average, we divide the total distance spat by the total number of seeds spat. The total number of seeds spat is 40 + 35 = 75.

First, we find out how long it took James to swim 60% of the distance. 60% of 20 miles is 0.6 x 20 = 12 miles. 

Since James swims at 2 miles per hour, it took him 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours to swim 12 miles.

Then, he rested for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, he has to swim the remaining 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. But he swims at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

So, it took him 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours to swim the remaining distance.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo. 
Let's say Azibo scored x points. 
Then Bahati scored x + 20 points. 

Bahati also scored 10 more points than Dinar. 
Let's say Dinar scored y points. 
Then Bahati scored y + 10 points. 

We know that Bahati scored x + 20 points and y + 10 points are the same. 
So, we can say x + 20 = y + 10. 

We also know that Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar together scored 45 points. 
So, we can say (x + 20) + x + y = 45. 

Now we have two equations: 
1) x + 20 = y + 10 
2) 2x + y = 25 

From equation 1, we can say y = x + 10. 
Now we can substitute y in equation 2: 
2x + (x + 10) = 25 
Combine like terms: 
3x + 10 = 25 
Subtract 10 from both sides: 
3x = 15 
Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 5 

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

She went to sleep at 10 p.m. and woke up at 5:55 a.m. So, she slept from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. That's 7 hours and 55 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 7 hours is 7 x 60 = 420 minutes. 55 minutes is 55 minutes. So, she slept 420 + 55 = 475 minutes.

Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. That's 23 minutes.

To find out how many minutes she slept on her bed, we need to subtract the minutes she was sleepwalking and the minutes she woke up earlier. So, 475 - 23 - 5 = 447 minutes.

The final answer is: 447"
"Jonathan has 2 dozen cups. 1 dozen is 12, so 2 dozen is 2 x 12 = 24 cups.

Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. So he has 2/3 x 24 = 16 spoons.

Jonathan gave Pedro 6 spoons. So he has 16 - 6 = 10 spoons left.

Jonathan has 24 cups and 10 spoons. So he has 24 + 10 = 34 utensils."
"To find the number of occupied beds, we need to multiply the total capacity by 1/5. 

1000 * 1/5 = 200

So, 200 beds are occupied. 

Now, we need to find out how many patients will be admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks will have 14 days. 

50 patients are admitted each day, so in 14 days, 50 * 14 = 700 patients will be admitted.

Now, we need to add the number of occupied beds and the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. 

200 (initial occupied beds) + 700 (patients admitted in 2 weeks) = 900

Now, we need to find the number of unoccupied beds. 

Total capacity is 1000, and 900 beds are occupied. 

1000 - 900 = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's break it down step by step.

Robyn sends 16 emails a day. 7 are work emails. 

16 - 7 = 9 emails left.

Two-thirds of the remainder are to family. Two-thirds of 9 is 6. 

9 - 6 = 3 emails left.

One-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is 1.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old. So Shawna is 3 x 3 = 9 years old.

Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, and Shawna is 9 years old. So Shawna's father is 5 x 9 = 45 years old.

The final answer is 45."
"Let's say the real number of people who attended the concert is x.

Since Kelly said Courtney overstated the number by 20%, that means Courtney said there were 120% of the real number of people (100% + 20% more).

We know Courtney said there were 48 people, so 120% of x is 48.

To find x, we can set up the equation: 1.2x = 48

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 1.2:

x = 48 / 1.2
x = 40

So, the real number of people who attended the concert is 40.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Jason carried 2 balls. 
Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball. 
Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried 2 x 2 = 4 balls. 

Now, we add up the number of balls each boy carried: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls. 

The total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"Let's break it down step by step.

The pirates dug 10 holes the first day. 

The second day, they dug 13 holes. So, the total number of holes after the second day is 10 + 13 = 23 holes.

The third day, they dug 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes. So, the total number of holes after the third day is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Four times the number of holes at the end of the first day is 4 x 10 = 40 holes.

So, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 40. We already know that there were 29 holes at the end of the third day. 

To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to subtract the number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day. 

40 - 29 = 11 holes.

The pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

"Let's say the number of corn chips Amora and Lainey got is x. 

Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so x = 70.

Now, we know Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

The total number of corn chips is the sum of what Amora, Lainey, and Collins got. 

Total = x + x + (x + 15)
Total = 70 + 70 + 85
Total = 225

The final answer is: 225"
"Jen has to pay $400 for supplies. The travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. 

50% of $400 is 0.5 x 400 = 200. 

So, the travel tickets cost $400 + $200 = $600."
"Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Adelwolfe has caught x Pokemon.

Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, so Stan has caught 4x - 13 Pokemon.

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught (4x - 13) + 5 Pokemon.

Together they have caught 339 Pokemon, so we can write an equation:

x + (4x - 13) + ((4x - 13) + 5) = 339

Combine like terms:

x + 4x - 13 + 4x - 13 + 5 = 339

Combine x terms:

9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:

9x = 360

Divide both sides by 9:

x = 40

So Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon.

Stan has caught 4x - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 Pokemon.

The final answer is: 147"
"Let's break it down. 

Each episode is 20 minutes long. 
There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 
So, if there are 20 minutes per episode, then there are 20 / 2 = 10 episodes. 

Now, we need to find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show. 
To do that, we need to multiply the number of episodes by the number of minutes per episode. 
So, 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

"The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour.  To find the distance, we multiply 10 hours by 30 miles per hour.  10 x 30 = 300 miles.  

Then, the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour.  To find the distance, we multiply 2 hours by 18 miles per hour.  2 x 18 = 36 miles.  

Since the bird flew south for 300 miles and then north for 36 miles, we need to subtract 36 miles from 300 miles to find the distance the bird actually traveled south.  300 - 36 = 264 miles.

Then, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour.  To find the distance, we multiply 5 hours by 22 miles per hour.  5 x 22 = 110 miles.

Now, we add the distance the bird traveled south the first time (264 miles) to the distance the bird traveled south the last time (110 miles).  264 + 110 = 374 miles.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. 25% of 8 is 8 x 25/100 = 2. So Nani's sister is 8 - 2 = 6 years old.

The total age of all three family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years."
"To find out how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for each type of string and then add them up.

For synthetic gut, it takes 15 minutes per racquet and there are 3 racquets. So, 3 x 15 = 45 minutes.

For polyester string, it takes 22 minutes per racquet and there are 5 racquets. So, 5 x 22 = 110 minutes.

For hybrid sets, it takes 18 minutes per racquet and there are 4 racquets. So, 4 x 18 = 72 minutes.

Now, we add up all the minutes: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

"To find out how many wooden slats Robert will need, we need to find out how many feet of fencing he will build. 

The garden is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide. To find the total length of the fencing, we need to add the length and the width together, and then multiply by 2 because there are two sides of each length and width. 

So, 15 + 10 = 25. Then, 25 x 2 = 50. 

But we also need to add the two other sides of the same length. So, 50 + 15 + 10 = 75. 

Now, we need to find out how many slats Robert will need. He needs 2 slats for every foot of fencing. So, we multiply 75 by 2. 

75 x 2 = 150.

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each. That's 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. Each box has 20 oranges. So, she gave away 4 x 20 = 80 oranges.

She kept 1/4 of the oranges. 1/4 of 240 is 240 / 4 = 60 oranges.

She gave away 80 oranges and kept 60 oranges. So, she has 240 - 80 - 60 = 100 oranges left to sell.

Tyler already has $14, so he needs to earn $39 - $14 = $25 more.

Since he earns $5 per hour, we can find out how many hours he needs to work by dividing the amount he needs to earn ($25) by his hourly wage ($5):
$25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours

Robert has 30 cherries. He has 10 more than Richard. So, Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

Now, we know that Robert and Richard together have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries. 

Since they have 50 cherries together, and there are 60 cherries in total, Jerry must have 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.

Now, we know that Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries. To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we need to subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has. 

30 - 10 = 20

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry."
"Let's break it down step by step.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. 
On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. 
On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both days:
- Gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
- Apple pie: 11 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 26 boxes

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Sunny earned from selling gingerbread:
25 boxes * $6 per box = $150

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Sunny earned from selling apple pie:

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Emil is 19 now. When he turns 24, he will be 24 - 19 = 5 years older. 

When Emil turns 24, his dad will be half his age, so his dad's age will be 24 / 2 = 12 years older than Emil's age at that time. 

So, his dad's age when Emil turns 24 will be 24 + 12 = 36 years old. 

Now, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. So, his brother's age at that time will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old. 

Now, we need to find out their current ages. Emil's current age is 19, and his brother's current age is 12 - 5 = 7 years old. 

His dad's current age is 36 - 5 = 31 years old.

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to know the total space she has for plants. 

First, we need to find out how much space Pat needs to leave between the plants. 1.5 feet is the same as 18 inches. 

Now, let's find out the total space Pat has for plants. The flower bed is 111 feet long. We need to convert this to inches. 1 foot is 12 inches, so 111 feet is 111 x 12 = 1332 inches. 

Now, let's find out the total space Pat needs for plants and the space between the plants. We know that Pat has 17 flowers already, so we need to find out how many more flowers she needs. Let's call this number x. The total number of flowers will be 17 + x. 

The total space for plants and the space between the plants is 1332 inches. Each plant takes 12 inches of space, and each space between the plants takes 18 inches of space. So, the total space for plants and the space between the plants is 12x + 18x. 

We know that the total space for plants and the space between the plants is 1332 inches. So, we can write an equation: 12x + 18x = 1332. 

Combine like terms: 30x = 1332. 

Now, divide both sides by 30: x = 1332 / 30 = 44.4. 

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. So, Pat needs 44 more flowers. 

Now, let's find out the total number of flowers Pat needs. Pat already has 17 flowers, and she needs 44 more flowers. So, the total number of flowers Pat needs is 17 + 44 = 61 flowers. 

Now, let's find out how much money Pat will spend at the store. Each flower costs $6, and Pat needs 61 flowers. So, the total cost will be 6 x 61 = $366.

The cost of 2 sweet potato vines is 2 x $2.50 = $5.00

The total cost for one basket is $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00

Now, we multiply the cost of one basket by 5 to find the total cost for all 5 baskets.
$14.00 x 5 = $70.00

So, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets."

Now, let's add the number of shrimp she can peel and cook in one minute. 6 (peeled shrimp) + 3 (cooked shrimp) = 9 shrimp per minute.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take her to peel and cook 90 shrimp. 90 shrimp / 9 shrimp per minute = 10 minutes.

So, it will take Emily 10 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp."

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. The room warms up 2 degrees an hour when the air conditioner is not running.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

Then it was turned up to high for 4 hours, so it cooled the room 3 * 4 = 12 degrees.

So, in total, the air conditioner cooled the room 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

The air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, so the room warmed up 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

So, the total change in temperature is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature."

Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. 

Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. 

So, Bill was 3 x 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the time between the two sightings is 75 years.

To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to subtract 75 from 90.

90 - 75 = 15

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The first plane goes to Greece for 3/4 of its flights, and the remaining flights are split between France and Germany. So, the first plane goes to Greece for 3/4 of its flights, and 1/4 of its flights are split between France and Germany. 

Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the first plane goes to France for 1/4 of its flights and to Germany for 1/4 of its flights.

The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 trips.

Now, we know the first plane makes 88 trips in a day. It goes to Greece for 3/4 of its flights, which is 3/4 * 88 = 66 trips. 

The remaining flights are split between France and Germany, which is 1/4 of 88 = 22 trips. Since the first plane goes to France for 1/4 of its flights, it goes to France for 22 trips.

We know that the total age of the children is 20. We also know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. 

So, the total age of Akbar and Alessandro is 3 + 4 = 7.

Now, we subtract the total age of Akbar and Alessandro from the total age of all children to find the total age of Helene and Wilfred. 
20 - 7 = 13

We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's call the average age 'x'. Then Helene's age is 2x.

The total age of the group is 20, so the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, Helene's age is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we know that the total age of Helene and Wilfred is 13. We also know that Helene is 10 years old. So, Wilfred's age is 13 - 10 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from a fund he set up online. So, he collected $500 + $1500 = $2000. 

Then, his friend gives him $200. So, now Walter has $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. So, he will donate 3 * $2200 = $6600."
"There were 100 guests at the wedding. Each guest brought 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is 100 x 15 = 1500 cookies.

The bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. 1/2 of 1500 is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we need to divide the number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got. 

So, 750 / 15 = 50 people. 

The answer is 50."
"Let's say the size of a kid's slice is x. 

Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of an adult's slice is 2x.

There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6.

The total size of the watermelon is the sum of the sizes of all the slices. 

The total size of the kids' slices is 4x (4 kids * x). 
The total size of the adults' slices is 2x * 2 = 4x (2 adults * 2x).

The total size of the watermelon is 4x + 4x = 8x.

Each adult gets 4x out of 8x, which is half of the watermelon.

To find the percentage, we multiply 0.5 by 100.

0.5 * 100 = 50

So each adult gets 50% of the watermelon."
"Doctor Jones has to do rounds for 9 inpatients. Each round takes 20 minutes. So, he will spend 9 x 20 = 180 minutes on rounds. 

There are 60 minutes in 1 hour. So, 180 minutes is 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

Doctor Jones has 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes. So, he will spend 10 x 30 = 300 minutes on appointments. 

There are 60 minutes in 1 hour. So, 300 minutes is 300 / 60 = 5 hours.

Doctor Jones works 9 hours at the clinic. He will spend 3 hours on rounds and 5 hours on appointments. So, he will spend 3 + 5 = 8 hours on rounds and appointments.

So, he will have 9 - 8 = 1 hour left to update his records.

"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up all the time it takes to make the cake. 

First, we add the time to make the cake batter and bake the cake: 20 minutes + 30 minutes = 50 minutes.

Then, we add the time it takes to cool the cake: 50 minutes + 2 hours = 50 minutes + 120 minutes = 170 minutes.

Now, we convert 2 hours to minutes to make it easier to add: 2 hours = 120 minutes.

Now we add the time to frost the cake: 170 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours.

Now we add the 3 hours to the time we want to serve the cake: 5:00 pm + 3 hours = 8:00 pm.

So, Jordan should start making the cake at 8:00 am to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

The final answer is 8:00."
"Let's say there are x chocolate bars in a box. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We know they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so 8x = 64. 

To find x, we need to divide both sides by 8. 
x = 64 / 8 
x = 8 

The answer is: 8"
"To find the earnings of the dance studio, we need to know how much they earn per session and how many sessions they have in a month.

First, let's find out how much they earn per session. They charge $25 to rent the studio and $1.50 per student. They have 10 students, so they earn $1.50 x 10 = $15 per session from the students. 

So, the total earnings per session is $25 (rent) + $15 (students) = $40.

They rent the studio 3 days a week. There are 4 weeks in a month, so they rent the studio 3 x 4 = 12 days a month.

Now, we need to find out how many sessions they have in a month. Since they rent the studio 12 days a month, and each session is 1 day, they have 12 sessions in a month.

Now, we can find the total earnings of the dance studio in a month. They earn $40 per session and have 12 sessions in a month, so their total earnings are $40 x 12 = $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's say Peter has x chocolate bars in each box. Since he has 4 boxes, he has 4x chocolate bars in total. We know that Peter has 64 chocolate bars in total, so we can write an equation:

4x = 64

To find x, we divide both sides by 4:

x = 64 / 4
x = 16

So Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, let's do the same for Martha. Let's say Martha has y chocolate bars in each box. Since she has 7 boxes, she has 7y chocolate bars in total. We know that Martha has 56 chocolate bars in total, so we can write an equation:

7y = 56

To find y, we divide both sides by 7:

y = 56 / 7
y = 8

So Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. We can do this by subtracting the number of chocolate bars Martha has in each box from the number of chocolate bars Peter has in each box:

16 - 8 = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many female porcupines there are. We know that the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population. 

3/5 of 50 is 3 x 10 = 30. So, there are 30 female porcupines.

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. There are 12 months in a year, so each female porcupine will give birth to 4 x 12 = 48 babies in a year.

Now, we need to find out how many babies will be born in total. Since there are 30 female porcupines, and each gives birth to 48 babies, the total number of babies will be 30 x 48 = 1440.

Now, we add the number of babies to the initial population of porcupines. The initial population is 50, and 1440 babies will be born, so the total population will be 50 + 1440 = 1490.

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width x length x depth
Volume = 14 x 25 x 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Now, we need to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find out how many gallons of water they need.

Gallons = Volume x 5.9
Gallons = 1400 x 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon.

Cost = Gallons x cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 x 0.10
Cost = 826

The cost to fill the pool is $826."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

We know there are 9 red sticks. 
There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so we add 5 to 9 to get the number of blue sticks: 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.
The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so we subtract 3 from 14 to get the number of yellow sticks: 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.

Now, we add up the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks to get the total number of sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

"To find out how far Matteo traveled, we need to multiply his speed by the time he traveled. 

Matteo's speed is 55 miles per hour and he traveled for 4 hours. 
55 x 4 = 220 miles

To find out how far Shandy traveled, we need to multiply his speed by the time he traveled. 

Shandy's speed is 45 miles per hour and he traveled for 10 hours. 
45 x 10 = 450 miles

Now, we need to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo. 
We do this by subtracting the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled. 
450 - 220 = 230 miles

The answer is 230."
"Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. So, half of 3000 is 3000 / 2 = 1500 students are over 16 years old.

Then, one-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male. So, one-fourth of 1500 is 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16 years old.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. So, half of 3000 is 3000 / 2 = 1500 students are under 16 years old.

One-half of the students under 16 are male. So, one-half of 1500 is 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16 years old.

Now, let's find out how many students are female. We know that 375 students over 16 are male, and 750 students under 16 are male. So, the total number of male students is 375 + 750 = 1125.

We know that there are 3000 students in total. So, the number of female students is 3000 - 1125 = 1875.

"Let's break it down step by step.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. 

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run. 

10 (Bethany) - 5 (Quinn) = 5

"Let's break it down step by step.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 x 18000 = 4500 gallons. 

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 x 4500 = 3375 gallons.

So, on the first day, the total amount of water in the tank is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 x 4500 = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 x 3375 = 1125 gallons.

So, on the second day, the total amount of water in the tank is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water in the tank after two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the total capacity of the power bank is 100%. 

First, Maria's power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour for 5 hours. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be 100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%.

Then, for the next 3 hours, the power bank was losing 7% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be 55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%.

But we know that the charge remaining at the end was 28%. So, we need to find out how much charge was remaining after 5 hours, and then we can find the initial charge.

Let's say the charge remaining after 5 hours is x%. Then, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be x% - (7% * 3) = 28%. 

x% - 21% = 28%
x% = 28% + 21% = 49%

So, the charge remaining after 5 hours was 49%. 

Now, we know that after 5 hours, the charge remaining was 49%, which is 55% - 6%. So, the power bank was losing 6% of the total capacity each hour for 5 hours.

Let's find the initial charge. Let's say the initial charge is y%. Then, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be y% - (6% * 5) = 49%.

y% - 30% = 49%
y% = 49% + 30% = 79%

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 79%."

5 apples cost 5 x $.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add all the money Jamaar spent. $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9

Jamaar started with $10. He spent $9, so he has $10 - $9 = $1 left.

Plums cost $.25 each. To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to divide the money he has left by the cost of one plum. $1 / $.25 = 4

Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Price of carrots = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 x $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Price of carrots = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 x $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

The price of carrots after three years is $139."

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. So, 2 x 15 = 30 people checked in.

Now we add the 30 people who checked in to the 76 people who are still in the hotel: 76 + 30 = 106.

7 more people checked in after dinner, so we add 7 to 106: 106 + 7 = 113.

"First, we need to find out how many easy, average, and difficult questions there are. 

40% of 60 is easy questions. To find 40% of 60, we multiply 60 by 0.4. 
60 x 0.4 = 24 easy questions.

Since the rest of the questions are equally divided as average and difficult, we divide the remaining questions by 2. 
60 - 24 = 36 questions left. 
36 / 2 = 18 average and difficult questions. 

So, there are 24 easy questions, 18 average questions, and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions. To find 75% of 24, we multiply 24 by 0.75. 
24 x 0.75 = 18 easy questions.

Aries is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions. To find half of 18, we divide 18 by 2. 
18 / 2 = 9 average and difficult questions.

Now, we add the questions Aries is sure to get. 
18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36

"Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of small stuffed animals sold is x. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of large stuffed animals sold is x/2.

The price of a small stuffed animal is $4. So, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one, which is 3 x $4 = $12.

The total amount earned from selling small stuffed animals is 4x (since each small stuffed animal costs $4 and x of them were sold). The total amount earned from selling large stuffed animals is 12(x/2) = 6x (since each large stuffed animal costs $12 and x/2 of them were sold).

The total amount earned from both small and large stuffed animals is $120. So, we can write the equation: 4x + 6x = 120.

Combine like terms: 10x = 120.

Divide both sides by 10: x = 12.

So, the number of small stuffed animals she sold is 12."

"Let's break it down step by step.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 

With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 is 12, so he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, we know that 1 dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. 

We have 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes, so they can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

There are 30 days in a month, so they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore in a month.

First, there's a 50% chance that the substitute teacher won't collect the homework. If that happens, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework. 

The other 50% chance is that the normal teacher will come in. If that happens, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. If that happens, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework. 

So, if the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance Marcus won't have to turn in his homework. 

But if the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. This means there's a 60% chance (100% - 40%) that the normal teacher won't give him an extension. 

So, if the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance Marcus won't have to turn in his homework, and a 60% chance he won't get an extension. 

Now, let's calculate the chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework if the normal teacher comes in. This is 60% (chance of no extension) x 50% (chance of normal teacher coming in) = 30%.

Now, let's add the chance that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework if the substitute teacher comes in (50%) to the chance that he won't have to turn in his homework if the normal teacher comes in (30%). 

50% + 30% = 80%. 

So, there's an 80% chance that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework. 

To find the chance that he will have to turn in his homework, we subtract 80% from 100%. 

100% - 80% = 20%.

8 bottles * 5 seconds per bottle = 40 seconds

The final answer is: 40"
"Uncle Franky has 2 boxes of apples. Each box has 40 apples. So, he has 2 x 40 = 80 apples. He wants to pack 8 apples in one pack. To find out how many packs he can make, we need to divide the total number of apples by 8. 

80 ÷ 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples."
"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought. 

2 pounds of Parmesan cheese costs 2 x $11 = $22. 
3 pounds of mozzarella cheese costs 3 x $6 = $18. 
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40. 

Amor starts with $50. So, after buying the cheese, she will have $50 - $40 = $10 left. 

The final answer is: $10"
"Let's break it down step by step.

Jim gets $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years. So, the total amount of loans he gets is 50,000 * 4 = 200,000 dollars.

He also lost money from not working while in school. He had a 25,000 dollar a year job, so for 4 years, he lost 25,000 * 4 = 100,000 dollars.

So, in total, he needs to earn 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 dollars.

His college degree tripled his income, so now he makes 3 * 25,000 = 75,000 dollars per year.

To find out how long it will take him to earn 300,000 dollars, we need to divide 300,000 by 75,000.

300,000 / 75,000 = 4 years.

So, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To find out how much fabric Jim needs, we need to find the area of the fabric pieces. 

First, we need to find the size of the fabric pieces. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. We need to add 2 feet to the length and width. 

Length: 6 + 2 = 8 feet
Width: 8 + 2 = 10 feet

Now we have the size of the fabric pieces: 8 feet by 10 feet. 

To find the area, we multiply the length and width. 

Area = length * width
Area = 8 * 10
Area = 80

So, Jim needs 80 square feet of fabric."
"Let's break it down step by step.

On Monday, they delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 x 2 = 204. 
So, they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters on Wednesday.

Now, let's add the letters delivered on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 
425 + 102 + 209 = 736

The final answer is: 736"
"To find the total amount Molly will pay, we need to find out how much the chicken salad costs and how much the pasta salad costs, then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken salad. 10 people want the chicken salad and it costs $6.50 per person. So, 10 x 6.50 = 65 dollars.

Next, let's find the cost of the pasta salad. 6 people want the pasta salad and it costs $6 per person. So, 6 x 6 = 36 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad together. 65 + 36 = 101 dollars.

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is 101 dollars."
"Let's break it down step by step.

First, Johnny's dad lost $5 in the first race.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won 2 x $5 + $1 = $11.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 x $11 = $16.50.

To find the total amount he lost, we need to add the amount he lost in the first and third races, and subtract the amount he won in the second race. 

Total loss = $5 (first race) + $16.50 (third race) - $11 (second race) = $10.50

To find the average loss, we need to divide the total loss by the number of races. There were 3 races.

Average loss = $10.50 / 3 = $3.50

The final answer is: $3.50"
"There are 26 countries in South America. Each country has 5 cities. So, we multiply 26 countries by 5 cities to get the total number of cities. 

26 * 5 = 130

Each city has 1000 people. So, we multiply 130 cities by 1000 people to get the total number of people in South America.

130 * 1000 = 130000

The answer is 130000."
"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we need to know their current heights. 

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is 4 x 12 = 48 inches. Then we add the 3 inches he grew, so Xavier's height now is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches. So, Cole's height now is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

Now we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height. To do this, we subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height: 52 - 51 = 1.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's say the first person took x dollars. 

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person took x + 80 dollars.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80) dollars.

The total amount they took is $1920, so we can write an equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine x terms:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

The first person took $420."
"To find out how many hours each painter worked, we need to know how many hours are in a day and how many days they worked.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

3 weeks is 3 x 7 = 21 days.

They worked 3/8 of a day each day. 3/8 of a day is 3/8 x 24 = 9 hours.

So, each painter worked 9 hours a day for 21 days.

9 hours a day x 21 days = 189 hours.

So, each painter worked 189 hours."
"Let's say the number of balls in the second set is x. 

In the first set, he retrieved x + 4 balls. 
In the third set, he retrieved x / 2 balls. 

The total number of balls is 19. So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19.

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. Multiply both sides by 2: 2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38.

Now, simplify the equation: 2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38.

Combine like terms: 5x + 8 = 38.

Subtract 8 from both sides: 5x = 30.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 6.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls in the first set: x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10.

The answer is 10."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for 3 years (2008, 2009, and 2010).

In 2008, the price of the car will be 20000 - (21% of 20000) = 20000 - 4200 = 15800.

In 2009, the price of the car will be 15800 - (21% of 15800) = 15800 - 3328 = 12472.

In 2010, the price of the car will be 12472 - (21% of 12472) = 12472 - 2620.52 = 98451.48.

The price of the car in 2010 is $9845.15"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

There are 50 books in total. Half of them are written in English. 

Half of 50 is 50 / 2 = 25. So, 25 books are written in English.

10% of the books are written in German. 10% of 50 is 50 x 0.1 = 5. So, 5 books are written in German.

Now, we know that 25 + 5 = 30 books are written in English and German. 

To find out how many books are written in Spanish, we need to subtract 30 from the total number of books. 

50 - 30 = 20. 

So, there are 20 Spanish books.

1. Romeo boards the train with 120 people.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So now, there are 120 + 20 = 140 people on the train.
3. At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train. So now, there are 140 - 50 = 90 people left on the train. Then, twice that number (2 x 50 = 100) boarded the train. So now, there are 90 + 100 = 190 people on the train.
4. At the third station, 80 more people descended from the train. So now, there are 190 - 80 = 110 people left on the train.

1. The tank top cost $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks cost $8, but she had a coupon for $2 off, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.
5. Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55.

The final answer is: $55"
"To find the total cost, we need to find out how many tiles we need. 

First, we need to find the area of one tile. Since it's a square tile, we multiply the length by the width. The length is 1ft and the width is 1ft. 

Area of one tile = length * width = 1 * 1 = 1 SqFt

Now, we need to find out how many tiles we need to cover 200 SqFt. We divide the total area by the area of one tile.

Number of tiles = Total area / Area of one tile = 200 / 1 = 200

Now, we know we need 200 tiles. Each tile costs $12. 

Total cost = Number of tiles * Cost of one tile = 200 * 12 = 2400

The answer is 2304."
"Let's break it down. 

Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king bed. He puts clean sheets on them every week. 

For the twin beds, he needs to wash 4 sets of twin sheets. Since he can wash 2 sets at a time, he needs to do 4 / 2 = 2 loads for the twin beds.

For the king bed, he needs to wash 1 set of king sheets. He can wash 1 set at a time, so he needs 1 load for the king bed.

So, in total, he needs to do 2 loads for the twin beds + 1 load for the king bed = 3 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year. To find out how many loads he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads per week by the number of weeks in a year: 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

"Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that one monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

We know that the three monkeys eat all the bananas in a week, which is 7 days. So, the total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys in a week is 315.

Let's say the third monkey eats x bananas each day. Then, the total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys in a week is:

Monkey 1: 10 bananas/day * 7 days = 70 bananas
Monkey 2: 14 bananas/day * 7 days = 98 bananas
Monkey 3: x bananas/day * 7 days = 7x bananas

The total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys in a week is 315, so we can set up the equation:

70 + 98 + 7x = 315

Combine like terms:

168 + 7x = 315

Binkie's score is 90. Twice as high as Binkie's score is 2 x 90 = 180. 

Frankie's score is 15 better than that, so we add 15 to 180. 180 + 15 = 195.

Frankie's score is 195."
"James walked to the store and back home. To find the total distance he walked, we need to multiply the distance to the store by 2. 

Distance to the store = 4 miles
Distance back home = 4 miles
Total distance = 4 + 4 = 8 miles

Since he walks 4 miles per hour, we need to divide the total distance by his speed to find the time it took him to walk.

Time = Total distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

So, it took James 2 hours to reach the store."
"Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas. Each bunch has 4 bananas. So, she buys 10 x 4 = 40 bananas.

If she buys 40 bananas individually, it will cost 40 x $0.80 = $32.00.

If she buys 10 bunches, it will cost 10 x $3.00 = $30.00.

She saved $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00."
"Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Then Harry gets x + 60 feet of fence. 

Since they have 100 feet of fence in total, we can write an equation: x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

The answer is: 20"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to know how many inches it grows in 1 year. 

We know it grows 8 inches in 4 years. 

So, to find out how many inches it grows in 1 year, we divide 8 by 4. 

8 / 4 = 2 

Now we know the crocodile grows 2 inches in 1 year. 

To find out how many inches it will grow in 13 years, we multiply 2 by 13. 

2 * 13 = 26 

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

"Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that half of the bikes sold were Trekking bikes. Since Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes, he sold 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

Next, we know that 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes. 15% of 300 is 0.15 x 300 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now, we know that the rest of the bikes sold were MTB type. So, the number of MTB bikes sold is 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

The price of one MTB is $500, the price of one BMX is $500 / 2 = $250, and the price of one Trekking bike is $450.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Marcel earned from selling each type of bike:

- MTB bikes: 105 x $500 = $52,500
- BMX bikes: 45 x $250 = $11,250
- Trekking bikes: 150 x $450 = $67,500

Now, let's add up the total amount Marcel earned from selling all the bikes:

$52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"The farmer makes 5 bales of hay each hour. If they work for 6 hours, they will make 5 x 6 = 30 bales of hay.

The truck picks up 3 bales of hay each hour. If the truck works for 6 hours, it will pick up 3 x 6 = 18 bales of hay.

To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to subtract the number of bales the truck picked up from the total number of bales made by the farmer. 

30 (total bales made by farmer) - 18 (bales picked up by truck) = 12

The answer is 12."
"First, I need to find out how many minutes John goes to class in a day. He goes to class 6 + 2 = 8 times a day. Each class is 40 minutes long. So, he goes to class for 8 x 40 = 320 minutes a day.

He goes to class 5 days a week. So, he goes to class for 320 x 5 = 1600 minutes in a week.

Now, I need to find out how many minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday. His weekly minutes are 1600. So, he spends 1/16 x 1600 = 100 minutes on Saturday and Sunday.

Now, I need to add the minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday to his weekly minutes. 100 + 1600 = 1700 minutes.

Now, I need to convert the minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 1700 / 60 = 28.33 hours."
"Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony. The third floor is 24 feet high. So, the ball goes down 24 feet and then bounces up. 

The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height. So, the height of the first bounce is 2/3 * 24 = 16 feet.

The ball goes down 16 feet and then bounces up. The height of the second bounce is 2/3 * 16 = 10.67 feet.

The answer is 10.67."
"Let's figure this out step by step.

The first child is 6 feet tall.  We need to convert feet to inches.  There are 12 inches in a foot.  So, the first child is 6 x 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child.  So, the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child.  So, the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child.  So, the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to know how many bags of apples they sold. Since they sold 2000 apples and each bag has 10 apples, we can divide 2000 by 10 to find out how many bags they sold.

2000 ÷ 10 = 200

So, the orchard sold 200 bags of apples. 

Now, we need to find out how much they earned. Since each bag costs $5, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag.

200 x 5 = 1000

The orchard earned $1000."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. Before that, the velociraptors ate half of what was left. So, the velociraptors ate half of 270 kilograms, which is 270 / 2 = 135 kilograms. 

Now, the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms and the velociraptors ate 135 kilograms. So, the total meat left after the T-Rex ate was 270 + 135 = 405 kilograms. 

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the total meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 405 * 2 = 810 kilograms.

The final answer is: 810"
"To find the total cost, we need to find the total area of the walls and then divide it by the area one gallon of paint can cover. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their area is 10 x 8 = 80 square feet each. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 + 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their area is 5 x 8 = 40 square feet each. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 + 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of the room is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since one gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need to divide the total area by 20 to find out how many gallons we need. 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

One gallon of paint costs $12, so 12 gallons will cost 12 x 12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"

"Let's break it down. 

One train is traveling 60 miles an hour. The other train is traveling half that distance per hour, so it's 60 / 2 = 30 miles an hour.

They are traveling in opposite directions, so we need to add their speeds together to find out how far apart they are getting from each other per hour. 60 + 30 = 90 miles per hour.

They are traveling for 3 hours. To find out how far apart they are, we multiply their combined speed by the time. 90 * 3 = 270 miles.

The answer is 270."
"First, I need to find out how many days Billy works. March has 31 days and April has 19 days, so 31 + 19 = 50 days. But Billy takes 20% of the days off. 20% of 50 is 10. So, he takes 10 days off. That means he works 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Now, I need to find out how many hours he works in a day. He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so that's 2 x 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, I need to find out how many people he helps in total. He works 40 days and helps 6 people per day, so that's 40 x 6 = 240 people.

"To find out how many people were inside the church, we need to find out how many people were outside the church and then subtract that number from the total number of people. 

First, let's find out how many people were in the buses. There were 12 buses and each bus carried 35 people. 

12 x 35 = 420 people in the buses.

Next, let's find out how many people were in the cars. There were 20 cars and each car carried 3 people.

20 x 3 = 60 people in the cars.

Now, we add the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars to find out how many people were outside the church.

420 + 60 = 480 people outside the church.

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the number of people outside the church from the total number of people. However, we don't know the total number of people. 

But we can assume that the total number of people is the sum of the people in the buses and the people in the cars, plus the people inside the church. 

Let's call the number of people inside the church 'x'. Then, the total number of people is 480 + x.

The total number of people is also equal to the sum of the people in the buses and the people in the cars, which is 420 + 60 = 480. 

So, we can set up the equation: 480 + x = 480 + 60.

Simplifying the equation, we get x = 60.

"To find out how long it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed of the slide.

For the biggest slide: 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide: 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to subtract the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide from the time it takes to ride the biggest slide.

5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

He does this for 5 days. 2 x 5 is 10. 

10 hours is the answer."
"Amber ran 8 miles. 
Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 3.5 x 8 = 28 miles. 
To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we need to subtract the miles Amber and Micah ran from the total miles. 
Total miles = 52 miles
Amber and Micah's miles = 8 + 28 = 36 miles
Ahito's miles = Total miles - Amber and Micah's miles = 52 - 36 = 16 miles

"Sheila started with $85.00. She returned $15.00, so she had $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00 left.

The frying pan was 20% off $20.00. 20% of $20.00 is 0.2 x $20.00 = $4.00. So the frying pan cost $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

The towels were 10% off $30.00. 10% of $30.00 is 0.1 x $30.00 = $3.00. So the towels cost $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Sheila added $16.00 for the frying pan and $27.00 for the towels to her credit card. So she added $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00 to her credit card.

The new balance on her credit card is $27.00."
"Let's break it down step by step.

A fifth of the jellyfish are large. This means if we have x jellyfish in total, then 1/5 of x are large jellyfish. 

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. This means 1/3 of the large jellyfish changed color. 

We know that 6 jellyfish changed color. This is 1/3 of the large jellyfish. So, if 1/3 of the large jellyfish is 6, then the total number of large jellyfish is 6 * 3 = 18.

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and we now know there are 18 large jellyfish, we can find the total number of jellyfish. If 1/5 of x is 18, then x is 18 * 5 = 90.

The answer is 90."

Okay, I think I get it. Lauren wants to save money for 20 years of retirement. She wants to live on 40% of her current salary, which is $100,000. So, she wants to live on $40,000 per year. 

Lauren saves 20% of her salary, which is $20,000 per year. She wants to save enough money to live on $40,000 per year for 20 years. 

To find out how much money she needs, we multiply $40,000 by 20 years. That's $800,000. 

Lauren saves $20,000 per year. To find out how many years she needs to save, we divide $800,000 by $20,000. 

$800,000 ÷ $20,000 = 40 years

Lauren needs to work for 40 years to save enough money for her retirement."

"To find out how many more miles Soledad must hike per day, we need to know how many days she has in June. June has 30 days. 

Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. If she hikes 125 miles twice a day, that's 125 x 2 = 250 miles per day. 

To find out how many days it will take her to hike 9,300 miles at 250 miles per day, we do 9,300 / 250 = 37.2 days. 

Since she only has 30 days, she will not be able to complete her journey on time. To find out how many more days she needs, we do 37.2 - 30 = 7.2 days. 

Since she can't hike a fraction of a day, we need to find out how many more miles she needs to hike in 30 days. We do 9,300 - (250 * 30) = 9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 miles. 

Now we need to find out how many miles she needs to hike per day to cover 1,800 miles in 30 days. We do 1,800 / 30 = 60 miles per day.

2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, so together they produce 2 x 6 = 12 toys an hour.
Another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour, so together they produce 2 x 4 = 8 toys an hour.
So, the total number of toys produced by 4 workers in an hour is 12 + 8 = 20 toys.

Now, all 5 workers work for 10 hours. So, the total number of toys produced by 4 workers in 10 hours is 20 x 10 = 200 toys.

The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, so the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in 10 hours is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Since 4 workers produced 200 toys in 10 hours, the 5th worker must have produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys in 10 hours.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's call this number x. 

Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted y. Then Camden painted y + 12 eggs.

Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we can write an equation: y + (y + 12) = 30

Combine like terms: 2y + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2y = 18

Divide both sides by 2: y = 9

So Sarah painted 9 eggs. Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, which is x. We also know that Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs. So we can write an equation: x + x + 21 + 9 = 56

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 56

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 26

Divide both sides by 2: x = 13

So Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs. Camden painted 21 eggs. 

The difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and the number of eggs Arnold painted is 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"Nik has 200 crayons. He wants to put them into boxes of 8 crayons each. 

First, we need to find out how many boxes he needs. We can do this by dividing the number of crayons by the number of crayons per box. 

200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes

Each box weighs 8 ounces. Since Nik has 25 boxes, we need to find the total weight of the boxes. 

25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce. Since Nik has 200 crayons, we need to find the total weight of the crayons. 

200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces

Now, we need to find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes. We can do this by adding the weight of the boxes and the weight of the crayons. 

200 ounces (boxes) + 200 ounces (crayons) = 400 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we need to divide the total weight by 16 to find the total weight in pounds. 

400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds

The final answer is: 25"
"First, John cuts down an 80-foot tree. He can make logs out of 80% of it. 80% of 80 is 0.8 x 80 = 64. 

He cuts it into 4-foot logs. So, he can make 64 / 4 = 16 logs.

From each of those logs, he cuts 5 planks. So, he can make 16 x 5 = 80 planks.

He sells each plank for $1.2. So, he makes 80 x $1.2 = $96.

The final answer is: $96"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Valerie earns $5000 per month. Her brother earns 1/2 of what she earns, so her brother earns 1/2 x $5000 = $2500 per month.

Their combined salary is $5000 + $2500 = $7500 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so their mother earns 2 x $7500 = $15000 per month.

To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their salaries: $5000 + $2500 + $15000 = $19500.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. 

She walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk than on the beach. 

Let's say her speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Then her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she spends 40 minutes on the beach. So, the distance she covers on the beach is 2 miles. 

Distance = Speed x Time. 

2 = x x 40 

x = 2/40 
x = 1/20 miles per minute 

Now, we know her speed on the beach is 1/20 miles per minute. 

Her speed on the sidewalk is 2x = 2 x 1/20 = 1/10 miles per minute.

Now, let's find the time she takes to cover 1 mile on the sidewalk. 

Time = Distance / Speed 

Time = 1 / (1/10) 
Time = 10 minutes 

So, she takes 10 minutes to cover 1 mile on the sidewalk. 

Now, let's find the total time she takes to cover 3 miles. 

Time = Distance / Speed 

Time = 3 / (1/10) 
Time = 3 x 10 
Time = 30 minutes 

She takes 30 minutes to cover 1 mile on the beach and 10 minutes to cover 1 mile on the sidewalk. 

So, the total time she takes to cover 3 miles is 30 + 10 + 10 = 50 minutes.

The final answer is: 50"
"Jane saved $4 every week for 8 weeks. She saved 4 x 8 = 32 dollars. 

To find out how much more she needs to save, we need to subtract 32 from 60. 60 - 32 = 28. 

Since she saves $4 every week, we need to divide 28 by 4 to find out how many more weeks it will take. 28 / 4 = 7. 

The answer is 7."

2 trees had 4 blue birds each, so that's 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds. 

1 tree had 3 blue birds. 

Now, let's add all the blue birds together: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds. 

The answer is 32."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Bob has a certain number of marbles. If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. 

First, we need to find out how many marbles 2 dozen is. 1 dozen is 12, so 2 dozen is 2 x 12 = 24 marbles.

So, if Bob receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has now, we need to subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36 marbles.

Now, if he loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from 36.

36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

So, Bob will have 26 marbles.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Donny has two mugs of water. One is 33 degrees and the other is unknown. He pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle. 

Since he can now drink the water, the temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. 

The amount of water poured from the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces, and the amount of water poured from the other mug is 1 ounce. 

Let's say the temperature of the other mug is x degrees. 

The total amount of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug + 1 ounce from the other mug). 

The total temperature of the water in the bottle is 33 degrees * 4/5 + x * 1/5 (since 4/5 of the water is from the 33-degree mug and 1/5 of the water is from the other mug).

The total temperature of the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees. 

So, we can write the equation: 33 * 4/5 + x * 1/5 >= 40.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 5: 33 * 4 + x >= 40 * 5.

This simplifies to 132 + x >= 200.

Now, we subtract 132 from both sides: x >= 68.

So, the temperature of the other mug must be at least 68 degrees.

The final answer is: 68"
"Melanie's father starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens. 

In one week, there are 7 days. So, in three weeks, there are 3 x 7 = 21 days.

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, so in 21 days, they bring 20 x 21 = 420 cows.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day, so in 21 days, they bring 10 x 21 = 210 chickens.

Now, we add the cows and chickens Melanie's father started with to the cows and chickens brought by the companies. 

50 (initial cows) + 420 (cows from Milkie Cows Limited) = 470 cows
20 (initial chickens) + 210 (chickens from Broilers Limited) = 230 chickens

Now, we add the total number of cows and chickens together. 
470 (cows) + 230 (chickens) = 700

"First, I need to find out how much 4 packs of bagels cost. Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs will cost 4 x $10.00 = $40.00.

Then, I need to find out how much the discount is. The discount is 10% of $40.00. To find 10% of $40.00, I need to multiply $40.00 by 0.1. 0.1 x $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, I need to subtract the discount from the total cost of 4 packs. $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now, I need to find out how many bagels there are in 4 packs. Each pack has 9 bagels, so 4 packs will have 4 x 9 = 36 bagels.

Now, I need to find out how much each bagel will cost. To do this, I need to divide the total cost of 4 packs by the number of bagels. $36.00 ÷ 36 = $1.00.

"To find out how many women are on the bus, we need to first find out how many parts of the ratio are women. The ratio is 5:9, so there are 9 parts that are women. 

To find out how many people each part represents, we need to divide the total number of passengers by the total number of parts in the ratio. The total number of parts is 5 + 9 = 14. 

So, 84 ÷ 14 = 6. This means each part represents 6 people.

Since there are 9 parts that are women, we multiply 9 by 6 to find out how many women are on the bus. 9 x 6 = 54.

Now, 20 women alight from the bus. To find out how many women are left, we subtract 20 from 54. 54 - 20 = 34.

Faraday earns $26 from the sunflowers per day. He sells sunflowers for $2 each. To find out how many sunflowers he sells per day, we need to divide the money he earns from sunflowers by the price of one sunflower.

$26 (from sunflowers) ÷ $2 (price of one sunflower) = 13 sunflowers per day

Faraday earns $56 from the bouquets per day. Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers. To find out how many bouquets he sells per day, we need to divide the money he earns from bouquets by the price of one bouquet.

$56 (from bouquets) ÷ $8 (price of one bouquet) = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we need to multiply the number of bouquets by the number of sunflowers in each bouquet to find out how many sunflowers are in the bouquets he sells per day.

7 bouquets per day × 12 sunflowers per bouquet = 84 sunflowers per day

Now, we need to find out how many sunflowers he sells in total in 3 days. We can multiply the number of sunflowers he sells per day by the number of days.

13 sunflowers per day + 84 sunflowers per day = 97 sunflowers per day (from sunflowers and bouquets)

97 sunflowers per day × 3 days = 291 sunflowers

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to know how many bottles are needed for 100% of one person's daily energy demand.

Since each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, we need to find out how many bottles are needed for 100% of one person's daily energy demand. 

100% is 5 times 20% (because 100/20 = 5). So, 5 bottles are needed for 100% of one person's daily energy demand.

Now, we need to find out how many bottles are needed for 2300 people. We multiply 2300 by 5 (the number of bottles needed for one person).

"Let's break it down step by step.

A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so it produces 3 x 50 = 150 fruits.
A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so it produces 7 x 50 = 350 fruits.
An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We don't know how many a 10-year-old tree produces yet, but we can call it x. So, an 8-year-old tree produces x - 200 fruits.
A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits.
A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so it produces 20 x 50 = 1000 fruits.

We know that an 8-year-old tree produces x - 200 fruits, and a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits. Since an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, we can say that x - 200 = 1000. To find x, we add 200 to both sides of the equation: x = 1000 + 200 = 1200.

Now we know that an 8-year-old tree produces 1200 - 200 = 1000 fruits.

Now we can add up all the fruits produced by the tree in 10 years: 50 + 150 + 350 + 1000 + 0 + 1000 = 1550.

Let's say the length of the yellow rope is Y. 
The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the blue rope is Y - 7. 
The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is 4 * (Y - 7). 

The total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write an equation: 
Y + (Y - 7) + 4 * (Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms: 
Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37
Combine Y terms: 
6Y - 35 = 37

Blue rope = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope: 
Red rope = 4 * (Y - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."
"Let's break it down step by step.

Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so if Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 x $5 = $15.

After they both gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount they gave x. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

We know that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

$15 - x = (4/5) x $15

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

5($15 - x) = 4 x $15
$75 - 5x = $60

Now, let's isolate x by subtracting $75 from both sides:

-5x = -$15

Divide both sides by -5:

x = $3

So, Ronnie gave $3 to their little sister. Now, let's find out how much money Ronnie has left:

$5 - $3 = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

There are 4 colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow. 

We know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint. So, let's say the amount of red, white, and purple paint is x. 

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow. So, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints. 

The total amount of red, white, and purple paint is 12 - 6 = 6 pints. 

Since there are 3 colors with equal amounts, we can divide 6 by 3 to find the amount of each color. 6 / 3 = 2. 

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to find the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom: 
Area of one bedroom = length x width = 20 x 12 = 240 square feet

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms = 4 x 240 = 960 square feet

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area = 5 x 240 = 1200 square feet

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add them together: 
Total area of the house = area of bedrooms + area of living room + area of the rest of the house
= 960 + 1200 + 1000
= 3160 square feet

The final answer is: 3160"

"To find out how many pods are in the new box, we need to find 20% of 100 and add it to 100. 

20% of 100 is 0.2 x 100 = 20. 

So, the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we need to find out how many times we can use 1 pod for $1. We know that the new box costs $12 for 120 pods. 

To find out how much 1 pod costs, we divide $12 by 120. 

$12 ÷ 120 = $0.1 per pod.

Now, we know that 1 pod costs $0.1. So, for $1, we can use 1 / 0.1 = 10 pods.

"Thomas starts with 1000/20 = 50 bills. 

He loses 10 bills, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, so he uses 40/2 = 20 bills. He has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

He triples his money, so he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now 5 dollars, he has 60 * 5 = 300 dollars in 5 dollar bills.

The final answer is: 300"
"Let's break it down step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 x 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 x 8 = 2 goals.

So, in the first half, team A scores 4 goals and team B scores 2 goals. In the second half, team A scores 2 goals and team B scores 8 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 + 2 = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16."
"The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. He uses 45% of it on Monday. 45% of 5 is 2.25. So, he has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches left.

He will recycle the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. To find out how many days he has left, we need to find out how many days it will take for 2.75 inches to go down to 2 inches.

Let's say he uses 20% of the chalk each day. 20% of 2.75 is 0.55. So, each day he uses 0.55 inches of chalk.

To find out how many days it will take for 2.75 to go down to 2, we can divide 2.75 - 2 = 0.75 by 0.55. 

0.75 / 0.55 = 1.3636

So, the teacher has 1.36 days left before he has to recycle the chalk."
"To find out how many students are not on varsity, we need to know how many students are on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity. There are 12 girls. One-third of 12 is 4. So, 4 girls are on varsity.

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity. There are 12 boys. One-fourth of 12 is 3. So, 3 boys are on varsity.

In total, 4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students are on varsity.

There are 12 boys and 12 girls in the class. So, 12 + 12 = 24 students in total.

To find out how many students are not on varsity, we need to subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students. 24 - 7 = 17.

"To find out how much Mr. Marcellus got in refunds, we need to find out how many gallons of milk were bad and then multiply that by the cost per gallon.

First, we need to find out how many gallons of milk were bad. 2/5 of 4000 gallons is bad. 

To find 2/5 of 4000, we multiply 4000 by 2 and then divide by 5.

4000 x 2 = 8000
8000 / 5 = 1600

So, 1600 gallons of milk were bad. 

Now, we multiply the number of bad gallons by the cost per gallon to find the refund amount.

1600 x $3.5 = $5600

Mr. Marcellus got $5600 in refunds."
"Let's break it down step by step.

Let Colin's current age be x.

In 7 years, Colin will be x + 7 years old.

Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in 7 years, so Wendy's current age is 5(x + 7).

In 25 years, Colin will be x + 25 years old.

In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now, so x + 25 = (1/3) * 5(x + 7).

Now, let's simplify the equation:

x + 25 = (1/3) * 5(x + 7)
x + 25 = (5/3)(x + 7)
3(x + 25) = 5(x + 7)
3x + 75 = 5x + 35
75 - 35 = 5x - 3x

Bob has $27000 to spend on books. He can buy 100 books for $500. 

To find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy, we need to divide $27000 by $500. 

$27000 ÷ $500 = 54

This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books. 

Now, we need to find out how many books he can buy in total. 

54 sets of 100 books = 54 x 100 = 5400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books to 3 schools, we need to divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books each school will get. 

5400 ÷ 3 = 1800

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school."

First, we need to find out how many bags of coal Ali ordered. We know he ordered 850 kilos of coal and each bag is 50 kg. 

To find the number of bags, we divide the total weight of coal by the weight of each bag: 

850 kg / 50 kg = 17 bags

Now, we know Ali ordered 17 bags of coal. Each bag costs $18. 

To find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag: 

17 bags * $18 per bag = $306

First, we need to find out how many slices of cheese pizza and pepperoni pizza Kate's friends ate in total. 

6 friends ate 6 slices of cheese pizza each, so 6 x 6 = 36 slices of cheese pizza. 
6 friends ate 4 slices of pepperoni pizza each, so 6 x 4 = 24 slices of pepperoni pizza.

Now, we need to find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy for each type. 
There are 12 slices in a cheese pizza, so to find out how many pies, we need to divide 36 slices by 12. 
36 ÷ 12 = 3. 

There are 8 slices in a pepperoni pizza, so to find out how many pies, we need to divide 24 slices by 8.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in 1 hour. To find out how many he can build in 15 minutes, we need to divide 20 by 4 (since there are 4 15-minute periods in an hour). 

20 / 4 = 5 snowballs in 15 minutes.

Now, Jay builds 5 snowballs but 2 melt every 15 minutes. So, he is left with 5 - 2 = 3 snowballs after 15 minutes.

To find out how many snowballs he has after 1 hour, we multiply 3 by 4 (since there are 4 15-minute periods in an hour).

3 * 4 = 12 snowballs after 1 hour.

Since Jay wants 60 snowballs, we need to find out how many 12s are in 60.

"Let's figure this out. 

If John is 28 now and he was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we need to find out how old Jim was 20 years ago. 

To do that, we need to find out how old John was 20 years ago. We can do that by subtracting 20 from John's current age. 

John's current age is 28. 
28 - 20 = 8 

So, John was 8 years old 20 years ago. 

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we need to divide John's age 20 years ago by 2 to find Jim's age 20 years ago. 

8 / 2 = 4 

So, Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago. 

To find Jim's current age, we need to add 20 to Jim's age 20 years ago. 

4 + 20 = 24 

So, Jim is 24 years old now."

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. 

So, they had 38 + 50 = 88 bandages at the end of the first day.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. 

So, they had 88 - 28 = 60 bandages at the end of the second day.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which is 2 x 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. 

So, they had 60 + 100 - 25 = 135 bandages at the end of the third day.

But they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means they used 135 - 78 = 57 bandages on the third day.

Now, let's go back to the first day. They used 38 bandages and had some left. Let's call the number of bandages they started with 'x'. 

So, x - 38 = 88 - 57 (because they used 57 bandages on the third day, but we need to find out how many they had left after the first day, which is 88 - 57 = 31 bandages).

So, four times the number of coffee mugs is 4x.

Eight more than that is 4x + 8.

The question says this is equal to 40. So we can write an equation:

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the 8 on the left side. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Now we need to get rid of the 4 that is multiplied by x. We can do this by dividing both sides by 4:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Mattison's house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the house is 7 x 60 = 420 inches.

The first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so the height of the first floor is 3 x 60 = 180 inches.

Since the total height of the house is 420 inches, and the first floor is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The roof is above the second floor, so we need to find the height from the second floor's floor to the roof. We don't have any information about the height of the second floor, but we know the total height of the house is 420 inches and the first floor is 180 inches.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. 

The medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters of water per day.

The high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, so it removes 2 x 2 = 4 liters of water per day.

Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, so it removed 3 x 1 = 3 liters of water.

He then ran it for 3 days on the medium setting, so it removed 3 x 2 = 6 liters of water.

Finally, he ran it for 5 days on the high setting, so it removed 5 x 4 = 20 liters of water.

To find the total amount of water removed, we add the water removed on each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The final answer is: 29"
"They filled up 10 packs of balloons. Each pack has 30 balloons. So, they have 10 x 30 = 300 balloons. 

They had 300 balloons and 12 are left. So, they threw 300 - 12 = 288 balloons."
"To find out how much of the second medicine Saanvi needs, we need to multiply 14 mL by 3. 

14 mL * 3 = 42 mL

So, for one dose, Saanvi needs 14 mL of the first medicine and 42 mL of the second medicine.

To find out how much of each medicine Saanvi needs for 8 doses, we need to multiply the amount of each medicine by 8.

For the first medicine: 14 mL * 8 = 112 mL
For the second medicine: 42 mL * 8 = 336 mL

To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we need to add the amount of the first medicine and the second medicine.

112 mL + 336 mL = 448 mL

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Ali's class has 120 students. 

John's class has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class. To find 1/8 of 120, we need to divide 120 by 8. 

120 / 8 = 15 

So, each of John's classes has 15 students. 

John has two classes, so we need to multiply 15 by 2 to find the total capacity of John's school. 

15 * 2 = 30 

Now, we need to find the combined capacity of both schools. We add the capacity of Ali's school (which is 120) to the capacity of John's school (which is 30). 

120 + 30 = 150 

The final answer is: 150"
"Stephen borrowed $300. He has to pay 2% of $300 as interest. 2% of $300 is 0.02 x 300 = $6. 

So, Stephen has to pay $300 + $6 = $306 in total. 

He pays $25 per month for 11 months, so he pays 11 x $25 = $275 in 11 months. 

In the twelfth month, Stephen has to pay the remaining amount, which is $306 - $275 = $31.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers. So, she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day. 

Jordan changes the other half, which is also 5 diapers per day. 

The answer is 5."
"To find the total number of jelly beans, we need to find the volume of the jar and divide it by the volume of one jelly bean, then multiply by the efficiency and the percentage of red jelly beans.

The volume of the jar is 6 x 6 x 15 = 540 cubic inches.

The volume of one jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches.

The total number of jelly beans is 540 / 0.15 = 3600.

The efficiency is 80%, so the number of jelly beans that can actually fit in the jar is 3600 x 0.8 = 2880.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans is 2880 x 0.3 = 864.

The true number of red jelly beans is 900, so Tim's guess was off by 864 - 900 = -36."
"Let's break it down step by step.

1. The bus started with 20 people.
2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus now is 20 + 40 = 60.
3. At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop entered the bus. 3/4 of 40 is 30. So, 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. Now, the total number of people on the bus is 60 + 30 = 90.
4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus now is 90 * 2 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

"Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year. 

First, let's find out how much she spent in the first 5 years. 
The cost of one visit is $2. 
So, she visits 3 times a year, so 3 x 2 = 6 dollars per year. 
In 5 years, she spent 6 x 5 = 30 dollars.

Now, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. 
150% of 2 is 3. 
So, the new cost of one visit is 2 + 3 = 5 dollars. 
She still visits 3 times a year, so 3 x 5 = 15 dollars per year. 
In 3 more years, she spent 15 x 3 = 45 dollars.

Now, we add the money she spent in the first 5 years and the money she spent in the next 3 years. 
30 + 45 = 75 dollars.

"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to know how many students are trying the escape room and how many can try at a time.

There are 10 students in each grade and there are 4 grades (4-7). So, there are 10 x 4 = 40 students in total.

Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. 

To find out how many groups we need, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group: 40 / 8 = 5.

Since each group uses 45 minutes, we multiply the number of groups by the time per group: 5 x 45 = 225.

The answer is 225."
"John made 4 tables for $20 each. So, 4 x 20 = 80 dollars for the tables. 

John also made 2 roof frames for $10 each. So, 2 x 10 = 20 dollars for the roof frames.

The answer is 100."
"Let's say the shorter piece is x. The longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the longer piece is 4x.

The total length of the board is 40 feet, and it's made up of the shorter and longer pieces. So, we can write an equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

So the shorter piece is 8 feet long. The longer piece is 4x, which is 4 * 8 = 32 feet.

The longer piece is 32 feet."
"Aiden needs to make 80 meatballs. He gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. To find out how many pounds of meat he needs, we divide 80 by 16.

80 ÷ 16 = 5

So, Aiden needs 5 pounds of meat. He uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for each pound of meat. To find out how much seasoning he needs, we multiply 5 by 2.

5 x 2 = 10

Aiden needs 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning."

Number of windows: 5
Width of each window: 35 inches

Total width of windows = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width of windows = 5 * 35
Total width of windows = 175 inches

Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. 

Fabric needed = 2 * Total width of windows
Fabric needed = 2 * 175
Fabric needed = 350 inches

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's say the number of cupcakes she makes is x. Then, the number of brownies she makes is 3x - 2.

We also know that each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. So, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies. So, we can write the equation: x + (3x - 2) = 10.

Now, let's solve the equation. First, we combine like terms: x + 3x - 2 = 10. This becomes 4x - 2 = 10.

Next, we add 2 to both sides of the equation: 4x = 10 + 2. This becomes 4x = 12.

Now, we divide both sides by 4: x = 12 / 4. This becomes x = 3.

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"First, we need to find the total cost of the manicure and pedicure. The manicure is $35 and the pedicure is $40.

0.2 x 75 = 15

Now, we need to subtract 15 from 75 to get the discount. 

75 - 15 = 60

Now, we need to find out how much nail art will cost. There are 10 fingers on each hand, and she wants to add nail art on each finger. 

10 x 2 = 20

The nail art costs $3 per nail, so we need to multiply 20 by 3.

20 x 3 = 60

Now, we need to add the cost of the manicure and pedicure, and the cost of the nail art. 

60 + 60 = 120

Susan has 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year. So, she gets 3 x 12 = 36 issues from these magazines.

She has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year. So, she gets 1 x 6 = 6 issues from this magazine.

Her last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which means it sends 4 x 6 = 24 issues a year.

Now, let's add up all the issues she gets from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan gets 66 magazines every year."

"To find the price of the toy after it was discounted in January, we need to follow the steps:

1. The price of the toy in November is $40.
2. In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.8 (100% + 80% = 180%, or 1 + 1.8 = 2.8, or 100% + 80% = 180%, or 1 + 80/100 = 1.8).
   So, the price in December is $40 x 1.8 = $72.
3. In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we multiply the price in December by 0.5 (100% - 50% = 50%, or 1 - 0.5 = 0.5, or 100% - 50% = 50%, or 1 - 50/100 = 0.5).
   So, the price in January is $72 x 0.5 = $36.

"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make, we need to calculate the money he makes from the standard lessons and the money he makes from the lessons with the veteran.

First, let's find out how much money he makes from the standard lessons. He has 4 standard lessons at $80 each. 

4 x 80 = 320

Now, let's find out how much money he makes from the lessons with the veteran. He has 2 lessons with a veteran, and he reduces his rate by 25%. To find the reduced rate, we need to subtract 25% of $80 from $80.

25% of 80 is 0.25 x 80 = 20

So, the reduced rate is 80 - 20 = 60

Now, let's find out how much money he makes from the lessons with the veteran. He has 2 lessons at $60 each.

2 x 60 = 120

Now, let's add the money he makes from the standard lessons and the money he makes from the lessons with the veteran.

Regina wrote 9 novels last year. This is 3 quarters of the number of novels she wrote this year. 

To find the total number of novels she wrote this year, we need to find out what number 9 is 3 quarters of. 

Let's call the total number of novels she wrote this year ""x"". 

Since 9 is 3 quarters of x, we can write an equation: 

9 = (3/4) * x 

To find x, we need to multiply both sides by 4/3. 

x = 9 * (4/3) 

x = 12 

So Regina wrote 12 novels this year.

Now, I need to multiply the speed by the time to find the distance he traveled. 

Speed = 50 km/hr
Time = 72 hours
Distance = Speed * Time = 50 km/hr * 72 hours = 3600 km

Now, I need to find the percentage of the distance he covered. 

Distance covered = 3600 km

"Let's break it down step by step.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. 
Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 6 x 5 = 30 grapes.

Now, we have 6 (Madeline's grapes) + 30 (brother's grapes) = 36 grapes used so far. 

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie needs 12 grapes, so she used 4 x 12 = 48 grapes.

Now, we have 36 (used grapes) + 48 (mother's grapes) = 84 grapes used in total.

To find out how many grapes were there at the beginning, we need to add the grapes that were used to the grapes that were left. But we don't know how many grapes were left. Let's call the total number of grapes at the beginning 'x'. 

We know that x - 84 = the number of grapes left. 

Since the mother used all the remaining grapes, the number of grapes left is 48. So, x - 84 = 48.

Now, we can solve for x: x = 48 + 84 = 132.

The final answer is: 132"

The gruyere cheese costs twice the amount of cheddar cheese, so it costs $3.00 x 2 = $6.00.

So, the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one week is $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00.

Now, we multiply the weekly cost by 52 (the number of weeks in a year): $10.00 x 52 = $520.00.

"To find out how many classrooms the custodian can clean in a day, we need to multiply the number of hours they work in a day by the number of classrooms they can clean in an hour.

First, we need to find out how many classrooms they can clean in an hour. We know it takes them 15 minutes per classroom, so we need to convert 15 minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 15 minutes is 15/60 = 0.25 hours.

Now, we can divide 1 hour by 0.25 hours to find out how many classrooms they can clean in an hour. 1 / 0.25 = 4 classrooms per hour.

Now, we can multiply the number of classrooms they can clean in an hour by the number of hours they work in a day. 4 classrooms per hour * 8 hours per day = 32 classrooms per day.

Now, we can divide the total number of classrooms by the number of classrooms they can clean in a day to find out how many days it will take them to clean all the classrooms. 80 classrooms / 32 classrooms per day = 2.5 days.

Since they have 5 days to get it done, we can find out how many hours they will work in total. 5 days * 8 hours per day = 40 hours.

Now, we can divide the total number of hours they will work by the number of hours they work in a day to find out how many days they will work in total. 40 hours / 8 hours per day = 5 days.

Now, we can find out how many hours they will spend cleaning classrooms in a day. 8 hours per day - (15 minutes per classroom * 4 classrooms per hour) = 8 hours per day - 1 hour per day = 7 hours per day.

Now, we can find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning classrooms. (1 hour / 8 hours) * 100 = 12.5%

"Let's break it down step by step.

The middle shelves can hold 10 books each. There are 2 middle shelves, so they can hold 2 x 10 = 20 books.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 x 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up how many books all the shelves can hold: 20 (middle) + 20 (bottom) + 15 (top) = 55 books.

Since each bookcase has 3 shelves, and each shelf can hold 55 books, we need to divide 110 by 55 to find out how many bookcases we need. 

110 / 55 = 2.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all her books."

She will sell 3 eggs for $1. So, she will sell 60 eggs for 60 / 3 x $1 = $20.

Her profit is the money she will get from selling the eggs minus the money she paid for the eggs. So, her profit is $20 - $12 = $8.

Combine like terms: 6x - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6x = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 20.

"Let's count the flashlights first. There are 4 people and each person has a flashlight, so there are 4 flashlights. There are 8 rooms and each room has 2 flashlights, so there are 8 x 2 = 16 flashlights. In total, there are 4 + 16 = 20 flashlights.

Now, let's count the candles. Half the rooms have 4 small candles each, so there are 4 rooms with 4 small candles each. That's 4 x 4 = 16 small candles. The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so there are 4 rooms with 5 medium candles each. That's 4 x 5 = 20 medium candles. In total, there are 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

To find the total number of items, we add them together: 10 + 20 + 10 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many calls Tim deals with in a day, we need to divide the number of hours he works by the number of minutes it takes to deal with a call, and then multiply by 60 to get the total minutes he works in a day.

6 hours * 60 minutes = 360 minutes

Now, we divide the total minutes he works in a day by the minutes it takes to deal with a call.

360 minutes / 15 minutes = 24 calls

Since Tim works 5 days a week, we multiply the number of calls he deals with in a day by 5.

24 calls * 5 days = 120 calls

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how long it will take for the coat of varnish to dry on 6 paintings with the new varnish, we need to multiply the time it takes for one painting by 6.

For the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes for one painting, so for 6 paintings it will take 7 x 6 = 42 minutes.

For the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes for one painting, so for 6 paintings it will take 12 x 6 = 72 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how much longer it will take for the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish. We do this by subtracting the time it takes for the old varnish to dry from the time it takes for the new varnish to dry.

72 (new varnish) - 42 (old varnish) = 30

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish.

"Let's break it down. 

Crista has 20 plants. 4 plants need half a cup of water, so that's 4 x 0.5 = 2 cups. 

8 plants need 1 cup of water, so that's 8 x 1 = 8 cups. 

The rest of the plants need a quarter of a cup of water. There are 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants left. So, 8 x 0.25 = 2 cups. 

Now, let's add all the cups together: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

"Phineas needs to hop and swim half of 200 yards. Half of 200 yards is 100 yards. 

For the land part, he hops 20 yards per minute. To find out how long it takes, we divide 100 yards by 20 yards per minute. 100 / 20 = 5 minutes. 

For the water part, he swims 10 yards per minute. To find out how long it takes, we divide 100 yards by 10 yards per minute. 100 / 10 = 10 minutes.

Phineas needs to hop for 5 minutes and swim for 10 minutes. So, the total time is 5 + 10 = 15 minutes.

"To find out how much it will cost Bob, we need to know how many boxes of popsicle sticks he needs to buy. 

We know Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks and there are 8 sticks in a box. 

To find out how many boxes he needs, we divide 56 by 8. 

56 ÷ 8 = 7

So Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicle sticks. 

Each box costs $2.00. 

To find out the total cost, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box. 

7 x $2.00 = $14.00

The final answer is: $14.00"
"Let's break it down. The main phone costs $20. The other phones are called ""additional phones"". 

The question says the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. This means if one additional phone costs x, the main phone costs 2x. 

Since the main phone costs $20, we can say 2x = 20. To find x, we divide both sides by 2. 

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

So each additional phone costs $10. There are 4 additional phones. 

The cost of the additional phones is 4 x 10 = 40. 

The cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones. 

The cost of the whole phone plan is 20 + 40 = 60.

June has 30 days. So, Derrick makes $240 x 30 = $7200 in June."
"Jade has 210 photos. She uploads 6 batches a day. Each batch has 7 photos. 

To find out how many batches she needs, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos in each batch. 

210 / 7 = 30. 

But we need to find out how many days it will take to upload all the photos. We know she uploads 6 batches a day. 

So, we divide the total number of batches by the number of batches she uploads each day.

"I don't know what WPM means. Is it like how many words I can say in a minute? 

Okay, let me think... John's normal speed is 150 words per minute. If he gets 2.5 times faster, that means he can say 150 x 2.5 = 375 words per minute.

Now, we need to find out how many words are in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so 10 pages have 10 x 450 = 4500 words.

Now, we need to find out how long it will take John to say 4500 words. We know he can say 375 words in 1 minute. So, to say 4500 words, it will take him 4500 / 375 = 12 minutes.

"Let's break it down step by step.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.

In the next 30 seconds, 3 times the amount of the first 30 seconds pop, so 3 x 20 = 60 kernels pop.

In the next 30 seconds, 4 times the amount of the second 30 seconds pop, so 4 x 60 = 240 kernels pop.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds, so 240 / 2 = 120 kernels pop.

So, in total, 20 + 60 + 240 + 120 = 340 kernels pop.

But, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat, so 120 / 4 = 30 kernels pop.

So, in total, Garrett has 340 + 30 = 370 pieces of popcorn."
"Tim needs to make 5 gallons of lemonade. 4 gallons are regular and 1 gallon is extra and twice as tart. 

For the 4 regular gallons, he needs 4 cups of lemon juice. Since 6 lemons give 1 cup of juice, he needs 4 x 6 = 24 lemons for the regular gallons.

For the extra gallon, he needs 2 cups of lemon juice because it's twice as tart. So, he needs 2 x 6 = 12 lemons for the extra gallon.

In total, Tim needs 24 + 12 = 36 lemons."

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

First year depreciation: 30% of $9000 is 0.3 x 9000 = $2700. 
So, the value of the boat after the first year is 9000 - 2700 = $6300.

Second year depreciation: 30% of $6300 is 0.3 x 6300 = $1890. 
So, the value of the boat after the second year is 6300 - 1890 = $4410.

Third year depreciation: 20% of $4410 is 0.2 x 4410 = $882. 
So, the value of the boat after the third year is 4410 - 882 = $3528.

So, the total weight is 1200 + 250 + 75 + 75 = 1600 pounds.

Since the force to move the car is 1% of the weight, we need to find 1% of 1600.

1% is the same as 1/100, so we multiply 1600 by 1/100.

1600 * 1/100 = 16

So, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."

So, the total amount she spent is $3.50 + $15 + $8.50 = $27. 

Janet's parents gave her $40. 
To find out how much she has left, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the amount her parents gave her. 
So, $40 - $27 = $13. 

The final answer is: $13"
"Josh services 3 cars a day. He is open 6 days a week (Monday to Saturday). 

6 days a week * 2 weeks = 12 days

12 days * 3 cars a day = 36 cars

He gets paid $4 per car. 

36 cars * $4 per car = $144

The final answer is: $144"
"Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. 

He ate 1 oatmeal cookie, 1 chocolate chip cookie, and 1 sugar cookie for his snack. So, he has 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies, 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies left.

Then, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So, he has 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies left.

He gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So, he has 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies left.

Then, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. So, he now has 6 oatmeal cookies, 3 chocolate chip cookies, 2 sugar cookies, 4 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 4 sugar cookies.

To find the total number of cookies, we add them together: 6 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"Matthew has 12 toy soldiers. He wants to sell half of them for $5 and the other half for $7. 

Half of 12 is 6. So, he will sell 6 toy soldiers for $5 each and 6 toy soldiers for $7 each.

6 toy soldiers for $5 each will be 6 x 5 = 30 dollars.
6 toy soldiers for $7 each will be 6 x 7 = 42 dollars.

Now, we add 30 and 42 together. 30 + 42 = 72.

So, Matthew will earn 72 dollars."
"Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days. So, the dog digs 6 x 14 = 84 holes.

Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, Nate fills 9 - 6 = 3 holes a day.

To find out how many days it takes to fill the holes, we need to divide the total number of holes by the number of holes filled per day. 84 / 3 = 28 days.

There are 7 days in a week. To find out how many weeks it takes, we need to divide the number of days by 7. 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

The final answer is: 4"
"Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. To find out how many students Butler High School enrolls, we need to multiply 4000 by 3/4.

4000 * 3/4 = 3000

So, Butler High School enrolls 3000 students. 

To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is than Butler High School, we need to subtract the number of students at Butler High School from the number of students at Norman High School.

4000 - 3000 = 1000

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies they made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

First, we add the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies together.
2595 + 3075 = 5670

Now, we subtract the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.
7995 - 5670 = 2325

So, the Adams family made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"Let's break it down step by step.

Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

He gathered two more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

He gathered the correct number of beakers, which is 7.

In total, he gathered 8 test tubes + 16 Petri dishes + 7 beakers = 31 items.

But he only placed 29 items on the lab bench. This means he lost 31 - 29 = 2 beakers.

The answer is 2."
"James is putting together 4 tables. Each table has 4 legs and each leg needs 2 screws. So, each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws. 

4 tables need 4 x 8 = 32 screws. 

James has 40 screws. He will use 32 screws. So, he will have 40 - 32 = 8 screws left over.

"If there are 10 eggs in a basket, and there are twice as many eggs in a second basket, that means the second basket has 2 x 10 = 20 eggs.

So, we have 10 eggs in the first basket and 20 eggs in the second basket. 

To find the total number of eggs, we add the eggs in both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30.

The answer is 30."
"Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra. Alexandra raises $430. So Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah. Sarah raises $300. So Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now we add up all the money they raised. $750 + $430 + $700 + $300 = $2180.

The final answer is $2180."
"Let's break it down step by step.

Vanessa ran 4 miles. 
Aaron ran half the distance of Vanessa, so Aaron ran 4 / 2 = 2 miles.

Since Aaron was able to run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, it means Aaron ran 2 miles in half the time it took Vanessa to run 4 miles. 

If Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, then Vanessa took twice as long to run her part. 

So, Vanessa took 16 * 2 = 32 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final answer is: 32"
"The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. If there is 200 feet of dock, he needs 3 x 200 = 600 feet of line. He already has 6 feet of line. So, he needs 600 - 6 = 594 feet of line.

"Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night. They order 2 meals that cost $5 each, so that's 2 x $5 = $10. They also order a $5 bottle of wine. So, they spend $10 + $5 = $15 per reservation. 

They get 6 reservations a night and they are open 2 days a week. So, they get 6 x 2 = 12 reservations a week. 

They make $15 per reservation, so they make 12 x $15 = $180 per week."
"Let's break it down step by step.

The fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. 

To find out how much he spent on each watermelon, we need to divide the total cost by the number of watermelons. 

$80 ÷ 50 = $1.60

So, the fruit vendor spent $1.60 on each watermelon.

He sold all the watermelons at a profit of 25%. This means he sold each watermelon for 125% of the cost (100% of the cost + 25% profit).

To find out how much he sold each watermelon for, we need to multiply the cost by 1.25 (which is 125% or 100% + 25%).

$1.60 x 1.25 = $2

So, the fruit vendor sold each watermelon for $2."
"Let's break it down step by step.

James is now twice as old as Dora, and Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. So, Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James is 2 x 9 = 18 years old now.

James is 18 now, and he is John's son who was born when John was 19. So, John is 18 + 19 = 37 years old now.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32. So, John's youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old now.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's think about this. 

Ana peels 1 orange in 3 minutes. 
Jane peels 1 orange in 4 minutes. 

To find out how many oranges they can peel in 1 hour (60 minutes), we need to divide 60 by 3 for Ana and 60 by 4 for Jane.

Ana can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges in 1 hour. 
Jane can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges in 1 hour.

Now, we need to find out how many more oranges Ana has peeled than Jane. 
To do this, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peeled from the number of oranges Ana peeled. 

20 (Ana) - 15 (Jane) = 5

So, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

The final answer is: 5"
"Mark gets the radiator for 80% off, so he pays 20% of the original price. 20% of 400 is 0.2 x 400 = 80 dollars. 

Then, the mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour, so he pays 3 x 50 = 150 dollars.

So, Mark pays 80 + 150 = 230 dollars. 

230"
"Let's say the number of chickens is x and the number of cows is y. We know that x + y = 20 (because there are 20 animals in total). We also know that 2x + 4y = 70 (because chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs).

We can solve the first equation for x: x = 20 - y.

Now, we can plug this into the second equation: 2(20 - y) + 4y = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 40 - 2y + 4y = 70.

Combine like terms: 40 + 2y = 70.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 2y = 30.

Divide both sides by 2: y = 15.

Now that we know y, we can find x: x = 20 - y = 20 - 15 = 5.

So, there are 5 chickens."
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people.

First, we need to find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. 

7 pizzas * 8 slices = 56 slices

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. There are 4 people (Henry and his 3 friends).

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person

So, each person can have 14 slices."
