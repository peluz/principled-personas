"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

Now, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.

Janet sells these 9 eggs at $2 each, so she makes 9 * 2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we need half of 2, which is 1 bolt of white fiber.

So, the total number of bolts needed is 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts. 

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we need to first find the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

Let's calculate the new value of the house: 
New value = Original value + (Original value * 150%)
New value = $80,000 + ($80,000 * 1.5)
New value = $80,000 + $120,000
New value = $200,000

Now, we need to find the total cost of the house, which is the original price plus the repairs:
Total cost = Original price + Repairs
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the new value:
Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total number of meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sprint sessions he does in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total number of meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James does this 3 times a week, the total number of meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals. 

Morning meal: 15 cups
Afternoon meal: 25 cups
Total feed given in the morning and afternoon = 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Since Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per meal is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed per meal.

Total feed needed per meal: 60 cups
Total feed given in the morning and afternoon: 40 cups
Feed needed in the final meal = 60 - 40 = 20 cups

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
The fourth glass costs 60% of $1.8, which is 0.6 * $1.8 = $1.08. 
We can see that the cost of each glass is decreasing by 40% each time. 

The cost of the first glass is $5, the second is $3, the third is $1.8, the fourth is $1.08, the fifth is $0.64, the sixth is $0.384, the seventh is $0.2304, the eighth is $0.13824, the ninth is $0.082944, the tenth is $0.0497664, the eleventh is $0.02986584, the twelfth is $0.017949504, the thirteenth is $0.0107949304, the fourteenth is $0.00648696024, the fifteenth is $0.003876582144, the sixteenth is $0.002325949488.

Now, we add up the costs of all 16 glasses: 
$5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.64 + $0.384 + $0.2304 + $0.13824 + $0.082944 + $0.0497664 + $0.02986584 + $0.017949504 + $0.0107949304 + $0.00648696024 + $0.003876582144 + $0.002325949488 = $24.016.

"To find the number of sheep in Toulouse, we need to first find the number of sheep in Charleston. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle: 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total time it takes Carla to download the file, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file:
40% of 200 GB is 0.4 x 200 = 80 GB
Time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute = 80 / 2 = 40 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file:
60% of 200 GB is 0.6 x 200 = 120 GB
Time to download 120 GB at 2 GB/minute = 120 / 2 = 60 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file:
40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the distance traveled in each segment.

1. First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. 
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

2. Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move.
3. Next, he drives for 0.5 hours (half an hour) at 30 mph.
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

4. After that, he drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (4 - 2 - 0.5) at 80 mph.
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each segment:
Total distance = 180 + 0 + 15 + 120 = 315 miles

However, since John turned around after the first 3 hours, we need to subtract the distance he traveled from his starting point, which is 180 miles. 
So, the distance from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
Distance from home = 315 - 180 = 135 miles

The final answer is: 135"
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately, then add them together.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime rate is:
$10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

Her overtime earnings are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Her total earnings for the week are:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, which is 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads from each month together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 x $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 x $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 x $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total revenue it generates each year.

The initial cost of the tree is $90. 

Each year, the tree generates revenue from selling lemons. Since the tree grows 7 lemons per year and each lemon sells for $1.5, the total revenue per year is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

However, it also costs $3 to water and feed the tree each year. So, the net revenue per year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

To find out how many years it will take for the tree to start earning money, we need to find the break-even point, which is when the total revenue equals the initial cost of the tree. 

Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. The total revenue after 'x' years is $7.5x, and the total cost is $90. We set up the equation:

$7.5x = $90

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides by $7.5:

x = $90 / $7.5
x = 12

Since the tree will start earning money after the 13th year (when the total revenue exceeds the initial cost), it will take 13 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final answer is: 13"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, which is x/3.

At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2.

We know that after selling at all the houses, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, let's first simplify the fraction (x - x/3 - 2)/2:

(x - x/3 - 2)/2 = (2x/3 - 6)/2 = x/3 - 3

Now, let's rewrite the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 3) = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2x/3 - 2 + x/3 - 3 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2x/3 + x/3 - 5 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - x/3 - 5 = 5

Combine like terms:

2x/3 - 5 = 5

Add 5 to both sides:

2x/3 = 10

Multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is 4, and the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance is also 4. So, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the profit, we need to calculate the future value of each investment. 

Let's assume the merchant buys the jewelry and sells it at the end of the month. The future value of the jewelry can be calculated as follows:

Future Value of Jewelry = Current Value x (1 + Rate of Return)
= $5,000 x (1 + 0.025)
= $5,000 x 1.025
= $5,125

Now, let's calculate the future value of the electronic gadgets:

Future Value of Electronic Gadgets = Current Value x (1 + Rate of Return)
= $8,000 x (1 + 0.012)
= $8,000 x 1.012
= $8,096

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, we need to subtract the initial investment from the future value of each option:

Profit from Jewelry = Future Value of Jewelry - Initial Investment
= $5,125 - $5,000
= $125

Profit from Electronic Gadgets = Future Value of Electronic Gadgets - Initial Investment
= $8,096 - $8,000
= $96

The profit from the jewelry is higher, so the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit.

The final answer is: $125"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. 

On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance.

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- Hourly wage: $20
- Hours worked per week: 35
- Weeks worked per year: 50
- Annual hours worked: 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
- Annual earnings from teaching: 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- Hourly wage: $30
- Hours worked per week: 15
- Weeks worked per year: 50
- Annual hours worked: 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
- Annual earnings from coaching: 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
- Total annual salary: $35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

In 4 weeks, she will eat 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat in 4 weeks.

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much time Marissa has left to walk the remaining distance. 

She has walked 4 + 2 = 6 miles in 2 hours. 
The total distance is 12 miles, so the remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles. 

Since she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, and the total distance is 12 miles, the total time she needs to take is 12 / 4 = 3 hours. 

She has already taken 2 hours, so she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles. 

To find her required speed, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time: 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. 

Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is 6.67 liters.

Now, to find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, we need to calculate three-fifths of 15 liters.

Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters.

Now, we need to add the water from both drinks and subtract the 1 liter that was spilled.

Total water = 6.67 + 9 - 1 = 14.67 liters.

However, we are asked to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters. Since we have 10 liters of orange drink and 15 liters of pineapple drink, and we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, the total amount of liquid left is 10 - 1 + 15 = 24 liters.

The amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 14.67 liters."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Raymond was when Samantha was 31 years old. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, he was 31 - 6 = 25 years old when Samantha was 31.

Raymond had a son at the age of 23, so we need to find out how many years ago he was 23. Since Raymond was 25 when Samantha was 31, we subtract 25 - 23 = 2 years.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total number of DVDs sold, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought a total of 3 * 1 = 3 DVDs.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought a total of 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold to the first 5 customers: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

Since the last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, we don't need to add anything to the total.

The total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 7."
"To find the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter, we need to calculate the total time it burns and multiply it by the rate at which it melts.

The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

The rate at which the candle melts is 2 centimeters per hour.

So, the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter is 4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since Kyle bought the book with a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of the original price, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so it is x - 0.25x = 0.75x.

We are given that the discounted price is $19.50. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find the total cost of the items Marie ordered excluding the pizza, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples.

Cost of chicken meal: $12
Cost of 5 packs of milk: 5 * $3 = $15
Cost of 4 apples: 4 * $1.50 = $6
Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Now, we subtract the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount Marie paid to find the cost of the pizza boxes.
Cost of pizza boxes: $50 - $33 = $17

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can find the number of boxes by dividing the total cost of pizza boxes by the cost of each box.
Number of boxes of pizza: $17 / $8.50 = 2

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will go through 60 servings in 60 days. 

Each carton has 15 servings, so to find out how many cartons she buys, we divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton: 
60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton to find the total cost:
4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles. 

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance between the first and second stops = 60 - 45
Distance between the first and second stops = 15 miles

However, this is the distance from the first stop to the second stop, but we need to find the distance from the first stop to the second stop, which is the same as the distance from the first stop to the second stop. 

So, the distance between the first and second stops is 15 miles.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let the cost of the cheaper pair of heels be x dollars. Since the other pair costs twice as much, the cost of the more expensive pair of heels is 2x dollars.

We know that the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. So, we can write an equation to represent this:

x + 2x = boots - 5

Combine like terms:

3x = boots - 5

We also know that one pair of heels costs $33. Since this is the more expensive pair, we can set up an equation:

2x = 33

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 16.5

Now that we know the cost of the cheaper pair of heels, we can find the cost of the more expensive pair:

2x = 2 * 16.5 = 33

Now that we know the cost of both pairs of heels, we can find the cost of the boots:

3x = boots - 5
3 * 16.5 = boots - 5
49.5 = boots - 5
boots = 54.5

The final answer is: 54.5"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the current ages of Darrell and Allen. 

Let's assume the common ratio is x. So, Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x. 

The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162, so we can write the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find the current age of Allen: 
Allen's age = 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide it by the number of people.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first one: 80 / 2 = 40, then 40 + 20 = 60.
The third person guesses 25% more than the first one: 80 * 0.25 = 20, then 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 people, so we divide the total by 3 to find the average: 240 / 3 = 80.

"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent per dog. 

Number of dogs: 10
Time per dog: 0.5 hours

Total time per day = Number of dogs * Time per dog
Total time per day = 10 * 0.5
Total time per day = 5 hours

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the total time per day by 7 to find the total time per week.

Total time per week = Total time per day * 7
Total time per week = 5 * 7
Total time per week = 35 hours

"To find the number of gold coins, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We know that G = S + 30 (since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins) and that the total number of coins is 110 (G + S = 110).

We can substitute the first equation into the second one: S + 30 + S = 110. Combining like terms, we get 2S + 30 = 110. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2S = 80. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the first equation: G = 40 + 30 = 70.

"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately, and then add them together.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25 (which is the decimal form of 25%): 4 * 0.25 = 1. So, he scored 25% more points, which is 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The total points Mike scored is 9."
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first calculate how many yogurts he eats in 30 days and then find out the cost of those yogurts.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. In 30 days, he will eat 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since the yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys in 30 days. To do this, we divide the total number of yogurts by 4: 60 / 4 = 15 sets.

Now, we multiply the number of sets by the cost per set: 15 sets * $5.00 = $75.00.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many Lego sets John sold, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = $195.

Next, we need to find out how much money he spent on video games. He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so the total amount of money he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

Since he had $5 left after buying the video games, we can find out how much money he had before buying the video games by adding the money he had left to the money he spent on video games: $160 + $5 = $165.

Now, we can find out how much money he made from selling the Lego sets by subtracting the money he had before buying the video games from the total amount of money he made: $195 - $165 = $30.

However, this is not the amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets, but rather the amount of money he had left after buying the video games.

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his total running time and then divide the total distance by the total time.

John runs 3 hours the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

Total running time = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours

Since John runs 60 miles a week and 3 days a week, we can assume he runs 60 miles / 3 days = 20 miles per day.

However, to find the speed, we need to calculate the total running time in hours for the week. Since he runs 3 days a week, we can multiply the daily running time by 3. 

Total running time = 6 hours (calculated above) * 3 days = 18 hours

Now, we can calculate the speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.

Speed = Total distance / Total time = 60 miles / 18 hours = 3.33 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 3.33"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running and walking speeds. 

Given that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, we can find her running speed by multiplying her skipping speed by 2. 

Running speed = 2 * Skipping speed
Running speed = 2 * 3
Running speed = 6 miles per hour

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4.

Walking speed = Running speed / 4
Walking speed = 6 / 4
Walking speed = 1.5 miles per hour

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, in 6 hours, she will spend 2 hours running and 4 hours walking.

Distance traveled while running = Speed * Time
Distance traveled while running = 6 * 2
Distance traveled while running = 12 miles

Distance traveled while walking = Speed * Time
Distance traveled while walking = 1.5 * 4
Distance traveled while walking = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance traveled while running + Distance traveled while walking
Total distance traveled = 12 + 6
Total distance traveled = 18 miles

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to first find the age of Ben's iPhone. Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, and Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, and Ben's iPhone is 2 years old, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone, we need to multiply the original distance by 3. 

Original distance = 400 feet
Distance with gemstone = 400 * 3 = 1200 feet

Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1000 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the javelin. However, we need to find the distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames. 

Distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames = 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces. 

First, let's find the total number of pieces. Since Grandma Jones cut each pie into 8 pieces and she baked 5 pies, the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40.

Now, let's subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces to find out how many were taken by the guests. 

40 (total pieces) - 14 (remaining pieces) = 26

"To find out how many calories you can still consume, subtract the calories you've already consumed from your daily target: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, multiply the number of servings you can still consume by the total weight of the bag: 0.8 * 300 = 240 grams.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Since Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for 10 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks for 20 candles (2 sets of 10 candles). The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles, so the total revenue is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Now, let's calculate the net profit. The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Total number of articles written in 3 days = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to first determine how many Post-it notes she used in total. 

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work. To find out how many she had left, we subtract the number of Post-it notes she used from the number she started with: 80 - 220 = -140. However, this is not possible since you can't have a negative number of Post-it notes. This means that Candice must have had more Post-it notes than she initially thought. 

Since she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, we can set up an equation to find out how many Post-it notes she had initially: 80 + x = 220 + 23, where x is the number of Post-it notes in the package. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 80 + x = 243. To solve for x, we subtract 80 from both sides: x = 243 - 80. 

x = 163.

The final answer is: 163"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many blue ties John bought and then calculate the total cost of the red ties.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per tie:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, so the cost per red tie is:

Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + (50% of cost per blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on all ties by adding the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on all ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

1 foot is equal to 12 inches. 

So, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches):

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces."
"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. 

Number of floors: 15
Number of units per floor: 8

Total number of units = 15 * 8 = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units.

1/4 of the total units = (1/4) * 120 = 30

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs are produced per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since eggs are sold in dozens, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total amount Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the total time Tom spent traveling, we need to calculate the time he spent traveling from 1 to 4 PM and then add the time he spent traveling back.

First, let's find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he traveled at 10 miles per hour, we can use the formula: distance = speed * time. However, we don't know the time he spent traveling from 1 to 4 PM. 

Since he traveled from 1 to 4 PM, we can assume he traveled for 3 hours. 

distance = speed * time
distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find the time he spent traveling back. We know the distance is 30 miles and his speed is 6 miles per hour. 

time = distance / speed
time = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour
time = 5 hours

So, the total time Tom spent traveling is 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM) + 5 hours (back) = 8 hours.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the total weight of the comic books he removed. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removed 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books already removed weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, to find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the revenue earned on Thursday, we need to calculate the total revenue from truck tires and car tires separately and then add them together. 

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday = 6 * $60 = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday = 4 * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

To find the revenue earned on Friday, we need to calculate the total revenue from car tires.

Revenue from car tires on Friday = 12 * $40 = $480

Now, we need to compare the revenues of Thursday and Friday to find the day with higher revenue. 

Thursday's revenue: $520
Friday's revenue: $480

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 

To find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the revenue of the day with lower revenue from the revenue of the day with higher revenue.

Difference in revenue = $520 - $480 = $40

The final answer is: $40"

There are 1 bad oranges and 20% of 25 oranges are unripe. 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges are unripe.

Now, we add the number of bad and unripe oranges to find the total number of oranges that are not good. 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) = 6 oranges are not good.

Now, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges. 
25 (total) - 6 (not good) = 19 oranges are good.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 30 years and then find 5% of that value.

Marcy works for 30 years, but she only gets the 5% increase after 20 years. So, for the first 20 years, she gets the standard $50,000 pension. For the remaining 10 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension.

First, let's calculate the total value of the pension for the first 20 years:
20 years * $50,000/year = $1,000,000

Now, let's calculate the value of the pension for the remaining 10 years:
5% of the value of the pension = 0.05 * $1,000,000 = $50,000/year

However, this is the increase in the pension, not the total pension. To find the total pension, we need to add this increase to the original pension:
$50,000 (original) + $50,000 (increase) = $100,000/year

So, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $100,000/year.

The final answer is: $100,000"
"To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately and then add them together.

The first half of the year is 6 months, and the second half of the year is also 6 months. 

The initial amount charged per month is $140. 

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the company charged her 10% less than the initial amount. 
10% of $140 is 0.1 * $140 = $14. 
So, the amount charged for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126 per month.
For the second half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $126 = $756.

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $756 = $1596.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to determine the car's miles per gallon (mpg) rating. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled since the last fill-up (100 miles) by the amount of gas used (4 gallons).

mpg = distance / gas used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the car's mpg rating, we can calculate the total distance Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity (12 gallons) by the mpg rating.

total distance = tank capacity * mpg
total distance = 12 gallons * 25 miles/gallon
total distance = 300 miles

"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to subtract the total amount she received from her allowance from the total amount she has at the end of 8 weeks.

Let's denote the initial amount of money Bailey had as 'x'. 

Bailey received a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total amount she received from her allowance is 5 * 8 = $40.

At the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. 

So, the equation to find the initial amount of money Bailey had is: x + 40 = 100.

To solve for x, we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation: x = 100 - 40.

x = 60.

Judy teaches 5 classes per day on weekdays, which is 5 classes * 5 days = 25 classes. 
She also teaches 8 classes on Saturday. 
So, the total number of classes in a week is 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students per week is 33 classes * 15 students = 495 students.

Judy charges $15 per student, so the total amount she makes in a week is 495 students * $15/student = $7,425.

Next, let's calculate the interest charged for 3 months at 2% per month:
Interest per month = 2% of $750 = 0.02 * $750 = $15
Total interest for 3 months = $15 * 3 = $45

Now, let's add the interest to the original price:
Total cost = $750 + $45 = $795

Since Shiela is paying in installments, we need to divide the total cost by 3 months:
Monthly payment = $795 / 3 = $265

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year. 

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. So, the total amount of dog food eaten in the first 180 days is 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.

The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the total amount of dog food eaten in the rest of the year is 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food eaten in the first year is 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package. 

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers is the better deal.

To find the cost of 18 flowers at the better price, we multiply the cost per flower by the number of flowers: 18 * $0.5 = $9.

To find the cost of 18 flowers at the original price, we need to find the number of packages of 3 flowers that can be bought with 18 flowers and the number of packages of 2 flowers that can be bought with the remaining flowers. 

18 / 3 = 6 packages of 3 flowers, which is 6 * 3 = 18 flowers. The remaining flowers are 18 - 18 = 0, so there are no packages of 2 flowers left.

The cost of 18 flowers at the original price is 6 * $2.50 = $15.

The amount of money saved is $15 - $9 = $6.

"To solve this problem, let's use algebra. Let's say the number of games they lost is x. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after the 5th year and then calculate the increase for the next three years.

Initial salary: $600
Increase: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 5 years: $600 + $60 = $660

Now, we need to calculate the increase for the next three years. The increase will be 10% of the current salary, which is $660.

Increase for the 6th year: 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66

"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

Number of invited guests = 16
Number of guests who don't show up = 1/4 * 16 = 4
Number of guests who will attend = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we can multiply the number of guests who will attend by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

Number of gift bags needed = 12 * 0.75 = 9

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. We can find the combined number of dogs and cats by adding the number of dogs and cats.

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

Now, we can find the number of rabbits by subtracting 12 from the combined number of dogs and cats.

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first calculate how many potted plants she has in total. 

She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she has 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants. 

She also received 18 new potted plants from the nursery, so now she has 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.

Tomorrow, she will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to her friends and family, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants she will have left, we need to subtract the number of potted plants she gave away from the total number of potted plants she had. 

So, 98 - 40 = 58.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and add them up.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, which is 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.
The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, and since the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.
The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings: 
20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we need to add up the pages from all his textbooks. 

4 pages (Science) + 20 pages (Social Studies) + 7 pages (History) + 8 pages (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we need to subtract those from the total to find out how many pages are left to read. 

39 pages - 15 pages = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average per day, we need to divide the remaining pages by the number of days.

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately, and then add them together.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one before bed). Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of soda with dinner, but he still drinks 3 glasses of water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed. So, he drinks 3 glasses of water on each weekend day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water on weekends.

In total, John drinks 20 glasses of water on weekdays and 6 glasses of water on weekends. So, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is 20 + 6 = 26.

"To find out how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

First, we need to find out how many 3-mile sections are in 42 miles. We can do this by dividing 42 by 3.

42 miles / 3 miles per section = 14 sections

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile section, we multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section.

14 sections * 10 minutes per section = 140 minutes

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how many pieces Poppy placed, we need to calculate a quarter of 1000. 

A quarter of 1000 is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after Poppy placed 250 pieces. 

1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left.

Then, her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. 

A third of 750 is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after her mom placed 250 pieces. 

750 - 250 = 500 pieces left.

"To find the inner volume of one box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the dimensions of the box. 

The length of the inner box is 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side).
The width of the inner box is 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side).
The height of the inner box is 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side).

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the length, width, and height: 
Inner volume of one box = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:
Total inner volume = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To solve this problem, let's break down the total time Frankie watched TV each day and the total time he watched in 30-minute episodes.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 episodes of 1-hour shows, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's call the number of episodes x. So, the total time he watched on Wednesday is 0.5x hours.

On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 0.5 hours of a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours.

On Friday, he watched 2 episodes of 1-hour shows, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

The total time Frankie watched TV is 7 hours. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7

Combine like terms:

5.5 + 0.5x = 7

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

0.5x = 1.5

Divide both sides by 0.5:

x = 3

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year. 
2. He baked 15 more cookies than he meant to.
3. He dropped 5 cookies, and now has a total of 110 cookies.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as 'x'. Since he wants to make twice as many this year, he intended to bake 2x cookies.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the total number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. This can be represented as:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year. 

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards, and then subtract the cashback rewards.

The cost of gas per gallon is $3.00, and the person buys 10 gallons. 

Total cost of gas = cost per gallon * number of gallons
Total cost of gas = $3.00 * 10
Total cost of gas = $30.00

The cashback rewards are $.20 per gallon, and the person buys 10 gallons.

Total cashback rewards = cashback per gallon * number of gallons
Total cashback rewards = $.20 * 10
Total cashback rewards = $2.00

Now, we subtract the total cashback rewards from the total cost of gas to find the final cost.

Final cost = Total cost of gas - Total cashback rewards
Final cost = $30.00 - $2.00
Final cost = $28.00

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each person, we need to multiply the width by the length of each roll-up.

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 roll-ups long = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 roll-ups long = 42 roll-ups

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we need to add the total number of roll-ups eaten by each person and divide by 2.

Total roll-ups eaten = 48 + 42 = 90
Average roll-ups eaten = 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to calculate the rate at which the boat is taking on water and then multiply it by the total time it took to reach the shore.

First, let's find the rate at which the boat is taking on water. It takes 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, and it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet. 

Since 20 feet is twice 10 feet, the boat will take on twice the amount of water, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters in 16 seconds.

Now, we need to find out how many 16-second intervals are there in 64 seconds. To do this, we divide 64 by 16, which equals 4.

Since there are 4 intervals of 16 seconds in 64 seconds, and the boat takes on 4 liters of water in each 16-second interval, the total amount of water the boat takes on in 64 seconds is 4 * 4 = 16 liters.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

There are 4 teachers, each with 2 lessons per day. So, the total number of lessons per day is 4 * 2 = 8 lessons.

Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 * 3 = 24 times.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of flowers Ryan has, we need to calculate the total number of flowers he planted and subtract the ones that did not grow.

Ryan plants 2 flowers a day. After 15 days, he would have planted 2 * 15 = 30 flowers.

However, 5 of these flowers did not grow. So, we need to subtract 5 from the total number of flowers planted.

Total flowers = 30 - 5 = 25

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

From point 1, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

From point 2, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This means that the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 300 / 50 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total cost of the lumber, we need to calculate the cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards and the 4 x 4 x 10 boards separately and then add them together.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 per board = $100.

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. 

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 per board.
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 per board.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.
The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 per board = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

"To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to first find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 13 = 20. 

Since the total amount of sugar and water used is 120, we can set up a proportion to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used. 

Let x be the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used. The proportion is 7/20 = x/120. 

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 7 * 120 = 20x. 

This simplifies to 840 = 20x. 

Now, we can divide both sides by 20 to solve for x: x = 840 / 20 = 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"To find the total amount John paid, we need to calculate the cost of the shoes for all 3 children. 

First, we find the cost of shoes for one child: 2 pairs * $60 = $120.

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to first find the total number of vehicles that were already at the port on the first day. 

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles that were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. If we let Lylah's salary be x, then Adrien's salary is 1.3x (since 100% + 30% = 130%, or 1.3 times).

We are also given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000. Since Adrien's salary four years ago was 1.3x, we can set up the equation:

1.3x = 40000

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 1.3:

x = 40000 / 1.3
x = 30769.23

So Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30769.23.

Now, we know that Adrien's salary increased by 40% over the four years. This means his new salary is 140% of his old salary (100% + 40% = 140%, or 1.4 times). We can calculate his new salary as follows:

New Adrien's salary = 1.4 * 40000
New Adrien's salary = 56000

Similarly, Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage, so her new salary is 140% of her old salary:

New Lylah's salary = 1.4 * 30769.23
New Lylah's salary = 43055.12

Now, we can calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:

Total salary = New Adrien's salary + New Lylah's salary
Total salary = 56000 + 43055.12
Total salary = 99055.12

The final answer is: $99055"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to first calculate how many sheets he uses in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, the total number of sheets he uses in a week is:
2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of sheets Miguel uses in a week by 4 to get the total number of sheets he uses in a month:
60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then add them together.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 
Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples.
Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

So, Morisette brought 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.
Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

The total number of fruits they have is 13 + 14 = 27.

"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to break down her sleep pattern.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

There are 5 days in the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), so the total hours she slept in those days is 5 * 7 = 35 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept throughout the week:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday and Wednesday: 2 * 6 = 12 hours
- Thursday to Sunday: 35 hours

Total hours = 8 + 12 + 35 = 55 hours

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours:
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Now, let's calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distances together to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:
Total distance = Distance at 10 miles per hour + Distance at 5 miles per hour
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of letters already in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is x.

Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, which means she stamps 60 / 3 = 20 letters.

The total number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters now is the sum of the letters already there and the letters Jennie stamped, which is x + 20.

We are given that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, so we can set up the equation:

x + 20 = 30

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

x = 30 - 20
x = 10

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is: 10"

1. Julia initially had an unknown number of spoons, but we know she was out of them, so let's call the number of spoons in the package she bought ""x"".
2. Julia bought a package of x spoons.
3. Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia, so now she has x + 5 spoons.
4. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so now she has (x + 5) - 3 spoons left.
5. When she set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons, so (x + 5) - 3 = 12.

Now, let's solve the equation:

x + 5 - 3 = 12
x + 2 = 12
x = 10

"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages. 

First, we know that Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 
Then, we know that he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. So, the number of fish sausages is 38 + 6 = 44.

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages: 38 + 44 = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we need to add the number of friends Lily has to the number of friends Amy has. 

Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily has 50 friends, Amy has 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

Now, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120.

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to determine the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity.

1. The cost of each pepper is given as $15.
2. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, so the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.
3. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each item:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

"To find the total time spent by doctors, we need to multiply the number of patients by the average time spent per patient. 

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total minutes to hours.

12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The hospital pays the doctors $150/hour, so the total cost is:

200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

The hospital charges the patients $200/hour, so the total revenue is:

200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

The profit is the difference between the revenue and the cost:

$40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We already know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. 

So, the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles. 

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage for the three days: 41 - 28 = 13 miles.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

First, let's find out how many questions Mark completed in 8 hours: 
8 hours * 5 questions/hour = 40 questions

Since Mark completed 40 questions in 8 hours, he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete in the first test.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.

Now, let's find out how many questions Mark completed in 6 hours:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 700 bees in total.
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees.
3. There are twice as many babies as queens.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of babies as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

From point 3, we know that B = 2Q.

From point 2, we know that W = 2B.

Substituting B = 2Q into W = 2B, we get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

Now, we know that the total number of bees is 700, so W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting B = 2Q and W = 4Q into the equation, we get 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know Q = 100, we can find B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400.

"To find out who will win the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet for both Steve and Tim. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, we can convert their distances as follows:

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school:

Steve's time: distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes to get home and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will win the race. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total number of fries eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
   Now, the total number of fries eaten by Dave, the seagull, and the pigeons is 21 + 9 = 30.
4. A raccoon ate two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's denote the total number of fries initially as x. 
   After the seagull and pigeons ate, the remaining fries are x - 30.
   The raccoon ate 2/3 of (x - 30), which is (2/3)(x - 30).
   The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30).
   Simplifying this, we get (1/3)(x - 30).
5. After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 behind. 
   So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.
   Solving for x, we get (1/3)(x - 30) = 6.
   Multiplying both sides by 3, we get x - 30 = 18.

"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes per day, each lasting 1 hour. So, the total hours per day for these days is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. Since there are 3 days, the total hours per week for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes per day, each lasting 2 hours. So, the total hours per day for these days is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. Since there are 2 days, the total hours per week for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. So, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

The final answer is: 272"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches, since the other lengths are given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together:

1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches

Since we want the total length in feet, we need to convert the total length from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

3360 / 12 = 280 feet

The final answer is: 280"
"To find the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to calculate the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape per month and then multiply it by 2.

Monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.
Gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
Baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, we add the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. 

To find the total distance Kelly ran, we add the distance she ran back and forth and the distance she ran to the 40-yard line and back. So, the total distance Kelly ran is 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance. So, 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total amount Raphael spent, we need to calculate the cost of the pens, notebooks, and the bond paper separately and then add them together.

"To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that hid under the rock from the number of tadpoles that came out from under the lily pad.

Initially, Finn saw 11 tadpoles. 
6 tadpoles came out from under the lily pad, so now there are 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles.
Then, 2 tadpoles hid under the rock, so we subtract 2 from 17: 17 - 2 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the depth of the water on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The initial depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet.
2. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.
3. On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two-thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3.

To multiply a number by a fraction, we multiply the number by the numerator (2) and then divide by the denominator (3). 

24 * 2 = 48
48 / 3 = 16

So, the depth of the water on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we need to add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish he caught. 

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin.
Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
Total fish caught = 19 + 13
Total fish caught = 32

The final answer is: 32"

"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then add them together.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

One red car costs $4. There are 5 red cars, so the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

The total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we add the cost of the doll, the red cars, and the action figures together: $15 (doll) + $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) = $50.

The total worth of all the toys is $50.

"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself:

Income lost = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's compare this to the cost of hiring the accountant:

Cost of hiring the accountant = $90

Since the income lost is greater than the cost of hiring the accountant, Jackie will actually be better off hiring the accountant. To find out how much more money she'll have, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the income she'll lose:

Difference = Income lost - Cost of hiring the accountant
= $105 - $90
= $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation:

S = 2B

In 2 years, their ages will be B + 2 and S + 2. The sum of their ages will be 28, so we can write another equation:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the second equation, we get:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can find the total age of the four birds by adding their ages together: 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirtytwo) = 51

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much they made in total from selling lemonade. 

Let's denote the number of gallons they made as 'g'. Since they get 20 glasses per gallon and each glass is sold for $0.50, the total revenue from selling lemonade is 20 * 0.5 * g = 10g dollars.

The cost of making lemonade is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar per gallon, so the total cost is 3 + 2 = $5 per gallon.

Since they made a profit of $25, we can set up the equation: 
10g - 5g = 25
This simplifies to 5g = 25.

To find the number of gallons, we divide both sides by 5:
g = 25 / 5
g = 5

Now that we know they made 5 gallons, we can find the total cost of lemons:
Cost of lemons = 3 * 5 = $15

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. According to the problem, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is 4x.

It's also given that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. So, the number of white carnations (x) is equal to 200 divided by 5, which is 40.

Now that we know the number of white carnations (x) is 40, we can find the number of red roses, which is 4x. So, the number of red roses is 4 * 40 = 160.

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 3, we know Jan's current age is 30. 

Two years ago, Jan's age would have been 30 - 2 = 28.

From point 2, we know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 28 / 2 = 14. 

So, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Since Mark was 19 two years ago, his current age would be 19 + 2 = 21.

From point 1, we know Jean is two years older than Mark. Therefore, Jean's current age is 21 + 2 = 23.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then find the difference between these two probabilities.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 or 25%.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters) and the total number of straw pieces given to them. 

Let's start by finding the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters. Since there are 10 cages of hamsters and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we know that the total number of straw pieces given to the small rodents is 160, and 50 of those pieces were given to the hamsters. So, the number of straw pieces given to the rats is 160 - 50 = 110.

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, let's assume the number of rats in each cage is 'r'. The total number of rats is 3r. Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw pieces given to the rats is 3r * 6 = 18r.

We know that the total number of straw pieces given to the rats is 110, so we can set up the equation 18r = 110. To solve for 'r', we divide both sides by 18:

r = 110 / 18
r = 6.11 (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of rats in each cage, and the question does not specify that we should round down. We can assume that the number of rats in each cage is a whole number, but we need to find the exact number of rats in each cage. 

However, since the question asks for the number of rats in each cage, we can assume that the number of rats in each cage is a whole number. We can try to find the exact number of rats in each cage by finding the factors of 110 that are divisible by 18. 

The factors of 110 are 1, 2, 5, 10, 11, 22, 55, and 110. The factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The initial amount owed is $100.
The monthly interest rate is 2% or 0.02.

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

The total interest is $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

The total amount Mandy should pay is the initial amount plus the total interest: $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

Rounding to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total cost of buying the bags of wheat and the total cost of transporting them. 

Let's assume the number of bags bought is 'x'. 

The cost of buying the bags is $20x. 
The cost of transporting the bags is $2x. 
The total cost is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The trader sold the bags at $30 each, so the total revenue is $30x.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $400. 
So, we can set up the equation: 
$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:
$8x = $400

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides by 8:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total minutes he collects peaches and then multiply it by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the total minutes by the number of peaches per minute:

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks needs per day, we first need to calculate the total pounds of insects they need per week. 

The total pounds of insects the ducks need per week is 3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total pounds of insects needed per week by 7 to find out how many pounds they need per day. 

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees over 10 years, considering the trees he plants, chops down, and the ones that die.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees.

Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, resulting in a net gain of 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Over 10 years, the net gain would be 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

So, the total number of trees after 10 years would be 50 (initial trees) + 80 (net gain) = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we calculate 30% of 130:
30% of 130 = 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees.

Now, subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees:
130 - 39 = 91 trees.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find the number of pink and white flamingos, we need to break down the events step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, there are now 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday, the neighbors added another 18 pink flamingos to the collection. Now, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

The total number of flamingos is 6 (white) + 30 (pink) = 36.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 (pink) - 6 (white) = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to first calculate the total cost of the crayons. Since one crayon costs $2 and she needs 5 crayons, the total cost will be 5 * $2 = $10.

Since Violetta prepared $20 for the purchase, we subtract the total cost from the amount she prepared to find the change: $20 - $10 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser, since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. 

Cost of a pencil: $1.20
Cost of an eraser: $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. 

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to calculate the total amount of carrots distributed and subtract that from the initial amount.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total carrots distributed = 2 pounds/restaurant * 40 restaurants = 80 pounds

Now, subtract the total distributed from the initial amount:

Initial amount = 200 pounds
Total distributed = 80 pounds
Carrots not used = Initial amount - Total distributed = 200 - 80 = 120 pounds

The final answer is: 120"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokemon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the number of cards she initially had: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months: (60 + 40) * 2 = 100 cards.

To find the total number of cards Elaine has now, we need to add the cards she had initially to the cards she collected in each month: 20 + 60 + 40 + 100 = 220.

The final answer is: 220"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Mark edits an equal number of sentences for two publishers.
2. Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays.
3. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence.
4. Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week.

Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, let's say the number of sentences he edits for each publisher is x. Then, the total number of sentences he edits is 2x, which is equal to 1000.

2x = 1000
x = 500

So, Mark edits 500 sentences for each publisher.

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, and Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, Publisher B pays 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence.

The amount Mark makes from Publisher A is 500 * 5 = 2500 cents.
The amount Mark makes from Publisher B is 500 * 10 = 5000 cents.

The total amount Mark makes in a week is 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

The final answer is: 7500"
"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets in a day and then multiply it by the amount of water in each pail.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water he gets every day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

The final answer is: 55"
"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to calculate his earnings from the award and his increased salary.

The award has a one-time monetary reward of $5000.

For the 5% raise in salary, we need to calculate the increase in his weekly salary. 
5% of $2000 is 0.05 * $2000 = $100.
So, his new weekly salary is $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Since he got the award on the first day of the year, he will earn the increased salary for all 52 weeks of the year. 
His total earnings from the increased salary are $2100 * 52 = $109200.

His total earnings for the year are the sum of the award and his increased salary: $5000 + $109200 = $110200.

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for the sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni and cheese separately and then add them together.

For the sandwiches, Carl ate 7 days' worth of sandwiches (since it's a week) and used 2 slices per sandwich. So, the total slices used for sandwiches = 7 * 2 = 14.

For the omelets, Carl ate 3 days' worth of omelets and used 3 slices per omelet (since he used one more slice per omelet than per sandwich). So, the total slices used for omelets = 3 * 3 = 9.

For the macaroni and cheese, Carl used 8 slices.

Now, let's add the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni and cheese together: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31.

"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of blue and red pens she bought and add them to the initial number of pens she had.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she had a total of 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens.

She bought 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, let's add the number of blue and red pens to the initial number of pens: 32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98 pens.

Next, we add up the scores of the first five tests: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338.

Now, we subtract the sum of the first five tests from the total score needed: 558 - 338 = 220.

This means Brinley needs a score of 220 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike, we need to calculate the total kilometers for the first four weeks and the total kilometers for the next three weeks, and then add them together.

For the first four weeks, Michael rode 25 kilometers each time, 5 times a week. So, the total kilometers for the first four weeks is:
25 km * 5 times/week * 4 weeks = 25 * 5 * 4 = 500 km

For the next three weeks, Michael rode 60 kilometers each time, 2 times a week. So, the total kilometers for the next three weeks is:
60 km * 2 times/week * 3 weeks = 60 * 2 * 3 = 360 km

Now, we add the total kilometers for the first four weeks and the next three weeks:
500 km + 360 km = 860 km

The final answer is: 860"
"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the weight of the chocolate bars. Since there are 25 chocolate bars and each weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Next, let's find the weight of the candied apples. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is:
40g / 2 = 20g

Now, let's find the total weight of the candied apples. Since there are 80 candied apples and each weighs 20g, the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Finally, let's add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

The final answer is: 2600"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the cost of one cup as 'x'. 

Since twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, we can set up the equation:

20 * 12 * x = 6 * 6000 - 1200

First, let's simplify the equation by calculating the total cost of half a dozen plates:
6 * 6000 = 36000

Now, let's rewrite the equation:
240x = 36000 - 1200

Next, let's simplify the right side of the equation:
240x = 34800

Now, let's solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 240:
x = 34800 / 240

x = 145

The final answer is: 145"
"To find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs to earn and subtract the amount she already has.

The total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is $30 (jacket) + $20 (shoes) + $20 (shoes) = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn. 

Let's calculate how much she earns from babysitting: 4 times babysitting * $5 per time = $20.

Now, let's calculate how much more money she needs: $70 (total cost) - $10 (initial savings) - $20 (babysitting earnings) = $40.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we need to divide the remaining amount by the amount she earns from mowing the lawn: $40 / $4 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We know that W = R + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can set up the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. On the first day, Sloane counts 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counts 50 more customers than the first day, so she counts 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
3. The total number of customers by the third day is 500.
4. To find the number of customers on the third day, we need to subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day. 
   Total customers by the third day = Customers on the first day + Customers on the second day + Customers on the third day
   500 = 100 + 150 + Customers on the third day
   Customers on the third day = 500 - 250
   Customers on the third day = 250

The final answer is: 250"
"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of water loss for both pools is 8 gallons/minute (4 gallons/minute each).

In 4 minutes, the total amount of water lost from both pools is 8 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 32 gallons.

The big pool initially had 2x gallons of water and lost 32 gallons in 4 minutes, so the amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 32 gallons.

The small pool initially had x gallons of water and lost 32 gallons in 4 minutes, so the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 32 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 32 = 4(x - 32)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 32 = 4x - 128

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-32 = 2x - 128

Adding 128 to both sides:

96 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

48 = x

So the initial amount of water in the small pool was 48 gallons. 

Since the small pool lost 32 gallons in 4 minutes, the amount of water in the small pool now is 48 - 32 = 16 gallons.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn, which is the sum of the cost of the shoes and the belt. 

Total cost = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Since Lori earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours to work = 44 hours

"To find the remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months. 

Janeth pays $165 per month for 12 months, so the total amount she pays is:
$165 * 12 = $1980

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. The additional amount is:
10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200

So, the total amount Janeth needs to pay is:
$2000 (initial amount) + $200 (additional amount) = $2200

Since Janeth pays $1980 in 12 months, the remaining balance will be:
$2200 (total amount) - $1980 (paid amount) = $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to determine the number of dahlias and add it to the number of roses. 

First, we know there are 4 roses. 
Then, we are told there are 7 more dahlias than roses. So, the number of dahlias is 4 (number of roses) + 7 = 11.

Now, we add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to find their current ages and then add 3 to each age. 

Given that Harriet is 21 years old now, and Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). 

In three years, their ages will be: 
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3: 
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored. 

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Naomi scored 68 points. Half of 68 is 34. 10 more than 34 is 44. So Yuri scored 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. Naomi scored 68 points. 17 more than 68 is 85. So Brianna scored 85 points.

Now we know that Naomi scored 68 points, Yuri scored 44 points, and Brianna scored 85 points. We also know that the total number of points scored by the four students is 251. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total number of points.

Total points = 251
Points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197
Points scored by Jojo = Total points - Points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna
Points scored by Jojo = 251 - 197

"To find the amount of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters, we subtract 90 from the initial amount of water in the tank.

Initial water in the tank = 120 liters
Water used by Celine = 90 liters
Water left in the tank = 120 - 90 = 30 liters

Since Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left, we multiply the amount of water left by 2.

Rainwater collected = 2 * 30 = 60 liters

Now, we add the water left in the tank and the rainwater collected to find the total amount of water in the tank.

Total water in the tank = Water left in the tank + Rainwater collected
= 30 + 60
= 90 liters

"To find out how many vines Steve needs, we first need to determine how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply this by 7 to get the total number of tomatoes he eats per week.

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can assume his girlfriend eats half the amount he does. So, his girlfriend eats 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes per day. 

3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

The total number of tomatoes they both eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week.

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes per vine to find out how many vines they need.

63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many candies Robert has, and then compare John's candies to James'. 

Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can set up an equation: 

2 * Robert's candies = 54

To find Robert's candies, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: 

Robert's candies = 54 / 2
Robert's candies = 27

Now we know Robert has 27 candies. Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, we can find James' candies by adding 6 to Robert's candies: 

James' candies = Robert's candies + 6
James' candies = 27 + 6
James' candies = 33

Now we can compare John's candies to James': 

John's candies - James' candies = 54 - 33
John's candies - James' candies = 21

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dolly has 2 books and reads her own 2 books, so she reads a total of 2 + 2 = 4 books.
2. Pandora has 1 book and reads her own 1 book, and also reads Dolly's 2 books, so she reads a total of 1 + 2 = 3 books.
3. In total, they read 4 (Dolly's books) + 3 (Pandora's books) = 7 books.

However, this counts each book twice (once for each person who read it). To get the total number of books read, we need to divide this total by 2, since each book was read by two people.

So, the total number of books read is 7 / 2 = 3.5.

However, since you can't read a fraction of a book, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as you can't read a book partially.

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and then multiply it by the time it takes him to write one page.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike writes in a week. He has 3 pen pals left, and each of them sends 2 letters a week. So, the total number of letters he receives is 3 * 2 = 6 letters.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he writes in a week is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for each day, then multiply it by the number of days, and finally multiply it by the number of weeks. 

The makeup artist charges $250 an hour and works 6 hours a day. 
Cost per day = 250 * 6 = $1500

She needs it done 4 times a week for 5 weeks. 
Total days = 4 * 5 = 20 days

Total cost before discount = 1500 * 20 = $30,000

After the movie is done, she gives a 10% discount. 
Discount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * 30,000 = $3000

Total cost after discount = $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find out how much each person paid, we need to first calculate the total cost of the party supplies. 

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total. 

To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3.

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, each weighing 50 pounds. So, the total weight of onions is:
4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost is:
200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"To find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday and Tuesday, we need to first determine how many cookies her sister ate on each day. 

Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday. 
On Tuesday, she ate 13 cookies. 

Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday. 
On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

The total number of cookies Sue ate is 20 + 26 = 46 cookies. 
The total number of cookies her sister ate is 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories. 
Her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed is 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

The total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

We already know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

The number of girls in the third class is the total number of girls in the school minus the number of girls in the first two classes, which is 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% girls, the number of boys in the school is also 30. The number of boys in the first two classes is 60 - 27 = 33. 

The number of boys in the third class is the total number of boys in the school minus the number of boys in the first two classes, which is 30 - 33 is incorrect, we need to recalculate the number of boys in the first two classes. The total number of students in the first two classes is 20 + 20 = 40. The number of girls in the first two classes is 27. The number of boys in the first two classes is 40 - 27 = 13. 

The number of boys in the third class is the total number of boys in the school minus the number of boys in the first two classes, which is 30 - 13 = 17.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's represent the number of cougars killed today as 'x'. Then, the number of wolves killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12 to find the number of wolves killed today. Solving for x, we get x = 4.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of wolves killed today by multiplying 3 and x, which is 3 * 4 = 12.

To find the total number of animals killed, we add the number of animals killed last night and today. The total number of wolves killed is 10 + 12 = 22. The total number of cougars killed is 15 + 12 = 27.

The total number of animals killed is 22 + 27 = 49.

"To find out how many times Anne went down the water slide, we need to calculate 30% of 30, which is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, she went down 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, so Robert went down 4 * 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

To find out how many cows each stall got, we divide 40 by 10: 40 / 10 = 4. 

So, each stall got 4 new cows. 

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows. 

To find out how many cows are in 8 stalls, we multiply 24 by 8: 24 * 8 = 192.

The final answer is: 192"
"To find the total amount of money Brady has, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill, and then add them together.

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections and then multiply it by the weight of each section. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of 8000 from the total weight. To find 30% of 8000, we multiply 8000 by 0.3: 8000 * 0.3 = 2400.

Now, we subtract 2400 from the total weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to calculate the total cost of the overdue books and add the flat fee.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
2. Andrea has 52 apples, so Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
3. Jamal has half as many bananas as apples, so Jamal has 44 / 2 = 22 bananas.
4. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, but this is not possible since he has fewer bananas than apples. This statement seems to be incorrect or misleading. However, we can proceed with the information we have.
5. Since Jamal has 22 bananas, and the statement about bananas being 4 more than apples is incorrect, we will ignore this statement and focus on the other information.
6. We know Andrea has 52 apples and Jamal has 44 apples.
7. To find the total number of fruits, we need to add the number of apples and bananas both Andrea and Jamal have. 
   - Andrea has 52 apples and an unknown number of bananas.
   - Jamal has 44 apples and 22 bananas.

Since we don't know how many bananas Andrea has, we need to find that first. However, we can't find it directly from the given information. But we can use the fact that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, which is incorrect, but we can use the fact that he has half as many bananas as apples. 

However, we can use the fact that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. Since Jamal has 22 bananas, Andrea has 22 / 2 = 11 bananas.

Now we can find the total number of fruits:
- Andrea has 52 apples and 11 bananas.
- Jamal has 44 apples and 22 bananas.

Total number of fruits = (52 + 11) + (44 + 22) = 63 + 66 = 129.

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we first need to determine how many cups of flour are needed for each day. 

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups of flour are needed for 36 cookies. 

First, we find out how many dozens of cookies Carla is making today: 36 / 12 = 3. 

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, we multiply the number of dozens by 2: 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour needed for today.

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. We find out how many dozens of cookies Carla is making tomorrow: 30 / 12 = 2.5. 

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, we multiply the number of dozens by 2: 2.5 * 2 = 5 cups of flour needed for tomorrow.

To find the total amount of flour needed, we add the flour needed for today and tomorrow: 6 + 5 = 11 cups of flour.

"To find the total dollar amount of two-thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first calculate two-thirds of 9,300. 

Two-thirds of 9,300 can be calculated as (2/3) * 9,300. 

To do this, we multiply 9,300 by 2 and then divide by 3. 

9,300 * 2 = 18,600 

18,600 / 3 = 6,200 

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62.00 

The final answer is: $62.00"

"To find the number of trees in each yard, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Chris has 6 trees.
2. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has. 
   So, Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.
3. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has.
   First, we find twice the number of trees Ferdinand has: 2 * 3 = 6.
   Then, we add 5 to that number: 6 + 5 = 11.
   So, Harry has 11 trees.

Now, to find the difference in the number of trees between Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard:
11 (Harry's trees) - 3 (Ferdinand's trees) = 8

"To find the total price of the house, we need to add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee. 

The selling price is $350,000. 
The brokerage fee is 5% of $350,000, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.
The transfer fee is 12% of $350,000, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find out how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

"To find the time it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees, we need to calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 x 20 = 8 minutes. 
So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees.

It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 20 (to heat up to 300 degrees) + 28 (to heat up to 400 degrees) + 23 (to cook) = 71 minutes.

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to determine the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is a 1800-stitch project, the total number of stitches used for the body and the sleeves is 1800 - 270 = 1530 stitches.

The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches, so the number of stitches used for the sleeves is 1530 - 900 = 630 stitches.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 
2/5 of 80 cards had the letter A, so (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards had the letter A.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B: 
1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B. The remaining cards are 80 - 32 = 48. So, (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards had the letter B.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C: 
5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C. The remaining cards are 48 - 24 = 24. So, (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards had the letter C.

Now, we add the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C: 
32 + 24 + 15 = 71 cards.

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:

"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots per cobra: 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

Since the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras, we divide the number of spots per cobra by 2 to find the number of spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

To find the total number of spots on the mambas, we multiply the number of mambas by the number of spots per mamba: 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

Now, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas to find the combined total: 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

"To find out how many cents Kelly has initially, we need to calculate the total value of her quarters and dimes. 

Each quarter is worth 25 cents, and she has 5 quarters, so the total value of her quarters is 5 x 25 = 125 cents. 

Each dime is worth 10 cents, and she has 2 dimes, so the total value of her dimes is 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

The total value of her coins is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, we need to subtract the cost of the pop from the total value of her coins to find out how many cents she has left.

So, 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the number of rows of 5-star, we first need to find the total number of stars in the flag. 

The flag has three rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24. 

The flag also has two rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12. 

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36. 

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40. 

Since each 5-star row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5 stars is 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many trucks are needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones and divide it by the weight capacity of each truck.

First, let's calculate the total weight of the flagstones:
80 flagstones * 75 pounds per flagstone = 6000 pounds

Now, let's divide the total weight by the weight capacity of each truck:
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds per truck = 3

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the time taken by the car in the fast lane, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. 

Given that the car in the fast lane traveled 480 miles at 60 miles/hour, we can calculate its time as follows:
Time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours.

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, its speed is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the same formula to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane:
Time = Distance / Speed = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ali has 22 medals.
2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
4. Together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, which means they have 1/10 of the total medals given out.

Let's represent the total medals given out as 'x'. Then, 1/10 of x is equal to 39. 

To find x, we multiply both sides by 10:
x = 39 * 10
x = 390

The final answer is: 390"
"To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. 

There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, each containing 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

4 adults will get 6 chocolate bars each, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

The remaining chocolate bars are 40 - 24 = 16.

There are 8 children, and they will share the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally. To find out how many each child will get, we divide 16 by 8.

16 / 8 = 2

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find out how many hours she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert her working hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works in 150 minutes:

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed, we need to first calculate their points after the fourth round.

Initially, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's calculate the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed:
Mike has 22 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83

The final answer is: 83"
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we first need to determine how many oranges the sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, and he washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 8 oranges. 

The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges, and the sons washed 12 oranges. To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges: 15 - 12 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total count of activities, we need to calculate the number of each activity done on the first and second day and then add them together.

Day 1:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Day 2:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add the activities from both days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Total count of activities: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

The final answer is: 370"
"To find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day. 

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 3 meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 3 = 0.6 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.6 kg * 5 = 3 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per day (3 kg).

42 kg / 3 kg per day = 14 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide 14 days by 7 to find out how many weeks the rice will last:

14 days / 7 days per week = 2 weeks

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 2 weeks. 

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he sold bread for 5 days. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. 

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates

Since he was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 working days. His target for the week was 120 crates, but he had 2 less working days. 

To find the target for 5 working days, we need to calculate the target per day and then multiply it by 5. 

Target per day = 120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately)

Target for 5 working days = 17.14 * 5 = 85.7 (approximately)

However, since we can't sell a fraction of a crate, we will consider the target for 5 working days as 85 crates.

Now, let's find out how many crates Sam was off from his target for the week. 

Crates off target = Target for 5 working days - Total crates sold
= 85 - 65
= 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to determine the number of bids made by Carmen and the total amount she paid. 

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so there are 3 other people who bid before her. Since she bids after each of them, she makes 3 bids. 

The first bid is $200, and each subsequent bid is $50 more than the previous one. 

The bids made by the other 3 people are $200, $250, and $300. 

Carmen's bids are $250, $300, and $350. 

The total amount she paid is the sum of these bids: $250 + $300 + $350 = $900.

The final answer is: $900"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total miles driven, the total cost of driving, and the total bonus given.

1. Total miles driven: Since John goes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 = 60 miles. 
   He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven per year is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

2. Total cost of driving: He gets charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of driving per year is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

3. Total bonus given: He gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus given per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

4. Total cost: The total cost is the sum of the total cost of driving and the total bonus given, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final answer is: $31,800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of pages and how they are arranged in the tabloid. 

In a standard tabloid, the pages are arranged in a way that the first page is on the left back, the second page is on the left front, the 32nd page is on the right back, and the 31st page is on the right front. 

Since the pages are folded in half, we can consider the left and right sides as separate entities. 

The left side has 16 pages (1-16), and the right side has 16 pages (17-32). 

However, when folded, the left and right sides are combined, so we need to count the number of pages that are visible on the outside of the fold. 

The left side has 8 visible pages (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16), and the right side has 8 visible pages (17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32). 

However, the pages 9-16 on the left side and 17-24 on the right side are actually the back of the pages 8-1 on the left and 16-3 on the right, respectively. 

So, the actual number of visible pages is 8 (left front) + 8 (right front) + 8 (left back) + 8 (right back) = 32. 

However, this counts the back and front of the same page twice. 

So, we need to subtract 16 (the number of pages that are counted twice) from the total. 

32 - 16 = 16 

However, this is the number of visible pages, not the number of pieces of paper. 

Since each piece of paper has two sides, we need to divide the number of visible pages by 2. 

16 / 2 = 8

She also spent an additional $10 on rides.

So, the total amount she spent is $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35.

Now, let's subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount: $50 (initial amount) - $35 (total spent) = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Total books = 250
2. Unsold books = 50
3. Books sold this year = 45
4. Books sold in the first year = 2 * Books sold this year = 2 * 45 = 90
5. Books sold in the second year = Total books - (Unsold books + Books sold this year + Books sold in the first year) 
   = 250 - (50 + 45 + 90)
   = 250 - 185
   = 65

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
Total money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book
= 65 * 20
= 1300

The final answer is: $1300"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Since Watson gets a $300 bonus each week, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for April, which has 4 weeks:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April."
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to calculate 20% of 20, since he beat 80% of the people he arm wrestled.

20% of 20 is calculated as 0.2 * 20 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we first need to determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

So, the number of loaves left after the morning sales is 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. Half of 20 is calculated as (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses per week and then multiply that by the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks:

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we multiply the weight Joey loses per week by 4:

2 pounds per week * 4 weeks = 8 pounds

However, this is the amount of weight Sandy loses in 4 weeks, not the number of weeks it takes her to lose that weight. Since Sandy loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, and we know that Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can conclude that it takes Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. The discounted price is 2 x $11 = $22. The savings on the tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. The discounted price is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2. The savings on the packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new arms and legs grown by Helena's serum.

Every 3 days, a new arm is grown. In 15 days, there will be 15 / 3 = 5 new arms.

Every 5 days, a new leg is grown. In 15 days, there will be 15 / 5 = 3 new legs.

So, in total, Helena's serum will cause a person to grow 5 new arms and 3 new legs.

Total new limbs = 5 (arms) + 3 (legs) = 8

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each, so the total cost of the suits is 6 x $100 = $600.

2. He buys 3 suitcases at $50 each, so the total cost of the suitcases is 3 x $50 = $150.

3. The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. The cost of a business suit is $100, so 5 times that is 5 x $100 = $500. The cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200.

4. The total amount spent so far is $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

5. Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so he has $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left to spend.

6. Since he has spent $1950 so far, he has $4000 - $1950 = $2050 left to spend on gifts for his business partners.

The final answer is: $2050"
"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we first need to find the total number of eggs consumed in a day. 

There are 3 people who eat 3 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs they consume is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs. 

There are 2 people who eat 2 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs they consume is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs consumed in a day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find Trent's age, we need to first find Jane's age. Since Quinn is 30 and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, Jane's age is 30 - 3 = 27.

Now that we know Jane's age, we can find Trent's age. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent's age is 27 + 5 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
2. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
3. The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60000.
4. Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population of Chile is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Total number of players = 105
2. Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D.
3. The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so it's 2D.
4. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it's D/2.
5. The sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams equals the total number of players: 2D + D + D/2 = 105

To solve for D, we need to combine like terms and isolate D:

2D + D + D/2 = 105
Combine like terms: 2.5D = 105
Divide both sides by 2.5: D = 105 / 2.5
D = 42

The number of players on the defense is 42."
"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

For the 2 families with 6 people: 2 * 6 = 12 people
For the 3 families with 4 people: 3 * 4 = 12 people
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24 people

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness, and 1/4 of that number had previous commitments. 
1/4 of 8 is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is 8 (due to illness) + 2 (previous commitments) = 10 people.

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited: 24 - 10 = 14 people.

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156.

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Cost = Volume * cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * 0.1
Cost = 12

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls, nongendered children, and then add them to the number of boys.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls is:
Girls = 3 * Boys = 3 * 30 = 90

Given that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, the number of nongendered children is:
Nongendered children = 1/10 * Boys = 1/10 * 30 = 3

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

1 (electric pole) : 3 (electric wires) = x (electric poles) : 45 (electric wires)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

1 * 45 = 3x
45 = 3x

Now, divide both sides by 3 to find x:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of people who left the party. We know that 1/4 of the total number of people left, and 22 men stayed. 

Let's denote the total number of people as 'x'. Since 1/4 of the people left, 3/4 of the people stayed. We can set up the equation:

3/4 * x = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

We know that the total number of people at the beginning was 25 men + 15 women = 40 people. 

So, we can set up the equation:

3/4 * 40 = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

First, let's calculate 3/4 * 40:
3/4 * 40 = 30

Now, we can rewrite the equation:

30 = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

To find the number of women who stayed, we need to subtract 22 from both sides of the equation:

30 - 22 = number of women who stayed
8 = number of women who stayed

Since there were 15 women at the beginning, we can find the number of women who left by subtracting the number of women who stayed from the initial number of women:

15 - 8 = 7

So, 7 women left the party.

The total number of people who left the party is 1/4 of the total number of people. We can find the total number of people who left by multiplying the total number of people by 1/4:

1/4 * 40 = 10

Since 22 men stayed, the number of men who left is the difference between the initial number of men and the number of men who stayed:

25 - 22 = 3

Now, we can find the number of women who left by subtracting the number of men who left from the total number of people who left:

10 - 3 = 7

We already know that 7 women left the party.

The number of women who stayed is 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first find the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pencils Jam has, we know she has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. Since we know the number of loose pencils, we can subtract 2 from 26 to find the number of pencils in the boxes. 

26 - 2 = 24

Since each box contains an equal number of pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils in the boxes by the number of boxes to find the number of pencils per box.

24 / 3 = 8

Now, we know Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each and Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of boxes needed, we need to add the number of pencils Meg has to the total number of pencils in Jam's boxes and then divide by the number of pencils per box.

Total pencils = 24 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 70
Total boxes = 70 / 8 = 8.75

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and weakens it by 12 milliliters. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we need to find out how many ice cubes are required to achieve this. 

Let's assume the initial temperature of the coffee is 100 degrees (for simplicity). To cool it down to 35 degrees (100 - 65 = 35), we need to use ice cubes that cool the coffee by 13 degrees each. 

Number of ice cubes = (100 - 35) / 13 = 65 / 13 = 5

Each ice cube weakens the coffee by 12 milliliters, so 5 ice cubes will weaken it by 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters.

Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which weakens the coffee further. 

Total weakening effect = 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio of old records to new records. The given ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. 

Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of new records as 7. However, we need to find out how many times the ratio of 2 old records to 1 new record is used to get 7 new records. 

To do this, we can divide the total number of new records (7) by the ratio of new records (1). This gives us 7 / 1 = 7. 

Now, we multiply the result by the ratio of old records (2) to find the total number of old records. This gives us 7 * 2 = 14.

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 14 old records.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of junior programmers:
Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * Total number of employees
= 2/5 * 100
= 40

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is:
Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, let's find the total amount paid to junior programmers:
Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Now, let's find the salary of senior programmers:
Salary of senior programmers = Salary of junior programmers + $400
= $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, let's find the total amount paid to senior programmers:
Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

Now, let's find the total amount paid to all programmers:
Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $208000

The final answer is: $208000"

3. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
4. He eats 3 more lollipops that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
5. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first find out how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can find the time it takes to charge 40% by multiplying 40 by 3. 

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip, apply the rewards and the coupon to the current shopping trip, and then subtract the total from the amount spent on the current shopping trip.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip, so they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. Since they had 4 rewards, they used $4 off their purchase. 

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8. 

So, the total discount is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

To find out how much the customer paid, we subtract the total discount from the amount spent on the current shopping trip: $43 - $12 = $31.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as 'x'. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is 'x - 10'.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. 

So, we can write the equation: 
x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 
3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 
3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 70

Since the smallest group has 'x - 10' students, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from x:
70 - 10 = 60

"Let's break down the information given:

- Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total.
- He has twice as many chickens as cows.

Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as 2C (since he has twice as many chickens as cows).

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

C + 2C = 60

Combine like terms:

3C = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

C = 20

So, there are 20 cows and 2C = 40 chickens.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs:

- Each cow has 4 legs, so 20 cows have 20 x 4 = 80 legs.
- Each chicken has 2 legs, so 40 chickens have 40 x 2 = 80 legs.

The total number of legs is 80 (from cows) + 80 (from chickens) = 160.

However, when Josh slips, 3 balls are dropped. 2 of them are caught, but 1 is lost. So, we subtract 1 from the total number of balls he had.

7 (initial balls) - 1 (lost ball) = 6

Therefore, Josh starts to juggle with 6 balls on stage."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the animals and the container:

Total weight of animals = weight of pink frog + weight of blue beetle + weight of green toad + weight of yellow snake + weight of red bird
= 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30
= 240 pounds

Adding the weight of the container:
Total weight = Total weight of animals + weight of container
= 240 + 20
= 260 pounds

"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June, we first need to calculate the new daily distance he needs to run. 

The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. 1/5 of 5000 meters is 5000 / 5 = 1000 meters. 

So, the new daily distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since there are 30 days in June, the total distance covered in June is 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

"To find the price of Juice Box B, we need to add 5 dollars to the price of Juice Box A. 
Price of Juice Box A = 4 dollars
Price of Juice Box B = Price of Juice Box A + 5 dollars = 4 + 5 = 9 dollars

To find the price of Juice Box C, we need to add 7 dollars to the price of Juice Box A.
Price of Juice Box C = Price of Juice Box A + 7 dollars = 4 + 7 = 11 dollars

Now, we need to find the difference between the price of Juice Box C and Juice Box B.
Difference = Price of Juice Box C - Price of Juice Box B = 11 - 9 = 2 dollars

"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband, and then subtract that from the total number of cookies in a bag.

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 cookies per week.

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies per week.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies per week.

Since there are 36 cookies in a bag, and 27 are consumed by her son and husband, Jenny eats the remaining cookies. 

36 (total cookies) - 27 (cookies eaten by son and husband) = 9 cookies.

The final answer is: 9"

The original price of 2 shirts is 2 * $30 = $60. 
The discount is 40% of $60, which is 0.4 * $60 = $24. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the final cost: $60 - $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the percentage increase, we need to first find the difference in daily earnings and then divide it by the original daily earnings, and finally multiply by 100.

Original daily earnings = 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000
New daily earnings = 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100

Difference in daily earnings = New daily earnings - Original daily earnings = $1100 - $1000 = $100

Percentage increase = (Difference in daily earnings / Original daily earnings) * 100
= ($100 / $1000) * 100
= 0.1 * 100
= 10%

"To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the total monthly expenses and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year).

First, let's calculate the monthly expenses:

- Food: $25 per week * 4 weeks per month = $100 per month
- Treats: $20 per month (no change)
- Medicine: $100 per month (no change)

Total monthly expenses = $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220 per month

Now, let's multiply the total monthly expenses by 12 to find the total yearly expenses:

$220 per month * 12 months per year = $2640 per year

1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To find out how many plant pots April needs in total, we need to calculate the number of pots needed for the roses. Since she needs twice as many pots for the roses as for the daisies, and she needs 30 pots for the daisies, she needs 2 * 30 = 60 pots for the roses.

The total number of pots needed is 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 pots.

Since April had already bought 100 plant pots, we need to subtract the total number of pots needed from the number she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

So, April has 10 plant pots left over. 

The final answer is: 10"

"To find the total time John spent, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them up.

Time spent boating: 6 hours
Time spent swimming: 6 / 2 = 3 hours
Time spent watching shows: 3 shows * 2 hours per show = 6 hours

Total time spent on these activities: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours

Since the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time, we can set up an equation to find the total time:
30% of total time = 6 hours
0.30 * total time = 6 hours
Total time = 6 / 0.30
Total time = 20 hours

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time:
Time spent sightseeing = 40% of 20 hours

"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has in her savings.

From her first job, she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours of work, so her earnings from the first job are:
$10/hour * 20 hours = $200

From her second job, she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours of work, so her earnings from the second job are:
$5/hour * 15 hours = $75

Her total earnings from both jobs are:
$200 + $75 = $275

Now, we subtract the amount she already has in her savings from her total earnings:
$275 - $80 = $195

Annabelle still needs to save $195 to buy the phone."
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the combined height of the two shorter trees. 

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. 
The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

The combined height of the two shorter trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two shorter trees combined, so it is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is 34 feet.

"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money he spent and then subtract that from the initial amount he received.

First, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on toy cars: 6 toy cars * $2 per toy car = $12.

Next, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on teddy bears: 5 teddy bears * $1 per teddy bear = $5.

Now, let's add the total amount spent on toy cars and teddy bears: $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially received $28 from his mother. He spent $17, so we subtract the amount spent from the initial amount: $28 - $17 = $11.

After his mother gave him an extra $10, we add this to the amount he had left: $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
Since there are 'x' friends, the total cost for mini-golf for all of them is 1 + x * $5. 

The cost of arcade tokens for all of them is $5. 

The cost of go-karts for all of them is 2 * $10 * (1 + x), since Morgan and her 'x' friends will ride the go-karts twice.

The total cost is the sum of the costs of mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts: 
Total cost = (1 + x) * $5 + $5 + 2 * $10 * (1 + x)
Total cost = $5 + $5x + $5 + $20 + $20x
Total cost = $30 + $25x

Since Morgan's dad has a budget of $90, we can set up the equation:
$30 + $25x = $90

Now, we can solve for 'x' by subtracting $30 from both sides of the equation:
$25x = $60

Now, we divide both sides of the equation by $25 to find the value of 'x':
x = $60 / $25
x = 2.4

Since we can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
x = 2

Marisa's daily allowance is $5. 
She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total cost of lollipops per day is 4 * 0.25 = $1. 

Now, let's subtract the cost of lollipops from her daily allowance: $5 - $1 = $4. 

Since she saves this amount for 5 days, we multiply the daily savings by 5: $4 * 5 = $20.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Billy starts with $10.
2. He buys candy, and we need to find out how many pounds he bought. Let's call the number of pounds 'x'. The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound, so the total cost of the candy is 1.5x.
3. After buying the candy, Billy has $10 - 1.5x left.
4. He then takes half of this amount and spends it on gumballs. Half of $10 - 1.5x is (10 - 1.5x)/2.
5. The cost of each gumball is $0.05, and he bought 40 gumballs, so the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.
6. The equation becomes: (10 - 1.5x)/2 = 2
7. Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 10 - 1.5x = 4
8. Subtract 10 from both sides: -1.5x = -6
9. Divide both sides by -1.5: x = 4

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. First, add 5 to both sides:

45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5
50 = 2x

Next, divide both sides by 2:

50 / 2 = 2x / 2
25 = x

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the three cities. 

Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
Distance from the third city to the first city: 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs)
Total distance in one trip: 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is:
225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles/day

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the distance it travels in a day (675 miles):
18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days

So, the train goes approximately 26.67 days between services."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds, we need to find the average of the stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds. 

The average is calculated by adding the two values and dividing by 2. 

Average stuffing for collie beds = (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua and collie beds. 

For 4 chihuahua beds: 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.
For 3 collie beds: 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Total amount of stuffing needed = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and add them together.

First, let's calculate the time taken for the trip to his friend's house:
Distance = 200 miles
Speed = 70 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours (approximately)

However, he took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the actual distance traveled to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles.
Time taken for the detour part = 10 / 70 = 0.14 hours (approximately)
Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 2.86 + 0.14 = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the time taken for the trip back home:
Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to reach his friend's house + Time taken to come back home
Total time taken = 3 + 3 = 6 hours

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S. 
   We can write the equation: S = 4 * 3 - 5
   S = 12 - 5
   S = 7
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V. 
   We can write the equation: V = 3 * S
   V = 3 * 7
   V = 21
4. If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, we can write the equation: 
   Total = 3 (refusing to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) + X (other reasons)

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2 to isolate x:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of female members in the choir, we first need to find 50% of 52, which is 26. 

Since half the people performing can't make it to the show, we need to find 50% of 26, which is 13. This means 13 people can't make it to the show. 

So, the number of people who can make it to the show is 26 - 13 = 13. 

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so the total number of people who sang in the performance is 13 + 3 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of the 5 test scores. 

First, we add up the scores: 
65 + 94 = 159
159 + 81 = 240
240 + 86 = 326
326 + 74 = 400

Next, we divide the sum by the number of scores to find the average:
400 / 5 = 80

So, Wilson's current math grade is 80. 

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 6 erasers is 6 x $2 = $12.

Now, we add the cost of erasers and pencils together: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu.

First, let's find the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and the number of messages to Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

The final answer is: 88"
"To find out how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of the rides for Dasha and compare it to the cost of the ride bracelet for David.

Dasha buys tickets for 9 rides at $2 per ticket. Since each ride costs 2 tickets, she needs 9 * 2 = 18 tickets. The cost of the tickets is 18 * $2 = $36.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.

The total cost for Dasha is $36, and the total cost for David is $30. 

The difference in cost is $36 - $30 = $6.

David saves $6 by buying a ride bracelet instead of tickets."
"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to first determine the total number of gifts she has to wrap. 

Monica has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. 

Total gifts = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts

Since she wants to make a bow for each gift, she will need to make 12 bows. 

She has 144 inches of ribbon in total. 

To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon by the number of bows. 

Ribbon per bow = Total ribbon / Total bows
Ribbon per bow = 144 / 12
Ribbon per bow = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the number of popsicles each person has, we need to divide the total number of popsicles by the sum of the ratio parts (5+6=11) and then multiply by the respective ratio parts.

Let's calculate the number of popsicles each person has:

Total popsicles = 165
Ratio sum = 5 + 6 = 11

Number of popsicles Betty has = (5/11) * 165 = 75
Number of popsicles Sam has = (6/11) * 165 = 90

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. 

The normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $20. However, Tim saves 20% by bundling, so we need to calculate the discount. 

20% of $20 is 0.2 x $20 = $4. 

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16. 

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26. 

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, he saves $60 - $26 = $34 by cancelling his cable subscription. 

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total time spent on the song, we need to add up the time spent writing, recording, and editing. 

Time spent writing: 4 hours
Time spent recording: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
Time spent editing: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours

Total time spent = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours

Now, to find the percentage of time spent editing, we need to divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100.

Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of books Wendy wants to place, we first need to determine the number of books in the shelving system. Since it has 6 rows and 6 columns, we multiply the number of rows by the number of columns to get the total number of spaces for books.

6 rows * 6 columns = 36 spaces

Now, we need to double this number and add 20. 

Double the number of spaces: 36 * 2 = 72
Add 20 to the doubled number: 72 + 20 = 92

Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

The final answer is: 92"
"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, received, and then subtract the number of cards she passed out.

Initially, Erica made 20 Valentine's cards.

Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each, so she received 2 * 15 = 30 cards.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

She received 17 cards from family and friends.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has:

Initial cards + cards received - cards given away = total cards
20 + 30 - 29 = 21

However, Erica also received 17 cards, so we need to add those to the total:
21 + 17 = 38

Therefore, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards."
"To find out how many slices Jenny gave to Bill and Mark, we need to calculate 1/3 and 1/4 of the total slices.

1/3 of 12 slices is 12 * (1/3) = 4 slices.
1/4 of 12 slices is 12 * (1/4) = 3 slices.

So, Bill got 4 slices and Mark got 3 slices. Jenny gave away a total of 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so the total slices left are 12 - 7 - 2 = 3 slices.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many days Mark needs to save his money, we need to divide the cost of the bike by the amount he earns per day.

Cost of the bike: $300
Daily earnings: $10

"To find out how much the builder earns in a year, we need to calculate his daily earnings, then multiply it by the number of days he works in a year.

First, let's find out how much he earns in a day: $50 per day.

Since he works 6 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, he works 6 * 4 = 24 days in a month.

There are 12 months in a year, so he works 24 * 12 = 288 days in a year.

Now, let's multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he works in a year: $50 * 288 = $14,400.

The final answer is: $14,400"
"To find out how many bags of flour Mark needs to buy, we need to divide the total amount of flour required by the amount of flour in each bag. 

Total flour required = 4 * 3 cups = 12 cups
Flour in each bag = 2 cups
Number of bags of flour = 12 cups / 2 cups/bag = 6 bags

To find out how many bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we need to divide the total amount of milk required by the amount of milk in each bottle.

Total milk required = 4 * 1 cup = 4 cups
Milk in each bottle = 2 cups
Number of bottles of milk = 4 cups / 2 cups/bottle = 2 bottles

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we need to subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour.

Number of bags of flour - Number of bottles of milk = 6 bags - 2 bottles = 4

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the energy used per day and then the energy saved per day. 

The energy used per hour is 900 watts. Since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts, the energy used per hour is 0.9 kilowatts. 

The energy used per day is 0.9 kilowatts * 8 hours = 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh).

If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new energy used per day is 0.9 kilowatts * 3 hours = 2.7 kWh.

The energy saved per day is 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh.

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30: 4.5 kWh * 30 = 135 kWh.

"To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required and then multiply it by their respective costs.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we need to find out how many sandwiches are required to serve 20 people.

Number of people = 20
Number of people per sandwich = 4
Number of sandwiches required = 20 / 4 = 5

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, the total amount of meat and cheese required is also 5 pounds each.

Cost of meat per pound = $7.00
Cost of cheese per pound = $3.00
Total amount of meat required = 5 pounds
Total amount of cheese required = 5 pounds

Total cost of meat = 5 pounds * $7.00/pound = $35.00
Total cost of cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00/pound = $15.00

Total cost = Total cost of meat + Total cost of cheese = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Allan initially has 40 cannolis.
2. He bought 60 more cannolis, so now he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.
3. He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.
4. Initially, he had twice as much corn as cannolis, so he had 2 * 40 = 80 corns.
5. Now, he has 80 + 60 = 140 corns.
6. The total number of corns and cannolis is 140 + 100 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first determine how many steps he had completed before his jog. 

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps he completed before his jog would be 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. 

10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps completed before jog) = 4,000 steps left
4,000 (steps left) - 2,000 (remaining steps) = 2,000 steps taken during the jog

"To find out how many minutes Toby will be early, we need to calculate the total time it takes for him to read the book and travel to the airport, and then subtract that from the time he has available.

First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:
45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Toby to read the book:
9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to get to the airport:
30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes

Since Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave, we subtract the total time from the available time:
60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. So, the company had 40 - 10 = 30 employees in June. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

The final answer is: $168,000"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds and the first pound is full price, the second pound is half off. The cost of the first pound is $3, and the cost of the second pound is $3 / 2 = $1.50. So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. She bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount spent by Tim, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework separately and then add them together.

The first package of fireworks costs $400. The second package costs twice that much, which is 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost of the fireworks by 0.20 (which is the decimal equivalent of 20%): $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discount amount is subtracted from the total cost of the fireworks: $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150.

The total amount spent by Tim is the sum of the discounted cost of the fireworks and the cost of the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate how many cookies she will eat in 30 days. 

Since Shannon eats 2 cookies a night, and there are 30 days in the period, the total number of cookies she will eat is 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Since each dozen contains 12 cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she will eat by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs. 

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5 dozens.

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two events. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50,000 candles smell like wet dog, so the number of candles that smell like wet dog is 0.05 * 50,000 = 2500.

Next, we need to find the number of candles that are more dangerous and have a 1% chance of exploding. However, the problem states that 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog, and the remaining 95% do not. Since 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog, 95% of the more dangerous candles do not smell like wet dog. 

Let's denote the number of more dangerous candles as x. Then, 0.05x = 2500 (the number of candles that smell like wet dog). Solving for x, we get x = 2500 / 0.05 = 50,000.

Now, we know that 1% of the more dangerous candles explode. So, the number of candles that explode is 0.01 * 50,000 = 500.

However, this is the total number of candles that explode, not the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. Since 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 0.05 * 500 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to find the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount amount is 30% of the regular price, which is 0.3 * $20 = $6. 

So, the discounted price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The average trees are not specified, so let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as 'x'.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 45 + x.
The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can set up the equation: (45 + x) + 105 = 500.

Simplifying the equation: 45 + x + 105 = 500
Combine like terms: 150 + x = 500
Subtract 150 from both sides: x = 350

The final answer is: 350"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

We know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can write the equation:

C + D = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304, and since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can write the equation:

2C + D = 304

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve for C and D by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know C, we can substitute this value into the first equation to solve for D:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the information given.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 4 * 200 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers. So, the total distance covered in the next two days is 240 kilometers.

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance covered is 0 kilometers.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 7 * 300 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, let's add up the distances covered in each period: 
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next two days: 240 kilometers
- Next day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance = 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from Peter's locker size. 

Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can find Zack's locker size by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4. 

Zack's locker size = 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches.

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can find Timothy's locker size by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 20 * 2 = 40 cubic inches.

The first bank gave him $4000. 
The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so the second bank gave him 2 * $4000 = $8000.

Now, let's add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital: 
$4000 (from the first bank) + $8000 (from the second bank) = $12000
$12000 + $5000 (initial capital) = $17000

1. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20.
3. Now, the number of cats left on the rock is 50 - 20 = 30.
4. 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran, we multiply 3/5 by 30: (3/5) * 30 = 18.
5. The number of cats left on the rock is the remaining cats minus the cats that ran after the mouse: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different periods and calculate the cost for each period.

1. The first 6 months cost $8 per month, so the total cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.
2. The next 8 months cost $12 per month, so the total cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.
3. The remaining months in 2 years (24 months) minus the first 14 months (6 + 8) is 24 - 14 = 10 months. The cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, we add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the cost of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, we can write an equation:

x = 28 - 6
x = 22

So, the jogger jeans cost $22.

The total savings is $6, and Cole saved 1/3 of this amount from the jogger jeans. 

1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans is (1/3) * 6 = 2.

This means he saved $2 from the jogger jeans. 

Since he saved $6 in total and $2 from the jogger jeans, he saved $6 - $2 = $4 from the tattered jeans.

The cost of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 from it. 

The amount he saved from the tattered jeans is 4/28 = 1/7 of the cost of the tattered jeans.

Since 1/7 of the cost of the tattered jeans is $4, the total cost of the tattered jeans is 7 * 4 = 28.

However, we already know that the tattered jeans cost $28, so this confirms our initial information.

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. 

The jogger jeans cost $22, and the tattered jeans cost $28. 

The difference between the cost of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is 28 - 22 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

The capacity of the 4 buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
The capacity of the 6 minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
The capacity of the 10 minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The final answer is: 570"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, so she has a total of 6 bird feeders.

Let's denote the number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders as x. Since the feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds each, the number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders is x + 10.

Since there are 3 store-bought feeders and 3 homemade feeders, the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is 3x, and the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10).

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is the sum of the birds attracted by the store-bought feeders and the homemade feeders, which is 3x + 3(x + 10).

Since each bird feeder attracts 20 birds, the total number of birds attracted by all 6 feeders is 6 * 20 = 120.

We can set up the equation: 3x + 3(x + 10) = 120

Combine like terms: 3x + 3x + 30 = 120

Combine the x terms: 6x + 30 = 120

Subtract 30 from both sides: 6x = 90

Divide both sides by 6: x = 15

Now that we know x, we can find the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders: 3(x + 10) = 3(15 + 10) = 3 * 25 = 75

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is the sum of the birds attracted by the store-bought feeders and the homemade feeders: 3x + 3(x + 10) = 3(15) + 3(25) = 45 + 75 = 120

However, this is the total number of birds attracted by all 6 feeders, and we know that each feeder attracts 20 birds. So, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 6 * 20 = 120.

However, the question states that the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so the store-bought feeders attract 20 - 10 = 10 birds each. The homemade feeders attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

The total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is 3 * 10 = 30, and the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 30 + 90 = 120.

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.25: $4 * 0.25 = $1. Then, we add this to the cost of the bagel: $4 + $1 = $5. So, the soup costs $5.

The cake is half the price of the bagel. To find half of $4, we divide $4 by 2: $4 / 2 = $2. So, the cake costs $2.

Now, we add the costs of the bagel, soup, and cake together: $4 + $5 + $2 = $11.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how many cards he sold. Since he has $50 in spending cash and the ticket costs $100, he must have sold cards worth $50 to get the remaining $50. 

Since each card is sold for $1.5, the number of cards he sold is $50 / $1.5 = 33.33. However, since you can't sell a fraction of a card, we'll round down to 33 cards.

Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he kept is 1/3 * x, where x is the total number of cards he started with. The number of cards he sold is x - (1/3 * x) = 2/3 * x. We know that 2/3 * x = 33.

To find x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2 to get x = 33 * (3/2) = 49.5. However, since you can't have a fraction of a card, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, but in this case, we will round down to 49 because we know he sold 33 cards and he kept 1/3 of the cards, so the total number of cards he had to sell and keep is 49.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. Since there are 36 guests, half of them is 36 / 2 = 18. So, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 18 guests to have two hotdogs.

2. This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs for the 18 guests who would have two hotdogs.

3. Since the caterer prepared 36 hotdogs for 18 guests, and each guest gets one hotdog initially, the total number of hotdogs prepared is 36.

4. However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means 40 guests are now trying to get a second hotdog, but there are only 36 hotdogs prepared.

5. Since there are 36 hotdogs and 40 guests want a second hotdog, 4 guests will not get a second hotdog because there are not enough hotdogs for everyone to have a second one.

2. Apply the 20% discount:
- Discount amount = 20% of $165.00 = 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00
- Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount amount = $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George had initially. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, he must have had $100 initially (since 1% of $100 is $1, and he spent $5).

Now, let's find out how much he spent on chips. Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, and he bought 3 bags. So, the total cost of chips is 3 * 0.40 = $1.20.

Since he spent $5 in total, and $1.20 was spent on chips, the amount spent on candy bars is $5 - $1.20 = $3.60.

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is $3.60 / 0.75 = 4.8.

Since you can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 4 candy bars for $3, and the remaining $0.60 will be enough to buy 0.8 candy bars, which is equivalent to 1 candy bar (since 0.8 * 0.75 = 0.6, and 0.6 + 1 = 1.6, and 1.6 - 1 = 0.6, and 0.6 / 0.75 = 0.8).

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. Since the area of the room is given as 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length to feet first. 

1 yard = 3 feet
So, 3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:
Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula:
Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads for Margareth = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Difference in beads = Total beads for Margareth - Total beads for Elizabeth
= 140 - 60
= 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven:

The oven is on for 3 hours, and it raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase is:
3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window:

The window is open for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes, so for 30 minutes, it cools down:
(30 minutes / 10 minutes) * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

Now, let's calculate the final temperature of the house:
Initial temperature = 40 degrees
Temperature increase due to oven = 15 degrees
Temperature decrease due to window = 6 degrees
Final temperature = Initial temperature + Temperature increase - Temperature decrease
= 40 + 15 - 6
= 49 degrees

The final answer is: 49"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took James to complete the swim and bike ride. 

The time it took Jon to complete the swim is 40 minutes. James finishes the swim 10% faster, so we need to find 10% of 40 minutes and subtract it from 40 minutes. 

10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. So, James finishes the swim in 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

The time it took Jon to complete the bike ride is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. James takes 5 minutes longer, so he takes 80 + 5 = 85 minutes to complete the bike ride.

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. This means that the total time it took James to complete the triathlon is 10 minutes more than the total time it took Jon. 

The total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes. 

The total time it took James to complete the triathlon is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

We know that James took 36 minutes to complete the swim and 85 minutes to complete the bike ride. To find the time it took James to complete the run, we need to subtract the time it took him to complete the swim and bike ride from the total time it took him to complete the triathlon.

Time taken by James to complete the run = Total time taken by James - (Time taken by James to complete the swim + Time taken by James to complete the bike ride)
= 180 - (36 + 85)
= 180 - 121
= 59 minutes

The final answer is: 59"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then divide it by 4.

Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so it is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so it is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to calculate the distance it runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, we need to convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 

Distance = Speed * Time = 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to calculate the number of eggs in the dozen cases and add the loose eggs. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so to find out how many glasses Rozanne can make, we divide the total number of eggs by 5. 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to first calculate the total revenue from the sale of sneakers.

The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each on Monday, so the revenue from Monday's sale is:
17 * $20 = $340

The remaining sneakers are 48 - 17 = 31. These were sold for $25 each throughout the rest of the week. The revenue from the sale of these sneakers is:
31 * $25 = $775

The total revenue from the sale of all sneakers is:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The cost of the case of 48 sneakers is $576. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The salesman's profit is $539."
"To find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each and the four packets with 16 pieces each.

For the six packets with 8 pieces each: 6 * 8 = 48

Now, we add the total number of crayons from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112

The final answer is: 112"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra.
2. The regular price of a soda is $3.
3. You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of the popcorn and soda together must be $2 more than the cost of the super ticket. 

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and the extra cost of the popcorn and soda is $1. So, the total cost of the popcorn and soda is $20 + $2 = $22.

Since the soda costs $3, the cost of the popcorn is $22 - $3 = $19.

The regular price of popcorn is $19.

The final answer is: $19"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is:

New cost = Original cost + Increase
New cost = 45 + 20
New cost = 65

Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new cost. 

Total cost = New cost * Number of balloons
Total cost = 65 * 170
Total cost = 11050

The final answer is: 11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed x Time
For the first part of the trip: Distance = 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles
For the second part of the trip: Distance = 30 mph x 1 hour = 30 miles
Total distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average speed = 50 mph

"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies separately and then add them together.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires is:
8 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $6400

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she now has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left. The value of the sapphires remains the same, $6400.

The value of the 2 rubies she received in the trade is:
2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400

Now, we add the value of the sapphires and rubies together:
$6400 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $8800

The total value of Jenna's jewels is $8800.

The final answer is: $8800"
"To find the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. So together, they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, we multiply the total number of apples they eat per day by 30:

8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so the total number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost will be 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we first need to determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of red cards = 15
60% of red cards = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24 = 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has and the number of puppies Brandon's dog has. 

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. 
Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. 
Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the weight of each type of feed and add them together.

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Total weight of feed = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips.

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
= 3400 / 2250
= 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda a week. Since an aluminum can is worth 2 cents, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles of water a week. Since a plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

In a four-week month, Grayson's total earnings from aluminum cans are 6 * 4 = 24 cents.

In a four-week month, Grayson's total earnings from plastic bottles are 15 * 4 = 60 cents.

Grayson's total earnings from recycling in a four-week month are 24 + 60 = 84 cents.

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we'll convert the remoras' length from inches to feet. 

1 foot = 12 inches
6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet

There are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. 

Combined length of remoras = 1 foot
Length of shark = 10 feet

Percentage = (Combined length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add than Gabriel, we need to subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add.
80 - 40 = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to first find out how many oranges he ate. 

They picked 60 oranges and Stetson ate 2/5 of them. 

2/5 of 60 = (2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. 

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange he ate, the total amount of money he gave up is:

24 * 10 = 240

The final answer is: $240"
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

Cost of shoes = $80
3 times the cost of shoes = 3 * $80 = $240

Since the handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes, we subtract $20 from $240.

Cost of handbag = 3 times the cost of shoes - $20
= $240 - $20
= $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to first calculate the total miles he runs in a week. 

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so the total miles he runs in a week is 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week.

Since James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed. 

Total hours = Total miles / Speed
Total hours = 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
Total hours = 6 hours/week

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day. 

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day. So, each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

For five days, the total amount of oats consumed is 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, so to find out how many bags Uncle Ben needs, we divide the total amount of oats consumed by the amount in each bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"

"To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and coupon applied.

First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors at the sale price. Since it's buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Now, let's apply the $2.00 coupon to the cost of 1 pack. The new cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since Heather buys 2 packs, but only pays for 1 pack, the total cost is $2.00.

Now, let's find the number of razors in 2 packs. 2 packs * 4 razors per pack = 8 razors.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to divide the total cost by the number of razors. The total cost is $2.00, which is equal to 200 cents. 

The cost of each individual razor is 200 cents / 8 razors = 25 cents.

"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them up.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each, so their total height is 4 * 64 = 256"".

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 3 * 64 = 192"".

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128"".

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 536"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 536"" / 12 = 44.67 feet.

"To find out how many pies they can make, we first need to determine the total number of oranges they have. 

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she has 5 * 10 = 50 oranges. 
Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges. 
In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the total number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

"Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

For the first venue, the total cost is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost). 

For the second venue, the total cost is $25x (per person charge).

To find the number of guests where the two venues are equal in cost, we set the two equations equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by Bodhi as B, David as D, and Lily as L. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write an equation: L = D + 7.

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write another equation: D = B/2.

We are also given that together they collected 43 insects, so the sum of the insects found by each of them is 43: L + D + B = 43.

Now we can substitute the first equation into the third equation: (D + 7) + D + B = 43.

Combine like terms: 2D + B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2D + B = 36.

Now substitute the second equation into this one: 2(D) + B = 36, 2(B/2) + B = 36.

Simplify the equation: B + B = 36, 2B = 36.

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18.

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find out how many David found: D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9.

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find out how many Lily found: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.

"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find 1/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 1/4 (which is the same as dividing by 4).

364 / 4 = 91 yards

Mariah used 91 yards of yarn.

Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is the same as 2/4. To find 2/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 2 and then divide by 4.

364 * 2 = 728
728 / 4 = 182 yards

Her grandma used 182 yards of yarn.

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together.

91 + 182 = 273 yards

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar spent. 

Let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

For a 2 x 4 piece of wood, Frederick can get 200 sticks for $4. 
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

For a 2 x 8 piece of wood, Frederick can get 400 sticks for $6. 
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar spent, we will use this type of wood.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24:

Number of 2 x 8 pieces of wood = $24 / $6 = 4

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives him 400 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make is:

Total sticks = 4 * 400 = 1600

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cows and sheep at the farm and the zoo, and then add them together.

The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, and the zoo has 20 sheep, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

The total number of cows at the farm and the zoo is 30 + 60 = 90 cows.

The total number of sheep at the farm and the zoo is 10 + 20 = 30 sheep.

The total number of animals at the farm and the zoo is 90 + 30 = 120.

"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to first determine the total number of items Rose bought. Since Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, the total number of items she bought is 12 + 4 = 16.

We are told that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. Let's represent the number of items Sophia bought as 'x'. Then, the number of items Rose bought is 4x. Since we know Rose bought 16 items, we can set up the equation 4x = 16.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 16 / 4 = 4.

Since x represents the number of items Sophia bought, and we know that Sophia bought a combination of onions and potatoes, we can assume that the ratio of onions to potatoes is the same as Rose's, which is 12:4 or 3:1. Therefore, Sophia bought 3/4 of the total items she bought, which is 3/4 * 4 = 3 onions and 1/4 * 4 = 1 potato.

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 3 + 1 = 4."
"To find the total number of days Andy has to lose the weight, we need to subtract his birthday from the current date. 

December 31st to July 19th is approximately 6 months and 19 days. 

There are 30 days in a month, so 6 months is 6 * 30 = 180 days. 
Adding the remaining 19 days, we get 180 + 19 = 199 days.

Since Andy wants to lose 30 lbs, and he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, he needs to burn a total of 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 105,000 / 199 ≈ 527 calories.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can set up the equation: x + 3x = 120,000.

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000.

Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x = 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to first determine how many cups of raisins she has available for the oatmeal cookies. 

Since she divides the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each of these will get 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

However, the oatmeal cookies require 3/4 of a cup of raisins per batch. To find out how many batches she can make, we need to divide the total raisins available for oatmeal cookies by the amount needed per batch.

First, let's find out how many cups of raisins are available for oatmeal cookies: 9 cups (for oatmeal cookies) - 3/4 cup (for oatmeal cookies) = 9 - 0.75 = 8.25 cups. However, this is incorrect as we are subtracting from the total raisins available for oatmeal cookies, not the total raisins in the bag. 

The correct way to find the available raisins for oatmeal cookies is to first find out how many cups of raisins are left after the granola and snack mix are made. Since each of these also gets 9 cups of raisins, the total raisins used for granola and snack mix is 9 + 9 = 18 cups. 

Now, subtract the total raisins used for granola and snack mix from the total raisins in the bag: 27 - 18 = 9 cups of raisins available for oatmeal cookies.

Now, we can divide the available raisins for oatmeal cookies by the amount needed per batch: 9 / 0.75 = 12.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device, then multiply it by the cost per kilowatt hour.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. 

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour.

Since there are 7 days in a week, her weekly consumption before adding the new device is 12 * 7 = 84 kilowatts per hour. 

Her weekly consumption after adding the new device is 14 * 7 = 98 kilowatts per hour.

The cost per kilowatt hour is $1.50. 

So, her weekly bill before adding the new device is 84 * $1.50 = $126.

Her weekly bill after adding the new device is 98 * $1.50 = $147.

The difference in her weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it would take one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it would take them 10 days to paint a whole house (since it would take twice as long to paint the entire house).

Now, we need to find out how many hours it would take for one person to paint a whole house. There are 24 hours in a day, so:

10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours

Since it would take one person 240 hours to paint a whole house, we can now determine how long it would take 5 people to paint a whole house. If one person can paint a whole house in 240 hours, 5 people can paint a whole house in:

240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final answer is: 48"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chairs Ophelia and Jenna have. 

Since Ophelia has 20 sofas and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can set up an equation to find the number of chairs Ophelia has. Let's call the number of chairs Ophelia has 'x'. Then, the number of sofas she has is x - 2. We know that the number of sofas Ophelia has is 20, so we can set up the equation x - 2 = 20.

Solving for x, we get x = 22. This means Ophelia has 22 chairs.

Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Now, we know that Ophelia has 20 sofas and Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have. Total = 20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 64 (Jenna's sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 152.

The final answer is: 152"
"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we first need to determine how many CDs he could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set. 

Let's assume the cost of the headphone set is x. Since Tom paid a total of $48, and the CD costs $4, we can set up the equation: 

4 + x = 48

To find the cost of the headphone set, we subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

x = 48 - 4
x = 44

So, the headphone set costs $44. 

Now, we can find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set:

Number of CDs = Total money spent on headphone set / Cost of one CD
= 44 / 4
= 11

Since Tom bought 1 CD, the number of CDs he could have bought if he had not bought the headphone set is 11 - 1 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours spent in the weeks where he worked out 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours.

In the weeks where he worked out 4 hours, there are 6 weeks (since 8 weeks - 2 weeks = 6 weeks). So, the total hours spent in these weeks is 6 * 4 = 24 hours.

In the weeks where he worked out 5 hours, there are 2 weeks. So, the total hours spent in these weeks is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

In the week where he worked out 6 hours, there is 1 week. So, the total hours spent in this week is 1 * 6 = 6 hours.

Now, we add up the total hours spent in all the weeks: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours.

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is 40 (who were already there) + 40 (who got in) = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is 80 - 21 = 59.

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 21 got off, 3 times fewer would be 21 - (3 * 21) = 21 - 63 = -42. However, since you can't have a negative number of people getting on the bus, this means that no one gets on at the second stop.

So, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 59.

The final answer is: 59"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Let's denote Jame's age in 8 years as J8 and his cousin's age in 8 years as C8. 
   We know that C8 = 2 * J8 - 5.
3. Since Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30, we can substitute J8 = 30 into the equation from step 2.
   C8 = 2 * 30 - 5 = 55.
4. Now we know Jame's cousin's age in 8 years is 55, so his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.
5. To find the difference in their current ages, we subtract Jame's age from his cousin's age: 47 - 22 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to find the cost of the printer. Since the computer cost $1,100 and the printer cost $400 less, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.

Since the total cost of all items is $2,400, the cost of the two monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the monitors by 2: $600 / 2 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we first need to determine the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Since there are 10 boys (half of 20 kids) and each boy brought 60 shells, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + (4 * 600) seashells.

First, we calculate four times the number of shells brought by the boys: 4 * 600 = 2400.

Then, we add the number of shells brought by the boys to this: 600 + 2400 = 3000.

Since there are 10 girls (half of 20 kids), we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by 10 to find out how many seashells each girl brought: 3000 / 10 = 300.

The final answer is: 300"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's assume the number of candies George had initially is 'x'. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2x candies initially.

2. George ate 5 candies, so the number of candies George has left is x - 5.

3. We are given that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 3.

4. To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation: x = 3 + 5, x = 8.

5. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, and George had 8 candies initially, Nick had 2x = 2 * 8 = 16 candies initially.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188

"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made and subtract that from the target of 72.

Emma made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

Total vlogs made = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Since Emma's target is 72 vlogs, we subtract the total vlogs made from the target:

72 - 54 = 18

Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her target of 72 vlogs per month.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total amount you paid, first, calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill. 

20% of $50 is calculated as 0.20 * $50 = $10.

Then, add the tip to the original bill: $50 + $10 = $60.

Since you and your wife are splitting the bill evenly, you will pay half of the total amount: $60 / 2 = $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys. This means each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11.

The following day, he added another $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spent $8, so he has $21 - $8 = $13 left.

After saving some more, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8. This means he now has 3 * $13 = $39.

The final answer is: $39"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of April is x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half of April is 30 - x.

Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. Let's denote the amount he saves in the first half as y. Then, the amount he saves in the second half is 2y.

The total amount Elvis wants to save in April is $1125. So, the sum of the amounts he saves in the first and second half of the month is equal to his target:

xy + 2y = 1125

Since we don't know the value of x, we can express x in terms of the total number of days in April (30). The first half of April has x days, so the second half has 30 - x days. We know that the total number of days in April is 30, so x + (30 - x) = 30. This simplifies to 30 = 30, which is true for any value of x.

However, we can express x in terms of the number of days in the second half of April, which is 30 - x. We can rewrite the equation as:

xy + 2y = 1125

We can factor out y from the left-hand side of the equation:

y(x + 2) = 1125

Now, we need to find the value of y. We know that Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. This means that the amount he saves in the second half (2y) is equal to the amount he saves in the first half (y) plus the additional amount he saves in the second half. Let's call the additional amount he saves in the second half z. Then, 2y = y + z.

We know that the total amount Elvis saves in the second half is 2y, and the total amount he saves in the first half is y. The total amount he saves in April is $1125, so the sum of the amounts he saves in the first and second half of the month is equal to his target:

y + 2y = 1125

Combine like terms:

3y = 1125

Divide both sides by 3:

y = 375

Now that we know the value of y, we can find the value of z. We know that 2y = y + z, so:

2(375) = 375 + z

750 = 375 + z

Subtract 375 from both sides:

375 = z

Now that we know the value of z, we can find the value of x. We know that the amount Elvis saves in the second half is 2y, and the amount he saves in the first half is y. We also know that the total amount he saves in the second half is 2y, and the total amount he saves in the first half is y. The total amount he saves in April is $1125, so the sum of the amounts he saves in the first and second half of the month is equal to his target:

"To find the total cost of the fruits, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of 3 apples at $1.50 each is 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of 5 oranges at $0.80 each is 5 x $0.80 = $4.
The cost of 6 peaches at $0.75 each is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them will get and then find the difference.

Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, and he finished 20 tasks. So, Jairus's total earnings = 0.8 * 20 = $16.

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, and she finished 20 tasks. So, Jenny's total earnings = 0.5 * 20 = $10.

Now, to find the difference, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings: 16 - 10 = 6.

"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as x. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x.

The total amount of money they have is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation: x + 4x = 100.

Combine like terms: 5x = 100.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 20.

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4(20) = 80 dollars.

Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the total miles he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 = 6 miles.

Since he works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice: 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters
2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once: 26 / 2 = 13 letters
3. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written: 52 + 13 = 65 letters

Now, we need to add the total number of letters she wrote in the first two steps: 52 + 13 = 65

However, since she re-wrote everything she had already written, we need to add the total number of letters she wrote in the first two steps again: 65 + 65 = 130

The final answer is: 130"
"This is an example of exponential growth, specifically a geometric progression. 

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 
In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so there are 3 * 3 = 9 new families notified. 
In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so there are 9 * 3 = 27 new families notified. 
In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so there are 27 * 3 = 81 new families notified.

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and then add that to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight he lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Now, we add the weight he lost to his final weight to find his initial weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first determine the total number of toys in the larger play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys and the larger play set is five times larger, we can calculate the total number of toys in the larger play set as follows:

Total toys in larger play set = 5 * 80 = 400

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys to have enough to make this larger play set, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Number of toys Jonathan currently has + 2 = Total toys in larger play set

Let's represent the number of toys Jonathan currently has as 'x'. Then the equation becomes:

x + 2 = 400

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys. 

The final answer is: 398"
"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

Cost of 2 pens: 2 x $0.25 = $0.50
Cost of 1 calculator: $12
Cost of 1 geometry set: $10
Total cost before discount: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

Now, we need to apply the 10% discount to the total cost. 
Discount amount: 10% of $30 = 0.1 x $30 = $3
Total cost after discount: $30 - $3 = $27

The final answer is: $27"

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the sales above $1000.

For the first $1000, she earns a 30% commission:
$1000 * 0.30 = $300

For the sales above $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, she earns an additional 10% commission:
$1500 * 0.10 = $150

"To find out how many bottles Bill needs in total, we first need to calculate the number of bottles he already has. Since he has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, he has 2 x 24 = 48 bottles.

Since he wants 2 bottles for each of the 70 guests, he needs 70 x 2 = 140 bottles in total.

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92.

The final answer is: 92"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. 2 minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

So, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

To find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in warm water, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3. 34 * 3 = 102 minutes.

To find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold water, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3. 16 * 3 = 48 minutes.

The difference between the time it takes to swim 3 miles in warm water and the time it takes to swim 3 miles in cold water is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To find out how many cups Juan needs to reduce, we first need to determine how many cups he currently drinks. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, and Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, we need to know the daily recommended amount of coffee.

Let's assume the daily recommended amount of coffee is x cups. Since Octavia drinks half of this amount, she drinks x/2 cups. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

We are given that the daily recommended amount of coffee is 4 cups. So, x = 4. 

Now, we can find out how many cups Juan currently drinks: 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups.

Since Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake to 4 cups, we subtract 4 from 20 to find the reduction: 20 - 4 = 16 cups.

The final answer is: 16"

"To find the average weight of the 3 friends, we need to first find their individual weights. 

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. 
Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, so Bob's weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we need to find the average weight of the 3 friends. To do this, we add their weights and divide by 3. 
Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3 
Average weight = (150 + 130 + 260) / 3 
Average weight = 540 / 3 
Average weight = 180

Initial angle of the pyramid = 32 degrees
Angle the sun moves per hour = 5 degrees
Number of hours the sun moves = 10 hours

Final angle = Initial angle + (Angle the sun moves per hour * Number of hours)
Final angle = 32 + (5 * 10)
Final angle = 32 + 50
Final angle = 82 degrees

"To find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of candles he needs. Since one son is 12 and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Typically, birthday candles are one for each year of age, so James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed by the number of candles per pack: 20 / 5 = 4.

Since James needs 4 packs of candles and each pack costs $3, the total amount he spends on candles is 4 * 3 = $12.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week and then convert that to pages. 

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we need to find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which is 105 / 1.5 = 70.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, she can read 2 * 70 = 140 pages in 105 minutes.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we add the pages she read in the first week to the pages she read in the second week: 140 + 100 = 240.

In 7 years, his nephew's age will be x + 7. 

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. 
So, we can set up the equation: 51 = 3(x + 7). 

Now, let's solve the equation: 
51 = 3x + 21 
51 - 21 = 3x 
30 = 3x 
x = 30 / 3 
x = 10

"To find out how many goals Mark and Anna scored, we need to first determine their individual goal counts. 

Since Richie scored 80 goals and he scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can set up an equation to find Mark's goal count: 
Richie's goals - 20 = Mark's goals
80 - 20 = 60
Mark scored 60 goals.

Next, we know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. We can set up an equation to find Anna's goal count:
Richie's goals - 45 = Anna's goals
80 - 45 = 35
Anna scored 35 goals.

Now that we know the individual goal counts, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:
Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how many action figures he can buy each day and then add them up.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. He has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week, which is 7 days. 

First, let's find out how much he can spend each day: $70 / 7 days = $10 per day.

Since he spent $10 per day on wooden action figures from Sunday to Wednesday, he spent a total of $10 * 4 = $40 on wooden action figures.

Now, let's find out how many wooden action figures he bought: $40 / $5 = 8 wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He still has $30 left ($70 - $40 = $30).

Now, let's find out how many plastic action figures he can buy: $30 / $2 = 15 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have 8 wooden action figures and 15 plastic action figures.

8 (wooden action figures) + 15 (plastic action figures) = 23 action figures.

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is: 
20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is: 
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is: 
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month.

- Total cost = $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00

Total revenue:
- They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each. 
- Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00 = $70.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= $70.00 - $33.00

"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18.

The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4% for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% higher than 520.

To do this, we can calculate 4% of 520 and add it to 520.

4% of 520 is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.

The temperature Maggie should set the oven to is 520 + 20.8 = 540.8.

However, since temperature is usually measured in whole numbers, we can round this to the nearest whole number.

"To find the total number of utensils brought by Judy, we first need to determine how many cups and dishes she brought. 

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups Judy brought is 12, and the total number of dishes she brought is 24. The total number of cups her friend brought is 40, and the total number of dishes her friend brought is 44.

To find the total number of utensils brought by Judy, we add the number of cups and dishes she brought: 12 + 24 = 36.

"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we need to first find the total number of pairs of contacts Pete will have, and then the total cost of the contacts.

Since 90 contacts last 45 days, we can find the number of pairs of contacts per day by dividing 90 by 45. However, since we are looking for the number of pairs, we will divide 90 by 2 (since a pair is 2 contacts). 

90 / 2 = 45 pairs of contacts per 45 days.

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, he will have 2 * 45 = 90 pairs of contacts.

The original price of each box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (10% = 0.1).

$100 * 0.1 = $10

The discounted price of each box is $100 - $10 = $90.

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 * $90 = $180.

To find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs of contacts.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units there are. 

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8

Since each 200-calorie unit requires 100 ml of water, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by 100.

8 * 100 = 800

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's assume the number of blue jelly beans is x. 

Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99x.

Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of green jelly beans is 1.01x.

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can set up the equation: x + 0.99x + 1.01x = 4500.

Combine like terms: 3.00x = 4500.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 1500.

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans. The number of red jelly beans is 0.99x = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485.

The number of green jelly beans is 1.01x = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515.

To find the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans, subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans: 1515 - 1485 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM. 
After the first increase, his speed is 52 WPM. 
He increases his speed by 5 WPM again, so the third measurement will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we have the three measurements: 47, 52, and 57. 

To find the average, we add the three measurements and divide by 3: 
(47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"To find the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then subtract the weight change for the first option from the weight change for the second option.

For the first option (eating Cheerios), Martin loses 1.25 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he will lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

For the second option (eating donuts), Martin gains 1.75 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he will gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks is the weight gain for the second option minus the weight loss for the first option: 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

The final answer is: 2.5"
"To find the total number of people attending, we need to break down the information given:

1. Alex invites 100 people via email, and each of them invites 2 friends. So, the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

2. Alex then calls 10 friends and 8 of them say they will bring their spouses. This means 8 couples will be attending, which is 8 * 2 = 16 people. So, the total number of people Alex's friends are bringing is 10 + 16 = 26.

3. To find the total number of people attending, we add the people invited via email and the people Alex's friends are bringing: 300 + 26 = 326.

However, we also need to include Alex herself, so the total number of people attending is 326 + 1 = 327.

The final answer is: 327"
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to find the weight of the Papillon first, then multiply it by 44.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. 

The cost of the boots on eBay is $13. 
The shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

So, the total cost of the boots on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

The total cost of the boots on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to reach or exceed 20 feet. 

Since the beanstalk doubles in height every day and starts at 4 feet, we can calculate its height for each day as follows:

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let Jerry's current age be 'x'. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can write the equation: 
x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get: 
x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get: 
-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get: 
x = 10

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 
10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown, and then subtract the deposit he has already paid.

The base price of one implant is $2000, and the base price of two implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. 

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the two implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already paid a deposit of $600. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour at work, to find out how many hours he needs to work to pay for the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it can be represented as 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, it can be represented as 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. 
One angle is twice the smallest angle: 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees.
One angle is three times the smallest angle: 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

8 quarters = 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
6 dimes = 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

Total amount of money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball
= 345 / 5
= 69

"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%, we first need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds. 

So, the weight he increases the 8-pound weight to is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds. 

Since he then uses a weight two pounds lighter than that, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds. 

12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down year by year.

Year 1:
- Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift.
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so he buys 12 games.
- He gets 5 games for Christmas.
- Total games in Year 1: 5 (birthday) + 12 (bought) + 5 (Christmas) = 22 games.

Year 2:
- He already has 22 games from Year 1.
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so he buys 12 games.
- He gets 5 games for Christmas.
- Total games in Year 2: 22 (previous games) + 12 (bought) + 5 (Christmas) = 39 games.

Year 3:
- He already has 39 games from the previous years.
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so he buys 24 games.
- He gets 5 games for Christmas.
- Total games in Year 3: 39 (previous games) + 24 (bought) + 5 (Christmas) = 68 games.

Total games after 3 years: 68 games."
"To find the rate at which the plane travels, we need to divide the distance it traveled by the time it took. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Since the question asks for the additional hours it would take, we need to subtract the initial 3 hours from the total time.

Additional hours = Total time - Initial time
Additional hours = 5 hours - 3 hours
Additional hours = 2 hours

"To find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to first find out how many pounds Ruiz makes in an hour. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how many pounds he makes in an hour, we divide 120 by 2. 
120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour. 
3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, we know that both Ruiz and Marissa make 60 and 45 pounds of chocolates per hour respectively. 

In 12 hours, Ruiz will make 60 * 12 = 720 pounds of chocolates.
In 12 hours, Marissa will make 45 * 12 = 540 pounds of chocolates.

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260.

"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the total number of cups sold and the total revenue from each period, then add them together.

In the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
Total cups sold in the first four hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups
Total revenue in the first four hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

In the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
Total cups sold in the next two hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups
Total revenue in the next two hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

Total revenue from selling lemonade for 6 hours = Total revenue in the first four hours + Total revenue in the next two hours
Total revenue = $30 + $12 = $42

"To find out how many rotations the tires undergo in a month, we need to multiply the number of rotations per 2 miles by the number of miles driven in a month. 

Rotations per 2 miles: 725
Miles driven in a month: 400

Rotations per month = (725 * 2) * 400 = 580,000 rotations per month

Now, we need to find out how many months the tire can last before it needs to be replaced. 

Total rotations allowed: 10,440,000
Rotations per month: 580,000

Months before replacement = Total rotations allowed / Rotations per month
Months before replacement = 10,440,000 / 580,000
Months before replacement = 18

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find out how many years the tire can last by dividing the number of months by 12.

Years before replacement = Months before replacement / 12
Years before replacement = 18 / 12
Years before replacement = 1.5

"To find out how much Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3). The discount amount is $60 * 0.3 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost of the items. $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional tax to the final cost.

Finally, we subtract the final cost from the initial amount of money Joe has to find out how much he will have left. $50 - $42 = $8.

"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of croissants he wants to make is:
4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, the total number of croissants is:
28 dozen * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we know it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how much butter is needed for 336 croissants, we need to multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen:
336 croissants * (1/4 pound/croissant) = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately and then add them together.

The number of cars towed on the first three days is 10 * 3 = 30.

The number of cars towed on the remaining days is 7 (days remaining in the week) - 3 (first three days) = 4 days. Since 4 fewer cars were towed on each of these days, the number of cars towed on these days is 10 - 4 = 6. So, the total number of cars towed on the remaining days is 6 * 4 = 24.

The total number of cars towed that week is 30 + 24 = 54.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height (4 feet) and Adam's current height (40 inches), and then divide that by his growth rate (2 inches per year).

First, let's convert the required height to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the required height and Adam's current height: 48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches.

Finally, let's divide the difference by Adam's growth rate: 8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars, then calculate his commission on that profit.

First, let's find the total cost of the cars: 
10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000

The company paid 30% of the cost to acquire the cars, so the amount they paid is:
$250,000 * 0.3 = $75,000

The profit from selling the cars is the selling price minus the cost:
$250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

James gets a 10% commission on the profit:
$175,000 * 0.1 = $17,500

So, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of men who can stay upright, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Given that 25% of the riders can stay upright, and there are 100 riders, we can calculate the number of riders who can stay upright as follows:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25

Now, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women, we can calculate:

60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15

Since the remaining riders are men, we can find the number of men by subtracting the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10. 

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to find the price of the gold and silver jewels first.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

Given that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and add them together.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the time it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed between them and then divide the distance between them by this relative speed.

The relative speed is the difference between their speeds, which is 70 mph (Tom's speed) - 55 mph (Bob's speed) = 15 mph.

The distance between them is 75 miles.

Time = Distance / Relative Speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to first determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch by subtracting 6 from Naomi's catch.

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught by adding 3 to Darren's catch.

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's assume Manny misses x classes. Since there are 10 total classes, he will attend 10 - x classes.

The total cost of the classes he attends is the number of classes he attends multiplied by the cost per class, which is $10. So, the total cost is 10 * 10 = $100.

The cost of the classes he misses is the number of classes he misses multiplied by the cost per class, which is $60. So, the cost of the classes he misses is x * 60.

Since his parents won't sign him up again if the total cost exceeds $100, we can set up the following inequality:

10 * 10 = x * 60
100 = 60x

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 60:

x = 100 / 60
x = 1.67

Since Manny can't miss a fraction of a class, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Manny can miss 1 class before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total weekly production, we first need to determine how many customers each person processes in a week. 

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jewel's weekly production is 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes twice the number of customers Jewel does in a day. So, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

Julie's weekly production is 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for the two is the sum of their individual weekly productions: 350 (Jewel) + 700 (Julie) = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Paisley ran 4 miles.

"To find the cost of 5 apples, we need to first find the cost of one apple. 

Cost of 4 apples = $5.20
Cost of 1 apple = $5.20 / 4 = $1.30

Now, we can find the cost of 5 apples.
Cost of 5 apples = $1.30 * 5 = $6.50

To find the cost of 5 oranges, we need to first find the cost of one orange.

Cost of 3 oranges = $3.30
Cost of 1 orange = $3.30 / 3 = $1.10

Now, we can find the cost of 5 oranges.
Cost of 5 oranges = $1.10 * 5 = $5.50

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges.
Total cost = Cost of 5 apples + Cost of 5 oranges
Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50
Total cost = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the hole. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we need to multiply the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To find the total amount Tim will make in a year, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and the bonus, then multiply by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his monthly salary:
5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Next, let's calculate the bonus:
Bonus = half a month's salary = $20,000 / 2 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly income:
Total monthly income = new monthly salary + bonus = $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

Finally, let's calculate the total annual income:
Total annual income = total monthly income * 12 = $31,000 * 12 = $372,000

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got a $2 discount. So, the total cost is:
20 * $20 = $400
$400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price of each pomegranate is $30, and there's a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost is:
20 * $30 = $600
10% of $600 is 0.1 * $600 = $60

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first month, the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Let's denote the total sales from green hats as G. Then, the sales from red hats can be represented as 0.5G. We know that 0.5G = 400.

2. To find the total sales from green hats in the first month, we can solve the equation 0.5G = 400 for G. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get G = 800.

3. Now that we know the total sales from green hats in the first month, we can find the total sales from both red and green hats in the first month. Total sales in the first month = 0.5G + G = 800 + 400 = 1200.

4. In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. Let's denote the total sales in the second month as S2. Then, S2 = (3/4) * 1200.

5. To find the total sales in the second month, we can multiply 1200 by 3/4. S2 = (3/4) * 1200 = 900.

6. To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the total sales of the first and second months. Total sales in two months = 1200 + 900 = 2100.

The final answer is: 132"
"To find out how much candy each person would have after sharing equally, we need to add up the total amount of candy they have and then divide it by the number of people.

Total candy = Robert's candy + Cindy's candy + Aaron's candy
Total candy = 3 pounds + 5 pounds + 4 pounds
Total candy = 12 pounds

There are 3 people sharing the candy, so we divide the total candy by 3.

Candy per person = Total candy / Number of people
Candy per person = 12 pounds / 3
Candy per person = 4 pounds

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much change Adam got, we need to calculate the total cost of the candies and subtract that from the amount he paid.

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to subtract the good days already recorded from the total number of days. 

Total days = 30
Good days already recorded = 12 (first 8 days + 3 more days)
Neutral days already recorded = 8
Bad days already recorded = 8

First, we need to find the number of neutral days that were not recorded in the first 24 days. 
Total neutral days = 8 (already recorded) + (30 - 24) = 6 (since the first 24 days were 8 good and 8 bad, leaving 4 days for neutral)
However, we know that the first 8 days were neutral, so the 6 neutral days are actually the remaining 6 days after the first 8 days. 

Now, let's find the total number of good days left in the month. 
Total good days left = Total days - (Good days already recorded + Bad days already recorded + Neutral days already recorded in the first 24 days)
Total good days left = 30 - (12 + 8 + 0) 
Total good days left = 30 - 20
Total good days left = 10

"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to first determine what ""twice the number of books that Sally has"" means. Let's call the number of books Sally has ""x"". 

""Twice the number of books that Sally has"" would be 2x. 

Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has, we can write an equation: 

Janey's books = 2x + 3 

We know Janey has 21 books, so we can set up the equation: 

21 = 2x + 3 

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation: 

21 - 3 = 2x + 3 - 3 
18 = 2x 

Next, we need to get x by itself. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2: 

18 / 2 = 2x / 2 
9 = x 

So Sally has 9 books. 

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we need to find the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches):

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs 8 more toys.
   Total toys needed so far: 4 (initial toys) + 8 (additional toys) = 12 toys
3. When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs.
   Total dogs now: 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (initial additional dogs) + 16 (new dogs) = 28 dogs
   Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 28 more toys.
   Total toys needed so far: 12 (previous toys) + 28 (new toys) = 40 toys
4. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys.
   Total toys needed: 40 (previous toys) - 3 (unnecessary toys) = 37 toys

Therefore, James needs 37 toys in total."
"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to calculate the remaining amount after Dylan and Frances' investments.

"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we first need to determine how many signatures they currently have in total. 

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 

Total signatures = Carol's signatures + Jennifer's signatures
Total signatures = 20 + 44
Total signatures = 64

Since they want to reach 100 signatures by the end of the summer, we need to find out how many more signatures they need to collect.

Signatures needed = Total signatures they want - Total signatures they currently have
Signatures needed = 100 - 64
Signatures needed = 36

The sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to find out how much she earns per day. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

If Karen works 3 hours per day, she earns $20 * 3 = $60 per day.

To find out how much she earns in two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2: $60 * 2 = $120.

"To find the total weight of the 9 adults, we need to multiply the average weight of an adult by the number of adults. 

Total weight = 80 kg/adult * 9 adults = 720 kg

Since the elevator supports a maximum load of 700 kg, we need to find the difference between the total weight and the maximum load.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max and Summer have. 

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less than Max, Max must have 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, but we don't know how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. However, we can find out how many cookies Max has in relation to Summer. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Max has 73 - 23 = 50 cookies less than Summer. 

Since Max has 73 cookies, Summer must have 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now we know how many cookies Katarina, Max, and Summer have: Katarina has 68, Max has 73, and Summer has 96. 

To find the total number of cookies, we add these numbers together: 68 + 73 + 96 = 237.

The final answer is: 237"
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to first subtract the 20cm added to the bottom of the dress. 

Final length = Original length + 50% of original length + 20cm
140cm = Original length + 0.5 * Original length + 20cm

Combine like terms:
140cm = 1.5 * Original length + 20cm

Subtract 20cm from both sides:
120cm = 1.5 * Original length

Divide both sides by 1.5:
Original length = 120cm / 1.5
Original length = 80cm

"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. 

Since there are two twins and one triplet, the total age is 2T + t = 44. 

We also know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so T = t + 7.

Substituting T = t + 7 into the first equation, we get 2(t + 7) + t = 44.

Expanding the equation, we get 2t + 14 + t = 44.

Combining like terms, we get 3t + 14 = 44.

Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get 3t = 30.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get t = 10.

Now that we know the age of the triplet, we can find the age of the older twin. Since T = t + 7, T = 10 + 7 = 17.

"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year) and 10 (the number of years).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 coins more than Rong. 
So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year = 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year = 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings = 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings = 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, but we don't know the total bill yet. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check is $40 + $60 = $100.

"To find out how many hours they have to fundraise, we need to first determine how much they need to raise per hour to reach their goal. 

The total amount they need to raise is $6300, and they have already raised $2100 in 3 hours. 

The amount they need to raise in total is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

Since they have already raised $2100 in 3 hours, the amount they need to raise per hour is $4200 / 3 = $1400 per hour.

To find out how many hours they need to fundraise in total, we can divide the total amount they need to raise ($4200) by the amount they need to raise per hour ($1400).

$4200 / $1400 = 3 hours.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
$50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00. Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide the total amount of money Erin has by the cost of each scoop.

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4

This means Erin can buy 4 scoops of ice cream. However, the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 free, so Erin can buy 2 scoops and get 1 free, or 3 scoops total.

"To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each person eats in two weeks and then subtract the difference from Amy's total from Ginger's total.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

The difference between Amy's and Ginger's remaining candy is 58 - 44 = 14.

"To find the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends, we first need to find the total number of slices they ate. Since there are 5 people in total, and 2 of them ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

2/3 * 5 pizzas * 12 slices per pizza = 2/3 * 60 = 40 slices

However, since Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we need to consider that Bryce ate 2/3 of 1 pizza, and the other two friends ate 2/3 of 2 pizzas. So, the correct calculation is:

2/3 * (1 + 2) pizzas * 12 slices per pizza = 2/3 * 3 pizzas * 12 slices per pizza = 2/3 * 36 = 24 slices

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends. They ate ¾ of their pizzas, and there are 2 friends, so we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

3/4 * 2 pizzas * 12 slices per pizza = 3/4 * 24 = 18 slices

Now, let's add the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends and the two remaining friends:

24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices

Since there were 5 pizzas in total, with 12 slices per pizza, the total number of slices is:

5 pizzas * 12 slices per pizza = 60 slices

Now, let's subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:

60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat. 

The cat eats the sausages in 30 minutes. 
2/3 of 30 minutes is (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

So, the dog eats the sausages in 20 minutes.

To find the average time, we need to add the time taken by the cat and the dog and divide by 2.

Average time = (30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches
Adding the 4 inches, we get:
96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches, and it is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes ""x"". Then, we can write the equation:

100 = 9x + 10

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us:

90 = 9x

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us:

x = 10

"To find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we need to calculate the number of windows from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each. So, the total number of windows from students' cars is 64 * 4 = 256.

Next, let's find the number of windows from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each. Since Hannah smashed 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, we need to find 3/4ths of 32 * 2. First, we find 32 * 2 = 64. Then, we multiply 64 by 3/4, which is the same as multiplying 64 by 0.75. So, 64 * 0.75 = 48.

Now, we add the number of windows from students' cars and teachers' cars to find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah. 256 + 48 = 304.

6 adults will eat 1 s'more each, so 6 * 1 = 6 smores. 
Total smores needed = 18 + 6 = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 smores, we need to divide the total number of smores needed by 8 to find out how many sleeves are needed. 
24 smores / 8 smores per sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the total number of sleeves needed by 3 to find out how many boxes are needed. 
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first find their individual ages.

Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can start by finding her father's age. It is mentioned that Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 

Let's denote Dora's father's age as F and Dora's age as D. We have the equation: F = 2D + 8. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can substitute D = 15 into the equation to find F.

F = 2(15) + 8
F = 30 + 8
F = 38

Now that we know Dora's father is 38 years old, we can find her mother's age. It is mentioned that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 

Let's denote Dora's mother's age as M. We have the equation: M = F - 4. Since F = 38, we can substitute F into the equation to find M.

M = 38 - 4
M = 34

Now that we know Dora's age (15), her father's age (38), and her mother's age (34), we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.

Total combined age = D + F + M
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven, and Clara has 20 books, we can set up the equation: 2 * Steven's books = 20. 

To find Steven's books, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: Steven's books = 20 / 2 = 10.

Now we know that Steven has 10 books. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, we can find Alice's books by adding 6 to Steven's books: Alice's books = 10 + 6 = 16.

Now we can compare Clara's and Alice's book counts: Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books. To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract Alice's books from Clara's books: 20 - 16 = 4.

"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to find the total number of girls in both classes. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, and there are 80 students in total, we can set up an equation to find the number of students in each class.

Let x be the number of students in each class. Since there are two classes, the total number of students is 2x. We know that 40% of 2x are girls, so the number of girls is 0.4(2x) = 0.8x.

We also know that the total number of students is 80, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 80

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 80 / 2
x = 40

So, there are 40 students in each class. Now, we can find the number of boys in each class. Since 40% of the students are girls, 60% are boys. The number of boys in each class is 0.6(40) = 24.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since each large sticker is worth one large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading her large stickers.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (40 - 20 = 20) for small buttons. 
Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading her large stickers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has:
- Small buttons: 27 (from small stickers) + 60 (from large stickers) = 87 small buttons
- Large buttons: 20

Total buttons = 87 (small buttons) + 20 (large buttons) = 107 buttons

The final answer is: 107"
"To find the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to add up the matches he played on each day.

On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches.

Now, let's add up the total number of matches: 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7 matches.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of votes against the new regulation is x. Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice as many as the votes against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of people on the council is 33, and this is the sum of the votes in favor and against the new regulation. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Since x represents the number of votes against the new regulation, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2x, which is 2 * 11 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"

The final amount you will pay after the discount is $133."
"To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we need to multiply the number of songs in each playlist by the number of playlists and then multiply the result by the length of each song in hours.

First, we multiply the number of songs in each playlist by the number of playlists: 
300 songs/playlist * 20 playlists = 6000 songs

Then, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song in hours:
6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60000 hours

The total number of hours the 20 playlists will last is 60000."
"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we first need to find the number of people who think horse #2 will win and then the number of people who think horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

The remaining people are 50 - 10 = 40 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win.
60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. 
So, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 40 - 24 = 16 people.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total number of puppies Jana has, we first need to find the total number of Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and we now know that there are 18 Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total Puppies = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much Jayden needs to buy the camera, we first need to calculate how much money he has after receiving the money from his sister. 

Jayden initially had $70. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. 

So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as x. Since the first house needs 1/2 of what the second house needs, the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles.

The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + (x/2) + x = 250

To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms:

5x = 500

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

Now that we know the second house needs 100 cases of shingles, we can find out how many the third house needs:

The third house needs x cases of shingles, which is 100 cases.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each person's purchase and then add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so her total is 3 x $2 = $6.
Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so his total is 5 x $1 = $5.
Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3, so his total is $3.

Now, let's add their totals together: $6 + $5 + $3 = $14.

"To find the number of pears George has, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas and add it to the number of bananas. 

First, let's find 45% of 200 bananas:
45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90

Now, let's add 90 to the number of bananas:
200 + 90 = 290

So, George has 290 pears. To find the total number of fruits, we need to add the number of bananas and pears:
200 (bananas) + 290 (pears) = 490

The final answer is: 490"
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the amount of money Marissa had initially. 

Initial amount of money = $80
Cost of the ball = $20

Remaining money = Initial amount of money - Cost of the ball
Remaining money = $80 - $20
Remaining money = $60

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars Marissa can buy with the remaining money. Each candy bar costs $5.

Number of candy bars = Remaining money / Cost of each candy bar
Number of candy bars = $60 / $5
Number of candy bars = 12

"To find out how much money Sam needs to spend, we first need to determine how many kilograms of oranges he needs to make 4 liters of juice. Since Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice, he would need 5 * 4 = 20 kilograms of oranges to make 4 liters of juice.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the oranges. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so 20 kilograms would cost 20 * 3 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how many books Ahmed read, we need to divide the number of books Ezra read by 2, since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. 

Ezra read 300 books, so Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we need to add the number of books Ezra read to the number of books Ahmed read, and then add the 150 more books Ezra decided to read.

Total books read by Ezra and Ahmed = 300 (Ezra) + 150 (Ahmed) = 450
Total books read by Ezra = 450 + 150 = 600

So, altogether, they have read 450 + 600 = 1050 books.

"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then add them together.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Her base pay for 5 hours is 5 * $15 = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day, which is $5. So, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her base pay for 2 hours is 2 * $15 = $30. Since she teaches less than or equal to 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Now, let's add her earnings for both days: $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents and there are 4 vanilla scents available, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.

The company sold 2 fruity scents and there are 8 fruity scents available, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold. 

Difference = Total number of vanilla scents sold - Total number of fruity scents sold
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we first need to calculate how much money he makes from selling the eggplants. 

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount he makes from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he already makes $60 from eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

He has 25 ears of corn, so to find out how much he should sell each ear for, we divide the total amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25). 

$75 / 25 = $3.

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total time Tatiana has available for soccer, video games, and reading, we need to add the hours she has on Saturday and Sunday. 

Total time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

She reads for 3 hours, so the remaining time is:
Remaining time = Total time - Time spent reading = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Now, we need to find the time spent playing soccer:
Time spent playing soccer = Remaining time - Time spent playing video games = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we need to divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time and multiply by 100:
Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time) * 100

"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps of the problem.

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils and gave 1/2 of them to Brandon. 
   1/2 of 50 is 50 * 0.5 = 25 pencils given to Brandon.
   So, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

2. Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie.
   3/5 of 25 is 25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils given to Charlie.
   So, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

Time to drive to the museum: 
Distance to the museum = 150 miles
Speed = 75 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 150 / 75 = 2 hours

Time to drive back home:
Since the distance is the same, the time will also be the same: 2 hours

Total time driving = 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours

Total time Jack is gone from home = Time driving + Time at the museum
= 4 hours + 6 hours
= 10 hours

"To find the total number of wheels needed for the toys, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles separately and then add them together.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each of the 57 cars, so the total number of wheels needed for the cars is 4 * 57 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each of the 73 motorcycles, so the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is 2 * 73 = 146.

The total number of wheels needed for both the cars and the motorcycles is 228 + 146 = 374.

Since Henry has a box with 650 wheels in it, the number of wheels left after assembling all the toys is 650 - 374 = 276.

"To find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to calculate the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so:
600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

Since Mike can get these movies for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie, the cost of the series is:
200 * $6 = $1200

Next, let's find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so first we need to find the number of remaining movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies remaining
40% of 400 is:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

The cost of the older movies is:
160 * $5 = $800

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies that are not in series or older movies:
400 - 160 = 240 movies

The cost of the remaining movies is:
240 * $10 = $2400

The total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection is the sum of the cost of the series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies:
$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

"To find the distance the Llesis family drove, we need to multiply their driving speed by the time they spent driving. 

Driving speed = 50 miles per hour
Driving time = Total time - Hiking time
Driving time = 6 hours - 1.5 hours
Driving time = 4.5 hours

Distance driven = Speed * Time
Distance driven = 50 * 4.5
Distance driven = 225 miles

To find the speed at which they hiked, we need to find half of their driving speed and subtract 5 miles per hour.

Half of driving speed = 50 / 2
Half of driving speed = 25 miles per hour
Hiking speed = Half of driving speed - 5
Hiking speed = 25 - 5
Hiking speed = 20 miles per hour

To find the distance they hiked, we multiply their hiking speed by the time they spent hiking.

Distance hiked = Speed * Time
Distance hiked = 20 * 1.5
Distance hiked = 30 miles

To find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked
Total distance = 225 + 30
Total distance = 255 miles

"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them gets from enemies, berries, and the timer.

Let's assume Emma's score from enemies is x. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's score from enemies is x + 8.

Emma's score from berries is 3 (since she collects 3 berries), and Ava collects 3 + 3 = 6 berries, so Ava's score from berries is 6.

Now, let's consider the timer. Let's assume Emma finishes the level in t seconds. Then, Ava finishes the level in t + 4 seconds. The points from the timer are 30 points per second, so Emma gets 30t points from the timer, and Ava gets 30(t + 4) points from the timer.

The total score for Emma is x + 3 + 30t, and the total score for Ava is x + 8 + 6 + 30(t + 4).

We can simplify Ava's total score to x + 8 + 6 + 30t + 120 = x + 134 + 30t.

The difference between their scores is (x + 134 + 30t) - (x + 3 + 30t) = x - x + 134 - 3 + 30t - 30t = 131.

"To find the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on usual days and the extra days to get the total number of times they ride in a week: 15 + 12 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's break down the information given:

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.

After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. The number of orange fish he bought would then be 2x (since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish).

The total number of fish in the pet store tank was 17, and this includes both white and orange fish. Since Bob bought all the fish from the tank, the total number of fish he bought is 17.

The total number of fish in Bob's pond after buying more fish is 7 (initial fish) + 17 (bought fish) = 24.

The number of white fish in Bob's pond after buying more fish is 4 (initial white fish) + x (white fish bought).

The number of orange fish in Bob's pond after buying more fish is 3 (initial orange fish) + 2x (orange fish bought).

Since the total number of fish in the pond is 24, we can set up the equation:

4 + x + 3 + 2x = 24

Combine like terms:

3x + 7 = 24

Subtract 7 from both sides:

3x = 17

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 17/3

x = 5.67

Since the number of fish must be a whole number, and we are dealing with a real-world scenario where you can't buy a fraction of a fish, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of white fish Bob bought, and we know that the total number of fish he bought is 17. We can set up another equation using the total number of fish bought:

x + 2x = 17

Combine like terms:

3x = 17

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 17/3

x = 5.67

However, we can also set up an equation using the fact that the total number of fish in the pond is 24:

4 + x + 3 + 2x = 24

3x + 7 = 24

Subtract 7 from both sides:

3x = 17

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 17/3

x = 5.67

However, we can also set up an equation using the fact that the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:

Subtract 2x from both sides:

3 = 8

This equation is not solvable, which means that the initial assumption that the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish is not correct. However, we can set up another equation using the fact that the total number of fish in the pond is 24:

"To calculate the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total miles driven per week and the total gallons of gas consumed per week.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per week:
- Distance between home and office: 5 miles (one way)
- Since Andy drives to and from work, the total distance per day is: 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles
- Total miles driven per week: 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles/week

Next, let's calculate the total gallons of gas consumed per week:
- Fuel efficiency: 10 MPG
- Total miles driven per week: 50 miles
- Total gallons of gas consumed per week: 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week

Now, let's calculate the total money spent on gas per week:
- Price of gas: $3/gallon
- Total gallons of gas consumed per week: 5 gallons
- Total money spent on gas per week: 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15/week

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent, and then add them together.

The value of the quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

The value of the twenties is 10 * $20 = $200. Since she spent 3/5 of the twenties, the amount she spent is 3/5 * $200 = $120.

The total amount of money she spent is $35 + $120 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

For tomatoes: 5 plants * 22 tomatoes/plant = 110 tomatoes

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to find the total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 = 0.25 or 25% of the total. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 = 0.125 or 12.5% of the total.

The total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 25% + 12.5% = 37.5%.

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the percentage of smart and analog TVs from 100% to find the percentage of OLED TVs: 100% - 37.5% = 62.5%.

Now, we can find the number of OLED TVs sold by multiplying the total number of TVs sold (40) by the percentage of OLED TVs (62.5% or 0.625): 
40 * 0.625 = 25

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature difference between the current temperature and the freezing point. 

The current temperature during the day is 45 degrees. The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than the day, so it's 45 - 33 = 12 degrees. 

The temperature difference between the freezing point and the night temperature is 32 - 12 = 20 degrees. 

Since each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, we need to divide the temperature difference by the heat produced per log to find out how many logs are needed. 

20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs.

"To find the total number of seashells, we first need to find the number of groups and then the number of groups that brought back seashells. 

First, we find the number of groups: 
Number of people = 90
Number of people per group = 9
Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Next, we find the number of groups that brought back seashells:
Fraction of groups that brought back seashells = 3/5
Number of groups that brought back seashells = Number of groups * Fraction of groups that brought back seashells
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 6

Now, we find the total number of seashells:
Number of seashells per group = 2
Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total number of seashells = 6 * 2
Total number of seashells = 12

Initially, there were 172 people on the train.

At the first stop, 47 people got off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
172 - 47 = 125

Then, 13 people got on, so we add 13 to 125:
125 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people got off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
138 - 38 = 100

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. On his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, which was $10. So, Sally's starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. 

Now, let's calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours:

Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

Bubbles has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since Bubbles can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage 30%, so we will round to the nearest whole number that will make the percentage 30% or more. 

To find the total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats, we can set up the equation: 

(14 + x) * 0.3 = 30% of (14 + x), where x is the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy.

However, since we are looking for the number of stuffed goats, we can set up the equation as follows: 

(14 + x) * 0.3 = 30

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.3: 

14 + x = 30 / 0.3
14 + x = 100
x = 100 - 14
x = 86

However, this is the number of stuffed animals she needs to have in total to make the percentage 30%. Since she already has 14 stuffed animals, we need to subtract 14 from 86 to find the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy: 

86 - 14 = 72

However, this is still not the correct answer because we are looking for the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage 30% or more. We need to find the smallest number of stuffed goats that will make the percentage 30% or more. 

Let's try a different approach. We can set up the equation as follows: 

(14 + x) / (14 + x) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 

100(14 + x) = 30(14 + x)

Expanding the equation: 

1400 + 100x = 420 + 30x

Subtracting 30x from both sides: 

1400 + 70x = 420

Subtracting 1400 from both sides: 

70x = -980

Dividing both sides by 70: 

x = -980 / 70
x = -14

However, this is not a valid answer because we can't have a negative number of stuffed animals. We need to try a different approach. 

Let's try to find the number of stuffed animals she needs to have in total to make the percentage 30% or more. We can set up the equation as follows:

"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in 2 weeks and 1 week.

In 2 weeks, there are 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in 2 weeks.

In 1 week, there are 7 days. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in 1 week.

Total hours Kris has played = 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

Since Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total hours required:

Hours still needed to play = 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between the two distances.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 70 miles/hour x 2 hours = 140 miles

The distance between the two cars will be the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars:
Distance = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the premium first. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold, which is $600 + $300 = $900. 

30% of $900 is 0.3 x $900 = $270.

The total cost of the ring is the cost of the diamond and gold plus the premium, which is $900 + $270 = $1170.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third grade: 340 students passed
- Fourth grade: 40 students passed
- Fifth grade: Since the pass rate for the fifth grade is twice the pass rate of the fourth grade, and 40 students passed in the fourth grade, 2 * 40 = 80 students passed in the fifth grade.

Now, let's find the total number of students in each grade:

- Third grade: 500 students
- Fourth grade: 100 students
- Fifth grade: 400 students

The total number of students in the school is 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 students.

The total number of students who passed is 340 + 40 + 80 = 460 students.

To find the overall pass rate, we divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students in the school and multiply by 100:

(460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%

The final answer is: 46"
"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to determine how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch, and each bag has 72 chips, we need to find out how many square inches Milo can make with two bags of chips. 

First, we multiply the number of chips in one bag by 2 to find the total number of chips: 72 * 2 = 144 chips.

Next, we divide the total number of chips by the number of chips needed to make one square inch: 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall, and he can make 12 square inches with the glass chips, we need to find out how long the mosaic can be. 

To do this, we divide the total square inches by the height of the mosaic: 12 / 3 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount of tea each group of students drank and add them together.

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so the total amount of tea they drank is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

16 students drank 2 quarts each, so the total amount of tea they drank is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we need to divide the total amount of tea consumed by 4 to find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party.

However, we are given that there are 10 quarts of tea left from the party. To find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to add the remaining tea to the total amount of tea consumed.

Total tea at the beginning of the party = 38 (consumed) + 10 (remaining) = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4: 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to first determine how many candies he has in total. 

Dale initially ordered 100 candies and then sold 150. However, he still had 100 candies left after selling 150, because he didn't have those 100 yet. Then, he ordered 100 more. 

So, the total number of candies he has is 100 (initially ordered) + 100 (ordered later) = 200 candies. 

Since he sold 150 candies, the number of candies he still needs to sell is 200 - 150 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month and then subtract the initial number of students from it.

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.

- At the end of January, the number of students doubles: 10 * 2 = 20
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again: 20 * 2 = 40
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again: 40 * 2 = 80
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again: 80 * 2 = 160
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again: 160 * 2 = 320

Now, let's subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May: 320 - 10 = 310

"To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25).

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (7 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were lost.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 x 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 x 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used and the ones dropped from the initial number of marshmallows. 

Total marshmallows used = 9 (John) + 9 (DeSean) = 18
Marshmallows dropped = 3
Total marshmallows used and dropped = 18 + 3 = 21

Initial number of marshmallows = 35
Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14

Since there are 14 marshmallows left, and there are 2 kids, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many each kid can have.

14 / 2 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then determine how many quarters they use.

Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. Since he can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, he uses 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

One of his friends is significantly worse and can play for half as long as Jack, so they play for 240 / 2 = 120 minutes. This friend uses 120 / 20 = 6 quarters.

The other two friends are significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes. Each of them uses 360 / 20 = 18 quarters.

Since there are two friends who play for 360 minutes, they use a total of 2 * 18 = 36 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 (Jack) + 6 (worse friend) + 36 (better friends) = 54 quarters.

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total amount of money used is 54 * $0.25 = $13.50.

The final answer is: $13.50"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as Z, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of salt as S, the amount of sugar as S, and the amount of oil as O.

We know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so F = Z.

We also know that she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = S.

We know that she uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.

We also know that she uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.

Since F = Z, we can substitute Z for F in the equation S = 2Z, so S = 2F.

Now we have O = 2S and S = 2F. We can substitute S = 2F into the equation O = 2S, so O = 2(2F) = 4F.

Since F = Z, we can substitute F for Z, so O = 4F = 4Z.

We know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, and it is made up of Z + F + S + S + O. Since F = Z and S = S = 2Z, we can substitute these values into the equation, so the total amount is Z + Z + 2Z + 2Z + 4Z = 10.

Combine like terms to get 10Z = 10.

Divide both sides by 10 to get Z = 1.

Now that we know Z = 1, we can find F = Z = 1, S = 2Z = 2, and O = 4Z = 4.

The final answer is: 4"

The total amount of money John spent is $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Cupcakes already have = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy = Total cupcakes needed - Cupcakes already have

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

4. In total, Joe sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars. So, he gave away a total of 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

5. To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the total number of cars he gave away from the initial number of cars he had: 40 - 24 = 16.

"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine the total amount raised by the students. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we know that there are 20 students and they all raised the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the number of students: $125,000 / 20 = $6,250.

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 480 + 240 = 720 minutes.

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first find the total number of cars in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break.

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 of the cars had left. This means that 1/2 of 70 had left, so 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars had left.

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot when Hunter got out of class for the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35.

However, the question asks for the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break. This would be the number of cars that were already there (70) plus the number of cars that arrived during the lunch break. Since 1/2 of the cars had left, 1/2 of the cars that were there initially (50) had left, and 1/2 of the 20 cars that arrived during the first break had left. 

1/2 of 50 is 25, and 1/2 of 20 is 10. So, 25 + 10 = 35 cars had left during the lunch break. This means that 70 - 35 = 35 cars remained. 

Since 35 cars remained, and 35 cars had left, the total number of cars that arrived during the lunch break is 35 + 35 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how much John makes in a day, we need to calculate the total amount he earns from one cycle and then multiply it by the number of cycles he does in a day.

Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20. So, the total amount he earns from one cycle is:
5 tasks * $1.20/task = $6.00 per cycle

Since John does 30 cycles a day, his daily earnings are:
$6.00/cycle * 30 cycles = $180.00 per day

To find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7:
$180.00/day * 7 days = $1260.00

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 
In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. 
So, in the second game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.

To find the total points Sasha scored, we add her points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, Smendrick has 3x cards, and Becca has 3x + 12 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has by substituting x = 47 into the expression 3x + 12:

Becca has 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"

Cindy had 5 green eggs.
She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

The cost of shipping is calculated as follows:
- Weight-based cost: 4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40
- Mileage-based cost: 20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60
- Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.99

The refund amount is 75% of the purchase price:
- Refund amount: $32 * 0.75 = $24

Now, let's calculate the total loss:
- Total loss = Total shipping cost - Refund amount
- Total loss = $2.99 - $24
However, since you cannot lose a negative amount of money, we need to recalculate the total loss by subtracting the refund amount from the shipping cost and then subtracting that from the purchase price.
- Total loss = Purchase price - (Refund amount - Shipping cost)
- Total loss = $32 - ($24 - $2.99)
- Total loss = $32 - $21.01
- Total loss = $10.99

The final answer is: $10.99"

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Total production for the first three weeks = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends per week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time she spends on TikTok per week:

- 18 videos * 4 minutes per video = 72 minutes
- 2 hours = 120 minutes
- 15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes
- Total time per week = 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes

Now, let's convert the total time per week to hours: 
282 minutes / 60 = 4.7 hours

Now, let's multiply the total time per week by 4 to find the total time per month:
4.7 hours * 4 = 18.8 hours

The final answer is: 18.8"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of the initial installation is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, we need to subtract these from the total number of items she has:

- Mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2
- Chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1
- Pictures: 20 - 10 = 10

The number of additional items is 2 mirrors, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item, so the total cost of the additional items is:

2 (mirrors) * $15.00 = $30.00
1 (chandelier) * $15.00 = $15.00
10 (pictures) * $15.00 = $150.00

The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

The total cost is the sum of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Anthony has saved, and then calculate 40% more than that amount.

Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we need to find 40% of $30.00 and add it to $30.00. 

40% of $30.00 is 0.4 x $30.00 = $12.00. 

So, Roy has saved $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to determine the lifting capacity of each person relative to Pompei. 

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches. 
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches. 
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 
480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total distance traveled by Mason, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours, and then add them together.

Distance = Speed x Time

For the first 4 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles

For the next 6 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, one kangaroo would take 18 hours multiplied by 3, which equals 54 hours.

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. Since it takes one kangaroo 54 hours to travel across the highway, it would take a turtle twice as long, which is 54 hours multiplied by 2, equaling 108 hours.

However, we are asked about four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. Since the speed of the turtles is halved, the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway would be the same as it would take for one turtle, which is 108 hours.

Therefore, it would take four turtles 108 hours to travel across the highway.

The final answer is: 108"
"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we need to determine the number of dishes each person made.

Kora made 20 dishes. 
Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we add up the number of dishes made by each person: 
20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution, and then subtract the amount she needs to buy the laptop.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Erika has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution: 
$150 (payment) + $80 (mom's contribution) = $230

Since the price of the new laptop is reduced by $200 when she trades in her old laptop, the new price of the laptop is:
$600 - $200 = $400

Now, we know that Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop. So, the total amount of money she has is:
$400 (new price of the laptop) - $50 (amount she needs) = $350

However, this is the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution. To find out how much money she had in her purse initially, we need to subtract her payment and her mom's contribution from this total amount:
$350 (total amount) - $230 (payment and mom's contribution) = $120

Therefore, Erika had $120 in her purse initially.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many slices Adam has initially, we need to calculate the total number of slices from the large and small apples. 

3 large apples can be sliced into 3 * 5 = 15 slices.
5 small apples can be sliced into 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

So, the total number of slices is 15 + 15 = 30.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces. 

The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow, and he has 3 cows. So, the total amount of milk he currently produces is 5 * 3 = 15 liters.

To find out how many more cows he needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we need to subtract the current amount of milk from the target amount. 

25 - 15 = 10 liters.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to divide the remaining amount of milk by the amount each cow produces to find out how many more cows are needed.

10 / 5 = 2

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of each used part and subtract it from the original length of the glue stick.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the used part is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6. The length of the used part is 5/6 * 12 = 10 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the used part is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. The length of the used part is 1/3 * 12 = 4 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the used part is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. The length of the used part is 1/2 * 12 = 6 millimeters.

Now, let's calculate the total length of the used parts: 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks is 3 * 12 = 36 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 36 - 20 = 16 millimeters.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has and subtract it from the total cost of the car and phone.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and $200 from his brother, so he has a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

The total cost of the car and phone is $10000 + $800 = $10800.

To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

The final answer is: $5600"

"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount.

Craig initially has 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is 2 x $20 = $40.

He buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of squirt guns is 6 x $2 = $12.

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of water balloons is 3 x $3 = $9.

The total amount Craig spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Craig has $19 left.

The final answer is: $19"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack collected 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90 + 90 = 180."
"To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

We know that 5 students are good at math only. Let's denote the number of students good at both math and English as x.

The total number of students in the class is 20. The number of students good at English only is 8. So, the number of students good at both math and English is 20 - 5 - 8 = 7.

Therefore, the number of students good at math is 5 (good at math only) + 7 (good at both) = 12.

"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total available time for performances. 

The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. Subtracting the 10-minute intermission, we have 120 - 10 = 110 minutes available for performances.

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, the total time taken by each group is 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

Now, we can divide the total available time for performances (110 minutes) by the time taken by each group (10 minutes) to find out how many groups can perform:

110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

"Let's break down the information given:

1. You are three years younger than your brother.
2. You are 2 years older than your sister.
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age.
4. The sum of all your ages is 87.

Let's denote your age as 'x'. 

From point 1, your brother's age is x + 3. 
From point 2, your sister's age is x - 2. 
From point 3, your mom's age is 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 8.

Now, let's add all the ages together: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87
Combine like terms: 5x + 9 = 87

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78
Divide by 5: x = 15.6

Since age cannot be a decimal, we need to re-examine the equation. The error is likely due to the fact that we assumed the ages are whole numbers. Let's re-examine the equation: 5x + 9 = 87
Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78
Divide by 5: x = 15.6

However, since age cannot be a decimal, we need to re-examine the equation again. Let's try to find the closest whole number that satisfies the equation. We can round 15.6 to 16.

"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs, we first need to determine the total number of glue sticks required for the students. Since each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply the number of students by 2.

Total glue sticks needed = 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks needed by 8 to find out how many packs are required.

Number of packs needed = Total glue sticks needed / Number of glue sticks per pack
= 54 / 8
= 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at the given point over the three days.

Day 1: 4000 gallons
Day 2: 4000 * 2 = 8000 gallons
Day 3: 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is the sum of the water passing through each day.
Total = 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons

The final answer is: 24000"
"This problem can be modeled using exponential growth, where the number of infected people doubles every day. 

Day 1: 10 people are initially infected. After one day, each of the 10 people infects 6 others, resulting in a total of 10 + (10 * 6) = 10 + 60 = 70 people infected.

Day 2: The 70 people from Day 1 infect 6 others each, resulting in a total of 70 + (70 * 6) = 70 + 420 = 490 people infected.

Day 3: The 490 people from Day 2 infect 6 others each, resulting in a total of 490 + (490 * 6) = 490 + 2940 = 3430 people infected.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Claire earns 1 badge per month. 
Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), Claire will earn 1 * 12 = 12 badges.
Amber will earn 1/2 * 12 = 6 badges.
Wendy will earn 3 * 12 = 36 badges.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to determine the number of silver coins first. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and Gretchen has 70 gold coins, we can set up an equation to find the number of silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. 

The equation would be: x + (x + 30) = 70 (since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins)

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 70

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20

So, Gretchen has 20 silver coins. 

Now, to find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins: 70 (gold coins) + 20 (silver coins) = 90

The final answer is: 90"

"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first determine the number of green and blue cars. 

1. The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.
2. The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.
3. The total number of red, green, and blue cars is 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.
4. Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We know that S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
We also know that A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get S = (F - 12) + 25
S = F + 13

We also know that S + A + F = 85 (Together, they have 85 books)

Substituting the first equation into this equation, we get (F + 13) + A + F = 85
Combine like terms: 2F + A + 13 = 85

Substituting the second equation into this equation, we get 2F + (F - 12) + 13 = 85
Combine like terms: 3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides: 3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3: F = 28

"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them together.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5:
(60 * 2) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find the remaining pieces after the first two days, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26:
(26 * 7) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

Now, we add the pieces eaten on each day to find the total:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

For multiple-choice questions: 
Amy correctly answers 80% of 10 questions, so she answers 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correctly. 
Each question is worth 1 point, so she gets 8 * 1 = 8 points from multiple-choice questions.

For true/false questions: 
Amy correctly answers 90% of 20 questions, so she answers 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correctly. 
Each question is worth 1 point, so she gets 18 * 1 = 18 points from true/false questions.

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens, we can calculate this as follows:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since he plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each, the total revenue from selling these chickens will be:

180 * $50 = $9000

However, we are told that he needs to make a profit of $2000, which means the total revenue from selling the chickens should be $2000 more than the cost of the chickens. Let's denote the cost of the chickens as 'x'. Then, the total revenue is x + $2000.

Since the total revenue is $9000, we can set up the equation:

x + $2000 = $9000

Subtracting $2000 from both sides gives us:

x = $7000

So, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. 

Let's denote Melanie's current age as 'x'. In 10 years, she will be 18 years old. So, her current age 'x' plus 10 years will be 18. 

x + 10 = 18

Now, we can solve for 'x' by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation.

x = 18 - 10
x = 8

Now that we know Melanie's current age is 8, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. 

Let's denote the number of years as 'y'. In 'y' years, Melanie's age will be her current age 'x' plus 'y'. This age should be thrice her current age 'x'. 

x + y = 3x

We already know that x = 8. 

8 + y = 3 * 8
8 + y = 24

Now, we can solve for 'y' by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation.

y = 24 - 8
y = 16

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

The cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10.
The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 * 2 * $10 = $120, since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.
The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 * ($4 / 2) = $14, since each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.

The total cost of all the items is $10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from her budget: $65 - $156 = -$91.

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means that Kelly has overspent her budget by $91."
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts be x minutes. 

The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so its runtime is 2x minutes. 

At the end of the concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. 

The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, which is the sum of the runtime of the concert and the encore. 

We can write the equation: 2x + 15 = 65

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. 

Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 50 / 2
x = 25

The runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

"To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs. 

Let's assume the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is x. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the total number of microphones arranged in pairs is 2x.

However, we know that 20% of the total 50 microphones won't find any space to fit in. This means that 80% of the microphones will be arranged in pairs. 

We can set up the equation: 80% of 50 = 2x

To find 80% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.8: 
50 * 0.8 = 40

Now we have the equation: 40 = 2x

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
x = 40 / 2
x = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the number of flowering plants, we first need to find the number of indoor and outdoor plants.

One-fourth of the plants are indoor plants. 
Number of indoor plants = 100 * (1/4) = 25

The remaining plants are outdoor and flowering plants. 
Total remaining plants = 100 - 25 = 75

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. 
Number of outdoor plants = 75 * (2/3) = 50

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants. 
Number of flowering plants = 75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.
Percentage of flowering plants = (25/100) * 100 = 25%

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up an equation to find the speed of the thingamabob.

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x. Then, the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11x. We know that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, so we can set up the equation:

11x = 121

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 11:

x = 121 / 11
x = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob is 11 meters per second, we can find the speed of the whirligig. The whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob, so we can multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55

The final answer is: 55"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the price of one carrot as 'c'. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, the price of the yogurt is $6 / 2 = $3.

Ellen pays a total of $11 for her daily goods, which include 2 carrots, a salad, and a yogurt. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2c + 6 + 3 = 11

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:

2c + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable:

2c = 2

Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for 'c':

c = 1

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is 3x + x + 5x = 9x. 

We know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and since she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, she made a total of $6x from mowing lawns.

We are given that she made a total of $80 from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns. So, the amount she made from lemonade sales is $80 - $6x.

We are also given that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and since she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, we can set up the equation $6x + (80 - $6x) = $80.

Simplifying the equation, we get $80 - $6x + $6x = $80, which simplifies to $80 = $80.

However, this equation doesn't give us any information about the value of 'x'. We need to go back to the information that she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times.

Since she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times, we can set up the equation $6x + 3x * $6 + 5x * $6 = $80.

Simplifying the equation, we get $6x + $18x + $30x = $80, which simplifies to $54x = $80.

Dividing both sides by 54, we get x = $80 / 54 = 1.48 (approximately). However, since x must be a whole number (you can't mow a fraction of a lawn), we can try different values of x to see which one satisfies the equation.

Let's try x = 1. If x = 1, then she mowed Joe's lawn 1 time, Kamala's lawn 3 times, and Alba's lawn 5 times. In this case, she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, $18 from mowing Kamala's lawn, and $30 from mowing Alba's lawn, for a total of $54 from mowing lawns. This means she made $80 - $54 = $26 from lemonade sales.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"To find the total amount John earns from renting his car, we need to calculate the total hours he rents his car and multiply it by his hourly rate.

He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so the total hours he rents his car is 10 * 3 = 30 hours.

His hourly rate is $25, so the total amount he earns is 30 * $25 = $750.

However, he has a car payment of $500, so his profit is $750 - $500 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Martha initially had some notebooks, but we don't know the exact number. However, we know that after buying 5 more, she had a total of 7 notebooks. This means she initially had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, and Martha initially had 2 notebooks, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. So, Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we first need to find the distance rowed by Anis. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find 1/5 of Dijana's distance, we multiply 50 by 1/5. 

50 * 1/5 = 10

So, Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana. To find the total distance rowed by Anis, we add 10 to Dijana's distance.

Anis' distance = 50 + 10 = 60 miles

Now, we add the distances rowed by both Dijana and Anis to find the total distance.

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110 miles

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we first need to determine the total number of cookies left after Susan's husband took some. 

Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies, so we subtract 4 from 100: 100 - 4 = 96 cookies.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. 

To divide 96 cookies by 6, we perform the division: 96 ÷ 6 = 16.

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies."
"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today.

So, Denise read a total of 10 + 18 = 28 pages, and Daniel read a total of 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the number of pages Daniel read from the number of pages Denise read: 28 - 13 = 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bowls of soup will be used for dinner and then calculate how many bowls of soup will be left over. 

For dinner, there are 4 adults and 2 children, so a total of 6 people. Each person will eat one bowl, so 6 bowls will be used for dinner.

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, we can assume that the pot can fill 8 bowls in total (since 4 adult bowls = 8 child bowls). 

Now, we subtract the 6 bowls used for dinner from the total capacity of the pot: 8 - 6 = 2 bowls.

Since there are 2 children, and there are 2 bowls of soup left, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 / 2 = 1 time.

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total amount of material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks: 
- Each small mask requires 2 yards of material.
- Jo needs to make 20 small masks.
- Total material required for small masks = 20 * 2 = 40 yards.

For large masks: 
- Each large mask requires 2.25 yards of material.
- Jo needs to make 8 large masks.
- Total material required for large masks = 8 * 2.25 = 18 yards.

Total material required = material for small masks + material for large masks = 40 + 18 = 58 yards.

"To find out how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total time he spends on activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day (24 hours).

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. 
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours a day.
He walks his dog for 1 hour a day.

Total time spent on activities = 10 (sleep) + 8 (work) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours

Free time = Total hours in a day - Total time spent on activities

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write an equation:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2x

We know that Duncan's current age is 60, so we can find his age eight years ago by subtracting 8 from 60:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 60 - 8
Duncan's age eight years ago = 52

Now we can equate this to 2x:

52 = 2x

To find x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 52 / 2
x = 26

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to x:

Adam's current age = x + 4
Adam's current age = 26 + 4
Adam's current age = 30

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = Adam's current age + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku and then divide it by the time it takes to drink one bottle of water.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so an extreme sudoku takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to convert the time it takes to solve the extreme sudoku to half hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 180 minutes is equal to 180 / 30 = 6 half hours.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, he drinks 6 bottles of water in 6 half hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Lana has 27 cups in total and divides them into 3 rows. 
   To find out how many cups are in each row, we divide 27 by 3:

2. Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row will be half of the total cups in each row.
   9 / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea in each row.

However, since we can't have a fraction of a cup, we can assume that Lana must have made a whole number of cups of mint tea in each row. This means that the 4.5 cups of mint tea in each row must be rounded down to 4 cups of mint tea in each row, as she can't make a fraction of a cup.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick per trip. 

Let's break down the problem: 

- The sloth has 8 hours to collect 24 berries.
- Each trip down, up, and back takes 4 hours, so the sloth can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips in 8 hours.
- Since the sloth picks the same number of berries on each trip, let's call the number of berries picked per trip 'x'.
- The total number of berries picked in 2 trips is 2x.
- We want to find the minimum value of 'x' such that 2x = 24.

To find the minimum value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

2x = 24
x = 24 / 2
x = 12

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12.

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age.

Let's denote John's age as x. Then Paul's age is x + 10.

Since Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, Peter's age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10.

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old, so we can write the equation: (2x + 10) + (x + 10) + Jean's age = 100.

However, we don't have any information about Jean's age. But we can still solve for x by assuming Jean's age is 'y'. So the equation becomes (2x + 10) + (x + 10) + y = 100.

Combine like terms: 3x + 20 + y = 100.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 3x + y = 80.

However, we still don't have enough information to solve for x. We need more information about Jean's age or a relationship between x and y.

But let's re-examine the information given. We know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, and Paul is 10 years older than John. This means that Peter's age is equal to the sum of John's age and 10 more than John's age. This is the same as saying Peter's age is 2 times John's age.

So, we can write the equation: Peter's age = 2x.

We also know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. Since Peter's age is 2x, Paul's age is x + 10, and Jean's age is y, we can write the equation: 2x + (x + 10) + y = 100.

Combine like terms: 3x + 10 + y = 100.

Subtract 10 from both sides: 3x + y = 90.

Now we have two equations: 3x + y = 90 and 3x + y = 80. These two equations are the same, which means we have a contradiction. This means that the information given is inconsistent, and there is no solution for x.

However, if we assume that the information given is consistent, we can solve for x. Subtract the second equation from the first equation: (3x + y) - (3x + y) = 90 - 80.

This simplifies to 0 = 10, which is a contradiction. This means that the information given is inconsistent, and there is no solution for x.

However, if we assume that the information given is consistent, we can solve for x. Subtract the second equation from the first equation: (3x + y) - (3x + y) = 90 - 80.

"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria had 1 balloon, and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each. So, the total initial number of balloons is:
1 (Maria's balloon) + (4 x 2) = 1 + 8 = 9

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (including Maria), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 x 3 = 15

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many tables they need, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so they have 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. 
They already have 10 boxes, so in total, they have 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

They can fit 2 boxes per table, and they already have 15 tables. To find out how many more tables they need, we need to divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes per table and subtract the number of tables they already have.

60 boxes / 2 boxes per table = 30 tables needed in total
30 tables needed - 15 tables already owned = 15 tables needed

"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then divide it by the number of seeds they spat.

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both of them is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

They spat a total of 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

The average total distance spat is 820 / 75 = 10.93 (rounded to two decimal places).

Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing the option of adding 70 pesos for every additional hour."
"To find out how much hay each sheep needs, we need to calculate twice the amount each goat needs and then subtract 3 pounds. 

Twice the amount each goat needs is 2 * 5 = 10 pounds. 
Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than that, so each sheep needs 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately. 

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds.
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds.

To find the total amount of hay needed, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, we need to find the time it took James to swim 60% of the distance. 
   Distance = 20 miles, 
   Speed = 2 miles per hour, 
   Time = Distance / Speed = 20 / 2 = 10 hours.
   60% of the distance is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.
   Time taken to swim 12 miles = 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

2. Now, James rests for half the time he spent swimming. 
   Rest time = 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

3. The remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. 
   James swims at half the speed, so his new speed is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.
   Time taken to swim the remaining distance = 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

4. Total time taken = Time taken to swim 12 miles + Rest time + Time taken to swim the remaining distance = 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. So, we can write the equation: x + (x - 10) + (x + 10) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3x = 45.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 15.

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find out how many points Azibo scored: Azibo scored x - 10 = 15 - 10 = 5 points.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is 100 pages to the inch and each paper is printed on both sides, we have 200 pages per inch (100 pages per side).

The book is 1.5 inches thick, so we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:

200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked. He worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know he staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the number of reports he staples per minute, we divide 30 by 15.

30 reports / 15 minutes = 2 reports per minute

Now, we multiply the total number of minutes he worked by the number of reports he staples per minute.

900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up earlier.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she usually sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. This means she slept for 5:55 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 7 hours and 55 minutes. Converting this to minutes, we get 7 * 60 + 55 = 455 minutes.

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total sleep time, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up earlier from her usual sleep time: 480 - 23 - 25 = 432 minutes.

The final answer is: 432"
"To find the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially, we need to first find out how many measuring cups he has. Since he has two dozen cups, we multiply 2 by 12 to get the total number of cups.

2 * 12 = 24 cups

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we multiply the number of cups by 2/3 to find the number of spoons.

24 * (2/3) = 16 spoons

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, we subtract 6 from the total number of spoons to find the remaining number of spoons.

16 - 6 = 10 spoons

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the remaining spoons and the number of cups.

24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the number of occupied beds initially, we need to calculate 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital.

Total capacity = 1000 beds
Occupied beds initially = 1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to find the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is equal to 14 days.

Total patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

Now, we need to find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks. We add the initial occupied beds to the total patients admitted.

Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = 200 beds + 700 patients = 900 beds

Since the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, we can find the number of unoccupied beds by subtracting the total occupied beds from the total capacity.

Total unoccupied beds = 1000 beds - 900 beds = 100 beds

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to first find out how many emails are not work-related. 

Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. So, 6 emails are to family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after subtracting the work and family emails. 9 (non-work emails) - 6 (family emails) = 3.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find Shawna's age, we need to multiply Aliya's age by 3 since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. 

Aliya's age = 3 years
Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we can multiply Shawna's age by 5 to find her father's age.

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age = 5 * 9 = 45 years

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from the number she reported.

Let's assume the number Courtney reported is 100%. 
20% of 48 is 0.2 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48 to find the actual number of people who attended the concert.
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4."
"To find the total number of balls, we need to determine how many balls each boy carried and add them up. 

Since Jason carried 2 balls, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey must have carried half of what Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan must have carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day, we need to add the holes dug each day and subtract the two holes filled in. 

Holes dug on the first day = 10
Holes dug on the second day = 13
Holes dug on the third day = 8
Holes filled in on the third day = 2

Total holes by the end of the third day = 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since the island had 10 holes at the end of the first day, it had 4 * 10 = 40 holes by the end of the fourth day.

To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total holes by the end of the third day from the total holes by the end of the fourth day.

Holes dug on the fourth day = Total holes by the end of the fourth day - Total holes by the end of the third day
= 40 - 29
= 11

The pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure."
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 15 more than each of them. 

Since the third person got 15 more than Amora and Lainey, the third person got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips each person got. So, the total number of corn chips is 70 (Amora) + 70 (Lainey) + 85 (Collins) = 225.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, let's find 50% of the cost of supplies. 
50% of $400 = 0.5 * $400 = $200

Now, we add this to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel.
Cost of travel = Cost of supplies + 50% of cost of supplies
Cost of travel = $400 + $200
Cost of travel = $600

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L. 

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so A + S + L = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so L = S + 5.

We also know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so S = 4A - 13.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one: A + (S + 5) + S = 339.

This simplifies to A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Now we can substitute the third equation into this one: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.

This simplifies to A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.

Combine like terms: 9A - 21 = 339.

Add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Divide by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to find half of the number of minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, there are 20 minutes per episode. Half of 20 is 10. 

So, there are 10 episodes in total. 

To find the total time spent watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Then, let's calculate the distance traveled in the northerly direction:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled in the final southerly direction:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

The total distance traveled in the southerly direction is the sum of the first and third distances:
Total southerly distance = 300 miles + 110 miles
Total southerly distance = 410 miles

The distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is the total southerly distance minus the distance traveled in the northerly direction:
Distance between homes = Total southerly distance - Northerly distance
Distance between homes = 410 miles - 36 miles
Distance between homes = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"

Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies. 
She received 1/2 dozen brownies from her office, which is 6 brownies. 
She received 4 dozen brownies from her friends, which is 48 brownies.

Total brownies received = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66

1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Total brownies left over = Total brownies received - Total brownies eaten
= 66 - 18

"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we need to multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form).

Nani's sister's age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together: 8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we first need to find the number of players in Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players in Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

Number of players in Zeke's team = 13 + 7 = 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams, we add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team.

Total number of players = 20 (Zeke's team) + 13 (Carlton's team) = 33

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2 * (length + width). 

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10) 
Perimeter = 2 * 25 
Perimeter = 50 feet

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first determine how many boxes she had left after giving some to her mom and sister. 

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so she gave away a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.

Now, she had 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left.

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges in 8 boxes is 8 * 20 = 160 oranges.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges. 

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

"To find the total number of states in both countries together, we first need to find the number of states in the USA and India.

The USA has 50 states.

Let's assume the number of states in India is x. According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, we can write the equation as:

x = (50 / 2) + 4
x = 25 + 4
x = 29

Now, we know that India has 29 states.

To find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in the USA and India:

Total number of states = 50 (USA) + 29 (India)
Total number of states = 79

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is the sum of the cost of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook. 
Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn. 
Amount needed to earn = Total cost - Amount saved = $39 - $14 = $25

Now, we can find out how many hours Tyler needs to work by dividing the amount he needs to earn by his hourly wage. 
Hours to work = Amount needed to earn / Hourly wage = $25 / $5 = 5

"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we first need to determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can set up the equation:

Robert's cherries = Richard's cherries + 10
30 = Richard's cherries + 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has. Since the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 and 20 cherries respectively, we can find Jerry's cherries by subtracting their total from the total number of cherries:

Total cherries = Robert's cherries + Richard's cherries + Jerry's cherries
60 = 30 + 20 + Jerry's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 30 - 20
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 20

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on both days and then calculate the total earnings.

Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.

We know that on Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so G = 10.

We also know that on Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, and on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. So, A = 15 - 4 = 11.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for both days.

The total earnings from gingerbread on Saturday is 10 * $6 = $60.
The total earnings from apple pie on Saturday is 11 * $15 = $165.
The total earnings from gingerbread on Sunday is 15 * $6 = $90.
The total earnings from apple pie on Sunday is 15 * $15 = $225.

The total earnings for both days is $60 + $165 + $90 + $225 = $480.

"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use.

Pamela reapplies sunscreen every hour, and she will be outside for 4 hours a day. So, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day. 

Since she will be on vacation for 8 days, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day for 8 days, which is 4 * 8 = 32 times.

Each bottle of sunscreen is 8 ounces, and she uses 1 ounce each time she reapplies. So, she will need 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.

To find out how many bottles she will need, we divide the total amount of sunscreen needed (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces).

32 ounces / 8 ounces per bottle = 4 bottles

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is 19 years old now.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

From point 3, we can deduce that Emil's brother is currently half of Emil's age when Emil turns 24. Since Emil is 19 now, when he turns 24, he will be 24 - 19 = 5 years older. Therefore, his brother's age when Emil turns 24 will be 5 / 2 = 2.5 years. 

Since Emil's brother is 2.5 years old when Emil turns 24, we can find his current age by subtracting 5 from 2.5, which is 2.5 - 5 = -2.5. However, this is not possible as age cannot be negative. This means that the information given is inconsistent or there is an error in the problem.

However, if we assume that the problem is asking for the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother when Emil turns 24, we can proceed as follows:

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means his dad's age when Emil turns 24 will be 24 * 2 = 48.

Since Emil's brother is twice as old as Emil when Emil turns 24, his brother's age when Emil turns 24 will be 24 * 2 = 48.

Now, we know that Emil's dad is 48 when Emil is 24, and Emil's brother is also 48 when Emil is 24. However, this is not the current age of Emil's dad and brother. To find their current ages, we need to subtract 5 from 48 for both of them, as Emil is 5 years younger than his dad and brother when he turns 24.

So, Emil's dad's current age is 48 - 5 = 43, and his brother's current age is 48 - 5 = 43.

The sum of their ages is 43 + 43 = 86.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by 3: 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to first convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches, since the width of the plants is given in inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches
111 feet = 111 * 12 = 1332 inches

Now, we need to subtract the space between the plants. Since there are 17 plants, there will be 16 spaces between them. The total space between the plants is 16 * 1.5 = 24 feet. We need to convert this to inches as well.

24 feet = 24 * 12 = 288 inches

Now, we subtract the total space between the plants from the total length of the flower bed in inches.

1332 - 288 = 1044 inches

Now, we need to find out how many plants can fit in this space. We know that each plant takes up 12 inches, so we divide the total space by the space taken up by each plant.

1044 / 12 = 87

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so we need to subtract this from the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed.

87 - 17 = 70

Now, we need to find out how much money Pat will spend at the store to buy the remaining plants. Each plant costs $6, so we multiply the number of plants Pat needs to buy by the cost of each plant.

$500.00 x 12 = $6,000.00

Since each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, we need to divide the total amount she sets aside in a year by the cost of each pair of shoes.
$6,000.00 ÷ $1,000.00 = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: peeling and cooking. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to cook 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 30 * 10 = 30 minutes.

However, since these tasks are not done sequentially, but simultaneously, we need to add the time it takes to peel and cook the shrimp. So, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 15 + 30 = 45 minutes.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

2. Then, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

3. The total cooling effect after 7 hours (3 hours on low + 4 hours on high) is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

4. After the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room warmed up by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total warming effect in 2 hours is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

5. The net cooling effect after 9 hours (7 hours with the air conditioner on + 2 hours with it off) is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. 

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
2. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. 
   Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.
3. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the time between Bill's two sightings of the comet is 75 years.
4. To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to subtract 75 from his age at the second sighting.
   Bill's age at the second sighting = 90 years
   Bill's age at the first sighting = 90 - 75 = 15 years

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and add them together.

1. Electric bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
2. Gas bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
3. Church: 2 checks per month, so 24 checks per year.
4. Pest and lawn service: 1 check every 3 months, so 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add the total number of checks:
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 flights per day.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is (3/4) * 88 = 66 flights. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France and Germany is (1/2) * (88 - 66) = 11.

Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, Adam had to contribute $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know that the total age of the children is 20 and there are 4 children. 

Let's denote the sum of the ages of the children as S and the average age as A. 

S = A * 4 (since there are 4 children)

We know that S = 20. 

20 = A * 4

To find A, we divide both sides by 4:

A = 20 / 4
A = 5

Now that we know the average age of the group is 5, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. 

Helene's age = 2 * A
Helene's age = 2 * 5
Helene's age = 10

We know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. 

The sum of their ages is 3 + 4 = 7.

The total age of the group is 20, and we know the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene. 

The age of Wilfred = Total age of the group - (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age)
The age of Wilfred = 20 - (3 + 4 + 10)
The age of Wilfred = 20 - 17
The age of Wilfred = 3

"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected by Walter before his friend donates $200. 

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's friend donates $200, but this is not included in the amount that Walter will tell his lawyer about. The amount Walter will tell his lawyer about is $2000.

Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. So, the amount Walter's lawyer will contribute is 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to first find out the total number of cookies. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

Since the bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church, the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 * 1/2 = 750.

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got. 

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Number of cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's assume the total watermelon is 100 units. 

Let's say each kid gets x units of watermelon. Since each adult gets twice as much as each kid, each adult gets 2x units.

The total amount of watermelon given to the kids is 4x (since there are 4 kids), and the total amount given to the adults is 2x + 2x = 4x (since there are 2 adults).

The total amount of watermelon given to the family is 4x + 4x = 8x.

Since the total watermelon is 100 units, we can set up the equation 8x = 100.

To find x, we divide both sides by 8: x = 100 / 8 = 12.5.

Now that we know x, we can find the amount of watermelon each adult gets: 2x = 2 * 12.5 = 25.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we divide the amount each adult gets by the total watermelon and multiply by 100: (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much time Doctor Jones will spend on rounds, we need to multiply the number of inpatients by the time spent per inpatient. 

9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

To find out how much time Doctor Jones will spend on appointments, we need to multiply the number of appointments by the time spent per appointment.

10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Converting 300 minutes to hours:

300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

Now, we need to add the time spent on rounds and appointments to find the total time spent at the clinic.

3 hours (rounds) + 5 hours (appointments) = 8 hours

Since Doctor Jones is working 9 hours at the clinic, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours worked to find the time left for updating records.

9 hours (total hours) - 8 hours (time spent) = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:
180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Jordan needs 3 hours to make the cake. To be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm, she should start making the cake at 2:00 pm.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. The total number of boxes sold is 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together and they sold 8 boxes, we can find the number of chocolate bars in a box by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes.

Number of chocolate bars in a box = Total number of chocolate bars / Total number of boxes
= 64 / 8
= 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. So, the number of sessions in a month is 3 sessions/day * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

The total cost per session is $40, and there are 12 sessions in a month. So, the total cost per month is $40 * 12 = $480.

The dance studio earns the same amount as it costs to rent the studio and pay the students, so the expected earnings in a month are also $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter: 64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha:
16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5. 

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of babies born in a month is 30 * 4 = 120.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the initial population plus the number of babies born in a year. 

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the number of gallons of water needed, we do this next:

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:

Cost = Gallons * $0.10
Cost = 8260 * $0.10
Cost = $826

The final answer is: $826"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to find the number of blue and yellow sticks first. 

We know there are 9 red sticks. 
There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.
The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 
9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34

"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. 

Since Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

So, on the first day, the total amount of water in the tank is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. 

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

So, on the second day, the total amount of water in the tank is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water in the tank after two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons, the remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x%.

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is x - 5 * 9 = x - 45%.

In the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining is (x - 45) - 3 * 7 = x - 45 - 21 = x - 66%.

We are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. We can set up the equation:

x - 66 = 28

To solve for x, we add 66 to both sides of the equation:

x = 28 + 66
x = 94

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%.

The final answer is: 94"
"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work, we first need to calculate her total weekly income. 

Her hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25 per hour. 
Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly income is 40 * $25 = $1000.

Next, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. 20% of $10000 is 0.2 * $10000 = $2000.

Now, we can divide the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly income ($1000) to find out how many weeks she needs to work: $2000 / $1000 = 2.

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate how much money he has left after purchasing the other fruits. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he has already purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. Since she kept 2 packs for herself, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Next, we need to find out how many packs each friend received. Since there are 10 friends, we divide the total number of packs given away (13) by the number of friends (10). 

13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend.

Since each pack has 60 pieces, we multiply the number of packs each friend received by the number of pieces in each pack.

1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces.

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8.

Total pictures = 72
Pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
Pictures per album = 72 / 8
Pictures per album = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits, the remaining 3 albums must be a mix of both selfies and portraits. However, we are not given any information about the mix of selfies and portraits in these 3 albums. 

But we can still find the total number of selfies and portraits. Since 3 albums were selfies only, the total number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27. Similarly, 2 albums were portraits only, so the total number of portraits is 2 * 9 = 18.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 'x' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'y'.
2. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation: x = 2y.
3. We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one, which is $12.
4. The total earnings from the sales are $120, which is the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals. We can write an equation: 4x + 12y = 120.
5. Since x = 2y (from step 2), we can substitute this into the equation from step 4: 4(2y) + 12y = 120.
6. Simplifying the equation, we get: 8y + 12y = 120, which is 20y = 120.
7. To find the value of y, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: y = 120 / 20 = 6.
8. Since x = 2y (from step 2), we can find the value of x by multiplying y by 2: x = 2 * 6 = 12.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 2 * 12 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Next, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. Since he can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. Since one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days with steel pickaxes. Since they can mine 1440 pounds of ore per day, they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore in 30 days.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

For the first package, the price is $3 and the number of sandwiches is 2. 
For the second package, the price is $6 and the number of sandwiches is 4.

We can set up a ratio of price to number of sandwiches for the first two packages:

$3 / 2 = $6 / 4

To simplify the ratio, we can divide both sides by 2:

$3 / 2 = $3 / 2

Now we can see that the ratio of price to number of sandwiches is $3 per 2 sandwiches. 

Since the price is proportional, we can multiply the number of sandwiches in the third package (8) by the ratio of price to number of sandwiches ($3 per 2 sandwiches):

8 * ($3 / 2) = $3 * 4 = $12

The package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to first calculate how much he still owes after selling his old bedroom set. 

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom set: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we need to calculate 10% of $2000.

10% of $2000 = 0.1 x $2000 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

1. 40% of the red balloons burst: 
   Number of red balloons that burst = 40% of 25 = 0.4 * 25 = 10
   Number of red balloons remaining = 25 - 10 = 15

2. Half of the yellow balloons were released:
   Number of yellow balloons released = 50% of 12 = 0.5 * 12 = 6
   Number of yellow balloons remaining = 12 - 6 = 6

3. 75% of the blue balloons were added:
   Number of blue balloons added = 75% of 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6
   Total number of balloons now = 15 (red) + 7 (green) + 6 (yellow) + 6 (blue) = 34

Therefore, Sally carried 34 balloons into the school."
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability of the complement of the event that he won't have to turn it in. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). 

However, the last scenario is dependent on the first two not happening. So, we need to find the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not convincing her, which is 60% (100% - 40%) * 80% (100% - 20%). 

Now, we can find the total probability of the first two scenarios happening: 50% + 40% = 90%. 

The probability of the last scenario is 60% * 20% = 12%. 

Now, we add the probabilities of the first two scenarios and the last scenario: 90% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since probabilities cannot exceed 100%.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we need to first calculate the total number of available seats for guests. 

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950

"To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the number of small beans and the number of large beans. 

First, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. This means that 1 small bean is equivalent to 1/3 of a medium-sized bean.

Since Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is 2 times the number of large beans. 

Let's denote the number of large beans as L. Then, the number of medium-sized beans is 2L.

We know that 1 small bean is equivalent to 1/3 of a medium-sized bean. So, the number of small beans is 3 times the number of medium-sized beans. 

The number of small beans = 3 * (2L) = 6L.

We also know that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up. So, L = 75.

Now, we can find the number of small beans: 
Number of small beans = 6L = 6 * 75 = 450.

Next, we need to find out how many packs he can make with 80 apples. Since each pack has 8 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack.

Number of packs = Total apples / apples per pack = 80 / 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor starts with $50, so subtracting the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount of money, we get:
$50 - $40 = $10.

Therefore, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and lost income while in school. 

The total amount of loans he took is 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000.

The amount of money he lost due to not working while in school is 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000.

The total amount of money he lost is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After graduating, his income triples to $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

To find out how long it will take him to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we can use the formula:

Time = Total Amount / Annual Income

Time = $300,000 / $75,000/year

Time = 4 years

However, this is the time it would take to pay off the loans and lost income if he didn't take any breaks or interest on the loans. In reality, he would have to pay interest on the loans, which would increase the total amount he needs to pay. 

Assuming an average interest rate of 4% per year, the total amount he needs to pay would be:

$300,000 (initial amount) * (1 + 0.04)^4 (4 years) = $360,000

Time = $360,000 / $75,000/year

Time = 4.8 years

So, it would take Jim approximately 4.8 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, considering the interest on the loans.

The final answer is: 4.8"
"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, so the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of one piece of fabric is length * width, so it is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, he needs 2 * 80 = 160 square feet of fabric.

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 
So, they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters on Wednesday.

Now, let's add up the number of letters delivered each day: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

"To find the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities per country and then multiply that by the population of each city.

Number of countries: 26
Number of cities per country: 5
Population per city: 1000

First, multiply the number of countries by the number of cities per country: 26 * 5 = 130

The final answer is: 130000"
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to first calculate their current heights.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet, which is equal to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole's initial height was 50 inches and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the share of the first person as x. 

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

The final answer is: $420"
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

First, let's convert 3 weeks to days: 3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to find the fraction of a day in hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 of a day is (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2010.

The car was bought in 2007, so we need to calculate the depreciation for 3 years (2008, 2009, and 2010).

The initial price of the car is $20,000.

The depreciation rate is 21% per year.

To calculate the depreciation for each year, we can use the formula:

Price after depreciation = Initial price * (1 - depreciation rate)

For 2008:
Price after depreciation = $20,000 * (1 - 0.21) = $20,000 * 0.79 = $15,800

For 2009:
Price after depreciation = $15,800 * (1 - 0.21) = $15,800 * 0.79 = $12,502

For 2010:
Price after depreciation = $12,502 * (1 - 0.21) = $12,502 * 0.79 = $9,900.18

So, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,900.18."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to find the total number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

10% of the books are written in German, so that's 10% of 50, which is 0.1 x 50 = 5 books in German.

The total number of books written in English and German is 25 + 5 = 30.

Since there are 50 books in total, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate how many cups of water she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. 
So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can find out how many gallons by dividing the total cups by 16. 
240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons.

"To find the total amount Alison spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55

"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since a twin bed has 1 set of sheets and a king size bed has 1 set of sheets, the total number of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 + 1 = 5.

Since a twin set of sheets is washed at a time, and there are 4 twin beds, he needs to wash 4 sets of twin sheets. Additionally, he needs to wash 1 king set of sheets. So, in total, he needs to wash 4 + 1 = 5 sets of sheets every week.

Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, he needs to wash the 4 twin sets of sheets in 2 loads (2 sets of twin sheets per load) and 1 king set of sheets in 1 load. So, in total, he needs to do 2 + 1 = 3 loads of laundry every week.

To find out how many loads of laundry he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads he does in a week by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so he does 3 * 52 = 156 loads of laundry in a year.

First, let's calculate the total amount of cat food Imma feeds her cats per day: 60 grams * 2 = 120 grams.

Now, let's divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the daily amount (120 grams): 720 / 120 = 6.

The cat food will last for 6 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate. 

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, we know that Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. 

To find the total number of slices they ate, we add these numbers together: 10 + 7 + 14 = 31.

"Let's denote Donovan's part as D and Betsy's part as B. We know that B = D + 18. We also know that the total time taken is 98 minutes, so D + B = 98. 

Substituting B = D + 18 into the second equation, we get D + (D + 18) = 98. Simplifying this, we get 2D + 18 = 98. Subtracting 18 from both sides, we get 2D = 80. Dividing both sides by 2, we get D = 40.

Now that we know Donovan's part took 40 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to D. B = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58.

"To find the total number of pizzas left, we first need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 
They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 (by the glee club) + 32 (by the football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 (by the glee club) + 40 (by the football team) = 60 pizzas.

The number of pizzas left is 60 (total pizzas) - 46 (pizzas eaten) = 14 pizzas.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

He also wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, which is 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

"To find the total cost of the butter, we first need to determine how much Dennis needs to buy. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen, he needs 6 pounds of butter.

Since the store has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half off, we can calculate the cost as follows:

- For the first pound, the cost is $4.00.
- For the second pound, the cost is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00 (since it's half off).

For the remaining 4 pounds, the same promotion applies, so the cost will be:
- 2 pounds at $4.00 each = $8.00
- 2 pounds at $2.00 each = $4.00

The total cost for the remaining 4 pounds is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Adding the cost of the first two pounds, the total cost is $4.00 + $2.00 + $12.00 = $18.00.

Total guests = 25 + 7 + 13 - 4 = 41

Since the initial fee is for 20 guests, we need to find the number of additional guests. 

Additional guests = Total guests - 20 = 41 - 20 = 21

Now, we can calculate the cost of the additional guests. 

Cost of additional guests = 21 * $6 = $126

The total cost of the party is the initial rental fee plus the cost of the additional guests.

Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60. To find this, we multiply 60 by 1/3: 
60 * (1/3) = 60 * 0.33 = 20

Now, we know that Maggie spent $15 and Riza spent $20. To find out how much money they have left, we need to subtract the money they spent from the initial amount they had. 

Maggie's remaining money: 60 - 15 = 45

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat each day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. 

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys in total, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats. However, we know that the total number of bananas is 315 and they last for a week, which is 7 days. 

So, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315 * 7 = 2205 bananas.

Since the first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day, the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day is (2205 - 24 * 7) / 7.

First, calculate 24 * 7 = 168. 

Then, subtract 168 from 2205: 2205 - 168 = 2037.

Now, divide 2037 by 7: 2037 / 7 = 291.

The cost of 3 individual roses is 3 * $2 = $6.
The total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she paid with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station. Since the first train leaves at 30 minutes, the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.

3. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

4. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station. Since the second train leaves at 65 minutes, the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes.

5. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

6. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. Since the third train leaves at 125 minutes, the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

7. Paul will board the fourth train, which arrives at 145 minutes. Since he is waiting at the station from the beginning, he will wait for 145 - 0 = 145 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to first calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved. 

Melanie saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. 
So, the total number of toothpicks she saved is 10 * 12 = 120.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total, and she already has 120, she needs 200 - 120 = 80 more toothpicks.

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week. To find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks, we divide 80 by 10. 
80 / 10 = 8.

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and then the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is:

2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so the price his friend paid is:

1500 * 1.20 = $1800

To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price he paid, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100:

Discount = ((Original Price - Price Paid) / Original Price) * 100
= ((2000 - 1800) / 2000) * 100

"To find the total distance James walked, we need to calculate the round trip distance. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back home, the total distance is 2 * 4 miles = 8 miles.

Since James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the total time it took him to walk the round trip.

Time = distance / speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

However, this is the total time for the round trip. We need to find the time it took him to reach the store initially. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back, the time it took him to reach the store initially is half of the total time.

Time to reach the store = Total time / 2
Time to reach the store = 2 hours / 2
Time to reach the store = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and compare it to the cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

If Jenny bought the bananas individually, the cost would be: 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Since Jenny bought the bananas in bunches, the cost would be: 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sam gets x feet of the fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. To find out how much is left over, we need to subtract the total amount of fence Sam and Harry got from the total length of the fence:

100 - (20 + (20 + 60)) = 100 - 100 = 0

However, this is not the correct interpretation of the question. The question asks how much is left over for Sam, but it seems to be asking how much is left over in total, not how much is left over for Sam specifically. If we interpret the question as asking how much is left over for Sam, then the answer would be 0, since Sam got 20 feet of the fence.

However, if we interpret the question as asking how much is left over in total, then the answer would be 0, since Sam and Harry together got 100 feet of the fence.

But if we interpret the question as asking how much is left over for Sam after Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, then we can say that Sam got 20 feet and Harry got 80 feet, and the total amount of fence used is 100 feet. In this case, the amount of fence left over is 0.

However, if we interpret the question as asking how much is left over for Sam after Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, and we assume that the remaining amount of fence is not used, then we can say that the amount of fence left over is 0.

"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the growth in inches by the number of years. 

Growth per year = 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply the growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth = 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

Let's break down the information:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the total earnings from all types of bikes:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find the total number of bales made by the farmer, we multiply the number of bales made per hour by the number of hours worked. 

Farmer's bales = 5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales

To find the total number of bales picked up by the truck, we multiply the number of bales picked up per hour by the number of hours worked.

Truck's bales = 3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales

To find the total number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the total number of bales made by the farmer.

Bales left in the field = Farmer's bales - Truck's bales = 30 - 18 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we first need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class per day. 

There are 6 periods in a day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes per day is 6 * 40 = 240 minutes.

Since John goes to class for 5 days a week, the total minutes he spends in class per week is 240 * 5 = 1200 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. 1/16 of his weekly minutes is spent on these days. His total weekly minutes are 1200 (in class) + 240 (Saturday) + 240 (Sunday) = 1680 minutes. 

1/16 of 1680 is 1680 / 16 = 105 minutes.

So, the total minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday is 105 minutes.

Now, we add the minutes he spends in class and the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. 1200 + 105 = 1305 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 1305 / 60 = 21.75 hours.

The final answer is: 21.75"
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet.

The height of the ball after the first bounce is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

The height of the ball after the second bounce is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to convert the height of the first child to inches and then calculate the height of each child step by step.

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10).

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"To find the original weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the 270 kilograms left after the Allosaurus ate. 

First, the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which was half of what the velociraptors had. So, the velociraptors had 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms.

Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex, the T-Rex must have eaten half of the original weight of the triceratops. The velociraptors had 540 kilograms, which is half of what the T-Rex ate. So, the T-Rex ate 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the original weight of the triceratops was 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To find the total area to be painted, we need to calculate the area of all four walls. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet. 

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet.

The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the total number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so 9 were unshaken. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken and 3 shaken sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

The total number of sodas left is 2 (shaken) + 6 (unshaken) = 8.

The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans: 2/8 = 0.25.

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add their distances together to find the total distance between them. 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of days Billy helps, we first need to calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

However, Billy takes 20% of these days off. 20% of 50 is 0.2 * 50 = 10. So, he takes 10 days off.

The number of days he helps is 50 - 10 = 40.

Since Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

The total number of people he helps is 40 * 6 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people who were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people who attended the wedding.

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses:
12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars:
20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the total number of people who attended the wedding is the sum of the people inside the church and the people outside, we can assume that the number of people outside the church is the sum of the number of cars and buses, which is 20 + 12 = 32 people.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people who attended the wedding:
480 people (transported) + 32 people (outside) = 512 people

However, this is the total number of people who attended the wedding, not the number of people inside the church. To find the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the number of people outside the church from the total number of people who attended the wedding. However, the question does not provide the number of people outside the church. 

However, we can assume that the question is asking for the number of people inside the church after the ceremony. In that case, the number of people outside the church would be the number of people who were waiting for the ceremony to end, which is the number of people who were not transported by the buses and cars. 

Since each bus carried 35 people and each car carried 3 people, the total number of people transported is 420 + 60 = 480. The number of people who were not transported is the total number of people who attended the wedding minus the number of people transported, which is 512 - 480 = 32 people.

So, the number of people inside the church is the total number of people who attended the wedding minus the number of people who were not transported:
512 people - 32 people = 480 people

The final answer is: 480"
"To find Jeff's age, we need to first find Martha's age. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age. Since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, we can calculate Jeff's age by adding 10 to Martha's age.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of each slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time = 3 minutes

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the two slides:
Difference = Time for the biggest slide - Time for the second biggest slide
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference = 2 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total time spent on lunches and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. 
Total time spent per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 2 x 15 minutes (breaks) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Now, we multiply the time spent per day by 5 to find the total time spent in 5 days.
1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

The total time spent on lunches and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours."
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total miles run by all three is 52. We can subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after returning the $15.00 item and then add that to the initial charge.

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. Return: -$15.00 (since she returned an item)
   New balance: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

3. Frying pan: 20% off $20.00
   Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
   Price of frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00
   New balance: $70.00 + $16.00 = $86.00

4. Towels: 10% off $30.00
   Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
   Price of towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00
   New balance: $86.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 'x'.

A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color, so we can set up the equation x/15 = 6.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 15, which gives us x = 6 * 15 = 90.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to first find Ben's age, and then multiply it by 3.

Since Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, we can find Ben's age by multiplying Chris's age by 2.

Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3.

Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for her retirement. 

First, let's calculate her annual expenses during retirement. 40% of her current annual salary is 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000.

Since she plans to live for 20 years, her total expenses during retirement will be 20 * $40,000 = $800,000.

Lauren saves 20% of her current salary, which is 0.2 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

To find out how many years she needs to work to save $800,000, we can divide the total amount needed by the amount she saves per year: $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for her retirement expenses. Since she plans to live for 20 years after retirement, we need to subtract 20 from the total number of years to find out how many more years she needs to work: 40 - 20 = 20 years.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to divide the number of boys by the percentage of boys. 

First, we convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 40% = 40/100 = 0.4

Then, we divide the number of boys by this decimal: 240 / 0.4 = 600

This means the total number of students in the school is 600. 

Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we multiply the total number of students by the percentage of girls: 600 * 0.6 = 360

"To find out how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days she has for hiking in June. June has 30 days.

Since she wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can calculate her daily target as follows:

Total miles / Total days = Daily target
9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since she plans to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, we can calculate her current daily hiking distance as follows:

Current daily hiking distance = 2 * 125 miles
Current daily hiking distance = 250 miles

Now, we can find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike to reach her target:

Additional miles per day = Daily target - Current daily hiking distance
Additional miles per day = 310 miles - 250 miles
Additional miles per day = 60 miles

Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 2 hours
Speed = 70 mph

Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours = 140 miles (one way)

Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Total distance = 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles

John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the total distance by 2:
Total monthly distance = 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles

"To solve this problem, let's first calculate the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers who work at a known rate. 

2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, so together they produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys an hour. 
2 workers produce 4 toys an hour, so together they produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys an hour. 
The total number of toys produced by these 4 workers is 12 + 8 = 20 toys an hour.

Since all 5 workers work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers is 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, and the total number of toys needed is 400. So, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Since the 4 workers produce 200 toys in 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in 10 hours is 380. To find the number of toys produced by the fifth worker, we subtract the number of toys produced by the 4 workers from the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers: 380 - 200 = 180 toys.

To find the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour, we divide the number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked: 180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour.

"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we first need to find the weight of each of his dogs. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so Elijah's first dog weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. 

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so Elijah's second dog weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

The total weight of Elijah's dogs is 15 + 30 = 45 pounds. 

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add Elijah's dogs' weight to Kory's dog's weight: 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

"To solve this problem, let's work backwards from the information given.

Kris had 7 stickers left after giving some to Rob. Kris had 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers before giving any to Rob.

Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris, and Kris had 16 stickers. This means Luis had 16 + 7 = 23 stickers before giving any to Kris.

Luis used half of the stickers and gave the rest to Kris. This means Luis had 23 stickers and gave half of them to Kris. Half of 23 is 11.5, but since you can't give half a sticker, we'll assume Luis had an even number of stickers to begin with. Let's call this number x. Then, Luis gave x/2 stickers to Kris and kept x/2 stickers for himself.

We know that Luis gave 11 stickers to Kris (since Kris had 16 stickers and Kris got 7 from Rob). This means x/2 = 11. To find x, we multiply both sides by 2, so x = 22.

Now we know Luis had 22 stickers. We also know that Luis got half of the stickers from Seth. This means Seth had 22 * 2 = 44 stickers in the beginning.

"To find the total number of M&M's, we need to multiply the number of large bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply by the number of M&M's per ounce. 

Number of large bags = 3
Weight of each bag = 10 ounces
M&M's per ounce = 30

Total M&M's = 3 * 10 * 30 = 900

Since each small bag contains 10 M&M's, we can find the total number of small bags by dividing the total M&M's by 10.

Total small bags = 900 / 10 = 90

Half of the circumference of the earth is 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km.

Since Alfie flies 400 km every day, we can find the number of days it will take him to fly 20,000 km by dividing 20,000 km by 400 km/day.

20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days.

"To find Vince's current age, we first need to find Liam's age two years ago. Since Liam is 16 now, two years ago he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince, so we can set up the equation: 14 = 2 * Vince's age two years ago.

To find Vince's age two years ago, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: Vince's age two years ago = 14 / 2 = 7.

Since Vince's age two years ago was 7, we add 2 to find his current age: Vince's current age = 7 + 2 = 9.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's call this number x.
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted y. Then, Camden painted y + 12 eggs.
3. Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we can set up the equation: y + (y + 12) = 30
4. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2y + 12 = 30
5. Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get: 2y = 18
6. Dividing both sides by 2, we get: y = 9
7. So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.
8. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and Camden painted 21 eggs, we can set up the equation: x + x = 21 + x (since Arnold and Madeline's total is equal to Camden's total)
9. However, we know that the total number of eggs painted by all four people is 56, so we can set up the equation: 2x + 30 = 56 (since Arnold and Madeline's total is x, and Camden and Sarah's total is 30)
10. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: 2x = 26
11. Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 13
12. So, Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.
13. The difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs is 21 - 13 = 8.

"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total number of boxes and the total weight of the crayons and boxes.

Since Nik has 200 crayons and each box can hold 8 crayons, we can divide 200 by 8 to find the total number of boxes: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces and there are 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is 8 * 25 = 200 ounces.

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and Nik has 200 crayons, so the total weight of the crayons is 1 * 200 = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and boxes is 200 ounces (boxes) + 200 ounces (crayons) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, we can divide 400 by 16 to find the total weight in pounds: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

First, John can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree. 
80% of 80 is 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet.

Since he cuts the tree into 4-foot logs, the number of logs he can make is 64 / 4 = 16 logs.

From each log, he cuts 5 planks, so the total number of planks is 16 * 5 = 80 planks.

He sells each plank for $1.2, so the total amount he makes is 80 * $1.2 = $96.

"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find the salary of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, and her brother earns 1/2 of what she earns. So, her brother's salary is 1/2 * $5000 = $2500.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary. The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 + $2500 = $7500. So, their mother's salary is 2 * $7500 = $15000.

Now, we add up their salaries to find the total amount of money they all have together: $5000 + $2500 + $15000 = $19600.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out Grandma's speed on the beach and on the sidewalk. 

Let's assume Grandma's speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she spends 40 minutes on the beach. 

The time it takes to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/x. The time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/(2x).

Since the total time spent on the beach is 40 minutes, we can set up the equation: 2/x = 40.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by x, which gives us 2 = 40x. Then, we can divide both sides by 40, which gives us x = 1/20.

Now that we know Grandma's speed on the beach is 1/20 miles per minute, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2(1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

The time it takes to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/(1/20) = 40 minutes. The time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/(1/10) = 10 minutes.

The total time it takes to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60:
$60 (target) - $32 (already saved) = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take:

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob originally had. 

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles and has 60 marbles, we can set up an equation to find the original number of marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 24. 

Let's denote the original number of marbles as x. The equation can be set up as follows: x + 24 = 60.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation: x = 60 - 24.

x = 36

So, Bob originally had 36 marbles. 

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 marbles. We can do this by subtracting 10 from the original number of marbles: 36 - 10 = 26.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle. 

Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the temperatures of the two mugs. 

The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle). 

The average temperature of the water in the bottle is (33 + x) / 2.

Since Donny can now drink the water, the average temperature must be at least 40 degrees. 

We can set up the inequality:

(33 + x) / 2 ≥ 40

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:

33 + x ≥ 80

Subtract 33 from both sides:

x ≥ 47

So, the second bottle must be at least 47 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens. 

In three weeks, there are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks have 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, so in 21 days, they will bring 20 * 21 = 420 cows.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day, so in 21 days, they will bring 10 * 21 = 210 chickens.

The total number of cows is 50 (initial cows) + 420 (cows from Milkie Cows Limited) = 470 cows.

The total number of chickens is 20 (initial chickens) + 210 (chickens from Broilers Limited) = 230 chickens.

The total number of animals on the farm is 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

"To find the total cost of the bagels, we need to first calculate the original cost of 4 packs of bagels. 

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs will cost 4 x $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00 to find the discount amount. 

10% of $40.00 = 0.10 x $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost to find the final cost of the bagels. 

$40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, and Russell ordered 4 packs, the total number of bagels is 9 x 4 = 36.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels.

$36.00 ÷ 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know he ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so we can write this as:

23 - 5 = 18

Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. We know it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make this, so we can write this as:

6 - 3 = 3

It takes 3 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes, which is 2 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops, we can set up a proportion:

3 potatoes / 2 scoops = x potatoes / 18 scoops

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

3 * 18 = 2x
54 = 2x
x = 54 / 2
x = 27

It takes 27 potatoes to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens:
240 eggs / 12 = 20 dozens

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to find the total number of red jellybeans. We know that there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans. 

So, the number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34.

We know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We already know the number of green and red jellybeans, so we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the number of green and red jellybeans from the total.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
= 60 - (17 + 34)
= 60 - 51
= 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the total number of lemons he gets in a year and then multiply it by 10 (since a decade has 10 years).

First, let's find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a year:
5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

Now, let's multiply the number of lemons he gets in a year by 10 to find the total number of lemons in a decade:
30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

"To find the number of women on the bus initially, we need to first find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 9 = 14. 

The fraction of the total number of passengers that are women is 9/14. 

To find the number of women on the bus initially, we multiply the fraction by the total number of passengers: (9/14) * 84 = 54.

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is 54 - 20 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first determine how many sunflowers were sold in a day and then multiply that by 3.

Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers per day. Since each sunflower costs $2, we can find the number of sunflowers sold per day by dividing the total earnings from sunflowers by the cost of each sunflower.

Number of sunflowers sold per day = Total earnings from sunflowers / Cost of each sunflower
= $26 / $2
= 13

Now, we know that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers and Faraday earned $56 from the bouquets per day. We can find the number of bouquets sold per day by dividing the total earnings from bouquets by the cost of each bouquet.

Number of bouquets sold per day = Total earnings from bouquets / Cost of each bouquet
= $56 / $8
= 7

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:
Total sunflowers in bouquets per day = Number of bouquets sold per day * Number of sunflowers per bouquet
= 7 * 12
= 84

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold per day by adding the number of sunflowers sold individually and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day:
Total sunflowers sold per day = Number of sunflowers sold per day + Total sunflowers in bouquets per day
= 13 + 84
= 97

Finally, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days by multiplying the total number of sunflowers sold per day by 3:
Total sunflowers sold in 3 days = Total sunflowers sold per day * 3
= 97 * 3
= 291

The final answer is: 291"
"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference between the two.

First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide $100 by $5:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Now, Adam sells 60% of his inventory, which is 60% of 20 rocks:

60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

Since Adam sells each rock for $7, the total revenue from selling 12 rocks is:

12 rocks * $7/rock = $84

Now, let's find the total cost of the rocks Adam bought:

20 rocks * $5/rock = $100

Since Adam only sells 12 rocks, he still has 8 rocks left, which he didn't sell. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

8 rocks * $5/rock = $40

The total cost of the rocks Adam bought is the cost of the rocks he sold plus the cost of the rocks he didn't sell:

$100 (total cost) = $84 (cost of rocks sold) + $16 (cost of rocks not sold)

However, we need to find the cost of the rocks he didn't sell to calculate the loss. The cost of the rocks he didn't sell is $40.

The total revenue is $84, and the total cost is $100. The loss is the difference between the total cost and the total revenue:

Loss = Total cost - Total revenue
Loss = $100 - $84
Loss = $16

However, this is not the correct answer because we need to consider the cost of the rocks he didn't sell. The correct loss is the cost of the rocks he didn't sell, which is $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days it takes to complete each type of picture scene. 

Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day, so to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes, it will take her 45 / 5 = 9 days.
She can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day, so to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes, it will take her 36 / 6 = 6 days.
She can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day, so to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes, it will take her 49 / 7 = 7 days.

The LCM of 9, 6, and 7 is 126. Therefore, it will take Lauren 126 days to complete all the picture scenes.

"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

First, let's convert the dozen eggs to a numerical value. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, three dozen eggs would be 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs (36) by the number of children (4). 

36 ÷ 4 = 9

So, each child receives 9 eggs."
"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total cost of food for one month. 

First, we need to determine the number of days in May. May has 31 days. 

Since each fish needs $1 worth of food a day, and Jen has 3 fish, the daily cost of food for all her fish is 3 * $1 = $3.

To find the total cost for the month of May, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

The final answer is: $93"

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

The probability of the first ticket winning is 20% or 0.2. 
The probability of the second ticket winning is three times more likely, so it's 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability of both tickets winning, we multiply the probabilities: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as x.

Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, the number of seashells Carlos collected is 2x.

We are given that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so the number of seashells Jim collected is 2x + 5.

We know that the total number of seashells collected is the sum of the seashells collected by each person: x + 2x + (2x + 5) = 5x + 5.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, we need to divide the total number of seashells by 3 (the number of people). 

So, (5x + 5) / 3 = (5/3)x + 5/3.

However, we don't know the value of x. To find the value of x, we need to use the information that Jim collected 27 seashells. We can set up the equation 2x + 5 = 27.

Solving for x, we get 2x = 22, and x = 11.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of seashells each person collected: Carrey collected x = 11, Carlos collected 2x = 22, and Jim collected 2x + 5 = 27.

To find out how many seashells each person got when they divided them equally, we divide the total number of seashells by 3: (11 + 22 + 27) / 3 = 60 / 3 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday), so the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), Mason eats 5 carrots each day, so the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 * 2 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays and the weekend: 20 + 10 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (which is the decimal form of 60%). 

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we have the lengths of both songs: 5 minutes for the first song and 8 minutes for the second song. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the profit from each day and then add them together.

On Monday, Linus bought 2 devices for $20 each, so the total cost is 2 x $20 = $40. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 x $20 = $40. So, the profit from each device is $40 - $20 = $20. Since he bought 2 devices, the total profit from Monday is 2 x $20 = $40.

On Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each, so the total cost is 4 x $20 = $80. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 x $20 = $40. So, the profit from each device is $40 - $20 = $20. Since he bought 4 devices, the total profit from Tuesday is 4 x $20 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Since each juice can cover 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of 1 person's daily energy demand, Hortex would need 100/20 = 5 bottles.

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the number of bottles it can produce from the total number of bottles required:

11500 - 4200 = 7300

The final answer is: 7300"
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Since Carla has 8 babies and 3/4 of them wear purple, the number of babies wearing purple is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

Now, 1/4 of the babies wear blue, so the number of babies wearing blue is 1/4 * 8 = 2.

The number of babies wearing blue and bows is 2. 

The number of babies wearing purple and bows is 1/3 of the purple wearers, which is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

Now, the total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of the number of babies wearing blue and bows and the number of babies wearing purple and bows, which is 2 + 2 = 4.

The percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is the number of babies wearing purple and bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, multiplied by 100. 

So, (2 / 4) * 100 = 50.

Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - (Reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)

"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. 

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. 

So far, he has sold 40 + 20 = 60 square meters. This leaves him with 80 - 60 = 20 square meters of land.

He then sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, he earned 20 * 3 = $60 from the remaining land.

To find the total amount of money he earned, we add the money from each sale: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

"To find the total number of eggs found by each person, we need to follow the given information:

1. Lamar finds 5 eggs.
2. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
3. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
4. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs found by all the people: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we need to convert 3 dozen to a numerical value. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is equal to 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to find the size of the third apartment complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so their combined size is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400.

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. Adding this to 400 gives 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

So, the total number of apartments is 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects from 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. 

We are given that R = 4B and B = Y - 7. 

We also know that R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting R = 4B into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Substituting B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37, we get 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides to get 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6 to get Y = 12.

Now that we know Y, we can find B by substituting Y = 12 into the equation B = Y - 7, which gives B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B, we can find R by substituting B = 5 into the equation R = 4B, which gives R = 4 * 5 = 20.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume Ronnie was given x dollars initially. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3x dollars.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Ronnie is left with x - y dollars and Rissa is left with 3x - y dollars, where y is the amount they each gave to their little sister.

We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

3x - y = (4/5)(3x)

To solve for y, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

15x - 5y = 12x

Now, we can isolate y by subtracting 12x from both sides:

15x - 12x - 5y = 12x - 12x
3x - 5y = 0

Now, we can add 5y to both sides:

3x = 5y

Now, we can divide both sides by 5:

(3/5)x = y

Now, we can substitute this expression for y into the equation for Ronnie's remaining money:

x - y = x - (3/5)x
x - (3/5)x = x - (3/5)x
(2/5)x = x - (3/5)x
(2/5)x = (2/5)x

Now, we can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 5:

2x = 2x

This equation is true for any value of x, but we can still solve for x by using the information that Ronnie was given $5 initially. 

x = 5

Now, we can substitute this value of x into the expression for Ronnie's remaining money:

x - y = 5 - (3/5)(5)
x - y = 5 - 3
x - y = 2

Now, we can substitute the expression for y in terms of x:

x - (3/5)x = 2
(2/5)x = 2

Now, we can multiply both sides by 5:

2x = 10

Now, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 5

Now, we can substitute this value of x into the expression for Ronnie's remaining money:

x - y = 5 - (3/5)(5)
x - y = 5 - 3
x - y = 2

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the amount of red, white, and purple paint is x. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, the total amount of these three colors is 3x.

The mural is half yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is half of the total paint used, which is 12 pints. Therefore, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, which is the sum of the red, white, purple, and yellow paint. We can write this as an equation:

3x + 6 = 12

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 12 - 6
3x = 6

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 6 / 3
x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, and then add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box for $1, we first need to find out how many pods are in the new box. 

The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. 20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. So the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with the new box for $12. Since the new box costs $12 and you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 120 cycles with the new box for $12.

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the total number of cycles by 12.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the total number of bills is 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

4. He triples his money, which means he triples the number of bills. Since each bill is $20, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. Since each bill is now worth $20, he has a total of 60 * 20 = $1200.

6. He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find the number of 5 dollar bills, we divide the total amount by 5: 1200 / 5 = 240.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team in the match. Team A scores 4 goals in the first half and 2 goals in the second half, for a total of 4 + 2 = 6 goals. Team B scores 2 goals in the first half and 8 goals in the second half, for a total of 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how many days it will take for the chalk to be smaller than 2 inches.

Initially, the teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk, which is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches. 

Now, the remaining chalk is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

The teacher will use 20% of the chalk each day. To find out how many days it will take for the chalk to be smaller than 2 inches, we can set up an equation:

2.75 - (0.20 * 2.75) * number of days = 2

Simplifying the equation:
2.75 - 0.55 * number of days = 2

Subtract 2.75 from both sides:
-0.55 * number of days = -0.75

Divide both sides by -0.55:
number of days = 1.36

Since the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of days before he has to recycle the chalk, so we round down to the nearest whole number.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to find the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4. 
One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to first determine how many face masks Mike bought, and then calculate three times that amount and add 2.

Mike bought 5 face masks. 

Three times the amount Mike bought is 3 * 5 = 15.

Adding 2 to that amount gives us 15 + 2 = 17.

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the percentage of teeth the dentist fixes, we first need to determine the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the number of teeth capped is 4 + 7 = 11. 

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15. 

To find the percentage of teeth the dentist fixes, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100. 

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the amount of milk that was returned, we need to calculate 2/5 of 4000 gallons. 

2/5 * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5
= 8000 / 5
= 1600 gallons

Since the cost of milk per gallon is $3.5, the total refund will be the cost of 1600 gallons of milk.

Refund = 1600 * $3.5
= $5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

20 = C

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many books Bob can buy in total, we need to divide the total amount of money he has ($27000) by the cost of 100 books ($500). 

Total number of books = Total money / Cost per 100 books
Total number of books = $27000 / $500
Total number of books = 54

Since Bob is distributing the books to 3 schools, we need to divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books each school will get.

Number of books per school = Total number of books / Number of schools
Number of books per school = 54 / 3
Number of books per school = 18

"Let's break down the sequence of events:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up 2 apples, put 1 in his pocket, and threw 1 back into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples.
3. He picked up the 5 new apples and put all but 1 in his pocket. So, he now has 1 apple in his pocket and 1 new apple.
4. He threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 6 new apples.

Adding up the apples in his pocket and the new apples, Newton has 1 (initially in his pocket) + 5 (new apples from the first throw) + 1 (new apple from the second throw) + 6 (new apples from the second throw) = 13 apples.

"To find the total cost of Ali's order, we need to calculate the total number of coal bags and multiply it by the cost per unit.

First, we need to find the total number of coal bags:
Total coal in kilos = 850 kg
Weight of each bag = 50 kg
Number of bags = Total coal in kilos / Weight of each bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg
= 17 bags

Now, we need to find the total cost:
Cost per unit = $18
Number of units = 17
Total cost = Cost per unit * Number of units

The final answer is: $306"
"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza that her friends will eat. 

For cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is 6 * 6 = 36. 

For pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 4 * 6 = 24.

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find out how many whole pizzas are needed for each type. 

For cheese pizza, 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas. 

For pepperoni pizza, 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, she needs a total of 3 + 3 = 6 pizzas.

"To find the total number of miles Sam ran, we need to add up the miles he ran on each day. 

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day, so that's 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 miles. 
On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day, so that's 5 + 5 = 10 miles. 

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days: 9 + 10 = 19 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many snowballs Jay builds per 15 minutes and then calculate how many 15-minute intervals it will take for him to have 60 snowballs.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. To find out how many snowballs he builds in 15 minutes, we divide 20 by 4 (since 60 minutes / 15 minutes = 4).

20 snowballs / 4 = 5 snowballs per 15 minutes

However, Jay also loses 2 snowballs every 15 minutes. So, the net gain of snowballs every 15 minutes is:

5 (built) - 2 (melted) = 3 snowballs per 15 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. We can do this by dividing 60 by the net gain of 3 snowballs per 15 minutes.

60 / 3 = 20

Since each interval is 15 minutes, we multiply the number of intervals by 15 to find the total time.

20 intervals * 15 minutes = 300 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60.

300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: 5"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the remaining bandages after the first day are x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The remaining bandages after the second day are (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they had 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The remaining bandages after the third day are (x - 16) - 25 + 100 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 59 = 78

To solve for x, we subtract 59 from both sides:

x = 19

"To find out how much Jen will receive, we need to calculate her total earnings from working hours and her attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her total working hours in April:
7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week
Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total working hours in April will be:
45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Now, let's calculate her earnings from working hours:
180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen did not incur any absences, she will receive the attendance bonus of $10 for each day. There are 6 days in a week, so for 4 weeks, she will receive:
6 days/week * 4 weeks = 24 days
24 days * $10/day = $240

Now, let's add her earnings from working hours and attendance bonus:
$270 + $240 = $510

"To find the total cost, we first need to determine the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $600 / 10 = $60 per bottle.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of the cognac is 50% more than the scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90 per bottle.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the sum of the cost of the scotch and the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let x be the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The problem states that ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8.

We are told that this expression is equal to 40, so we can set up the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes per day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day.

Since Jordan changes the remaining half of the diapers, he also changes 5 diapers per day.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total volume of the jar, we need to multiply the length, width, and height of the jar. 

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume used by the jelly beans will be 80% of the total volume. 

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of a single jelly bean.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of a single jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between his guess and the true number of red jelly beans.

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Estimated number of red jelly beans
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

The final answer is: 36"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the bus had 20 people.
2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.
3. At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop (40) entered the bus. This means 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.
4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, the bus has 200 - 180 = 20 spaces left.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for the first 5 years and the cost of visits for the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5. The annual cost is 3 * $5 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

The total cost for all visits is $30 + $45 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups required and then multiply that by the time it takes for each group to try the escape room.

There are 4 grades (4-7) with 10 students in each grade, so the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find the total number of groups required:

40 students / 8 students per group = 5 groups

Since each group uses their full 45 minutes, the total time required for everyone to try the escape room is the number of groups multiplied by the time per group:

5 groups * 45 minutes per group = 225 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we can divide by 60:

225 minutes / 60 = 3.75 hours

Therefore, it will take 3 hours and 45 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

The final answer is: 3.75"
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the tables and the total cost of the roof frames, and then add them together.

The cost of the tables is 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.
The cost of the roof frames is 2 frames * $10 per frame = $20.

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames together: $80 + $20 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece, which is 4x:

4x = 4(8) = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can multiply the total pounds of meat needed by the amount of seasoning per pound to find the total seasoning needed.

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the width of one window by the number of windows. 

Width of one window: 35 inches
Number of windows: 5

Total width of windows = 35 inches/window * 5 windows = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Fabric needed = 2 * 175 inches = 350 inches

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the total cost of the call, we need to calculate the cost for the first 16 minutes and the cost for the remaining minutes.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. 
   Let's denote the number of cupcakes as C and the number of brownies as B. 
   We can write this as B = 3C - 2.

2. Each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. 
   The total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

3. The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies. 
   We can write this as C + B = 10.

4. Substitute the expression for B from step 1 into the equation in step 3. 
   C + (3C - 2) = 10

5. Combine like terms. 
   4C - 2 = 10

"To find the total cost, first, calculate the discount on the manicure and pedicure. 

The original cost of a manicure is $35 and a pedicure is $40. The total cost of both is $35 + $40 = $75. 

A 20% discount on $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

So, the discounted cost of both manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Next, calculate the cost of nail art. There are 10 fingers, and each costs $3. So, the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them up.

1. The first 3 magazines send 12 issues a year, so the total number of issues from these magazines is 3 * 12 = 36.
2. The second magazine sends 6 issues a year.
3. The third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, let's add up the total number of issues from all magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

However, the question asks for the total number of magazines, not the total number of issues. Since each magazine sends a certain number of issues, we need to find the total number of magazines. 

We know that the first 3 magazines send 12 issues each, the second magazine sends 6 issues, and the third magazine sends 24 issues. We can set up an equation to represent the total number of issues:

12 * 3 + 6 + 24 = 66

Since we already know the total number of issues (66), we can set up an equation to represent the total number of magazines:

Let x be the number of magazines that send 24 issues. Then, the total number of magazines is 3 + 1 + x.

We know that the total number of issues is 66, so we can set up the equation:

12 * 3 + 6 + 24x = 66

Simplifying the equation, we get:

36 + 6 + 24x = 66
42 + 24x = 66

Subtracting 42 from both sides, we get:

24x = 24

Dividing both sides by 24, we get:

x = 1

So, there is 1 magazine that sends 24 issues. The total number of magazines is 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

We know that Samantha has 27 paintings. Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, Shelley must have 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.

We also know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. To find out how many paintings Kim has, we need to subtract 8 from Shelley's total. 

So, Kim has 39 - 8 = 31 paintings.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to follow the steps:

1. Calculate the price increase in December: 
   Initial price = $40
   Increase percentage = 80%
   Price increase = Initial price * (Increase percentage / 100)
   Price increase = $40 * (80 / 100)
   Price increase = $40 * 0.8
   Price increase = $32
   New price in December = Initial price + Price increase
   New price in December = $40 + $32
   New price in December = $72

2. Calculate the price decrease in January:
   New price in December = $72
   Decrease percentage = 50%
   Price decrease = New price in December * (Decrease percentage / 100)
   Price decrease = $72 * (50 / 100)
   Price decrease = $72 * 0.5
   Price decrease = $36
   New price in January = New price in December - Price decrease
   New price in January = $72 - $36
   New price in January = $36

"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the standard lessons and the veteran lessons separately, and then add them together.

For the standard lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. So, the total amount from standard lessons is:
4 * $80 = $320

For the veteran lessons, Charlie reduces his rate by 25%. This means he charges 75% of his standard rate, which is 0.75 * $80 = $60 per hour. He has 2 lessons at this rate. So, the total amount from veteran lessons is:
2 * $60 = $120

Now, we add the total amount from standard lessons and veteran lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make:
$320 + $120 = $440

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up the scores:

210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The sum of the scores is 630.

Next, we need to count the total number of scores, which is 9.

Now, we divide the sum of the scores by the total number of scores:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

The mean score is 70."
"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first determine what 1/4 of the original amount is. 

Since Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos originally, 1/4 of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5. 

This means Eve was left with 5 pomelos. 

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to subtract the number of pomelos she was left with from the original amount. 

20 (original amount) - 5 (amount left) = 15

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

"To find the number of apples Walter ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60. 

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. 

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

60 - 24 = 36

Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. 

25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. 

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. 

The amount of money he received = 27 * 3 = 81

"To find the total number of novels Regina wrote this year, we need to determine the total number of novels she wrote last year and then multiply it by 4 (since 3 quarters is equivalent to 3/4, and 4 is the reciprocal of 3/4).

Let's start by setting up the equation:

9 novels = 3/4 * x

To find x, we can multiply both sides by 4/3:

9 * (4/3) = x
12 = x

So, Regina wrote 12 novels this year."
"To find the distance covered by Michael in 3 days, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in 3 days at an average speed of 50 km/hr.

First, we need to convert the time from days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3 days is equal to 3 x 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total distance traveled by multiplying the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 50 km/hr x 72 hr
Distance = 3600 km

Now, we can find the percentage of the distance covered by dividing the distance traveled by the total distance and multiplying by 100:

Percentage = (Distance traveled / Total distance) x 100
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) x 100
Percentage = 0.6 x 100
Percentage = 60%

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.
3. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.
4. The remaining grapes are used by their mother to make pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the number of pies she can make is 36 / 12 = 3 pies.
5. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used by their mother is 3 * 12 = 36 grapes.
6. The initial number of grapes is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother: 6 + 30 + 36 = 72 grapes.

"To find the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to calculate the cost of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese.

The cost of the pasta is $1.00 per box. Since Bud makes it once a week, he buys 52 boxes in a year (52 weeks). The total cost of the pasta is 52 * $1.00 = $52.00.

The cost of the cheddar cheese is $3.00. Since Bud makes it once a week, he buys 52 blocks in a year. The total cost of the cheddar cheese is 52 * $3.00 = $156.00.

The cost of the gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00. Since Bud makes it once a week, he buys 52 blocks in a year. The total cost of the gruyere cheese is 52 * $6.00 = $312.00.

The total cost of making macaroni and cheese is the sum of the cost of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese: $52.00 + $156.00 + $312.00 = $520.00.

"To find the total number of classrooms the custodian needs to clean, we already know that number is 80. 

The total time they have to clean is 5 days. Since they work 8 hours a day, the total time they have to clean is 5 days * 8 hours/day = 40 hours.

The total time it takes to clean all the classrooms is 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes. 

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours.

Now, we can find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms by dividing the time spent cleaning by the total time available and multiplying by 100: (20 hours / 40 hours) * 100 = 50%.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of books the middle shelves can hold as 'x'. Since there are two middle shelves, the total number of books they can hold is 2x.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2x books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 2x - 5 books.

The total number of books the bookcase can hold is the sum of the books on all shelves: 2x + 2x + 2x - 5 = 6x - 5.

We know that Elly has 110 books, so the total number of books the bookcase can hold must be at least 110. 

6x - 5 ≥ 110

To find the minimum number of bookcases needed, we need to find the smallest integer value of x that satisfies this inequality.

6x - 5 ≥ 110
6x ≥ 115
x ≥ 115 / 6
x ≥ 19.17

Since x must be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a shelf), the smallest possible value of x is 20.

Now, let's find the total number of books the bookcase can hold when x = 20:
6x - 5 = 6(20) - 5 = 120 - 5 = 115

Since 115 is less than 110, we need to increase x to 21:
6x - 5 = 6(21) - 5 = 126 - 5 = 121

Now, 121 is greater than 110, so the bookcase with x = 21 can hold all 110 books.

However, we need to find the minimum number of bookcases needed. Since each bookcase has 3 shelves, we need to divide 110 by 3 to find the minimum number of bookcases needed to hold all the books, but we must round up to the nearest whole number because you can't have a fraction of a bookcase.

110 / 3 = 36.67
Rounded up to the nearest whole number, the minimum number of bookcases needed is 37.

However, we know that a bookcase with x = 21 can hold all 110 books. Since each bookcase has 3 shelves, we can divide 110 by 3 to find the minimum number of bookcases needed to hold all the books, but we must round up to the nearest whole number because you can't have a fraction of a bookcase.

110 / 3 = 36.67
Rounded up to the nearest whole number, the minimum number of bookcases needed is 37.

But we also know that a bookcase with x = 20 can hold 115 books, which is more than 110. So, we can use 2 bookcases with x = 20 to hold all 110 books.

2 * 3 = 6 shelves
2 * 115 = 230 books

Since 230 is greater than 110, we can use 2 bookcases with x = 20 to hold all 110 books.

Next, let's find the total number of eggs. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, 5 dozens will be:
5 * 12 = 60 eggs

Now, let's find the total selling price. Rose will sell 3 eggs for $1, so the selling price for 60 eggs will be:
60 / 3 * $1 = $20

Now, let's calculate the profit:
Profit = Total Selling Price - Total Cost Price
Profit = $20 - $12

"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to get right to pass the two tests. 

Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct, and the total number of questions is the sum of the questions in both tests, we need to calculate the total number of questions first. The first test has 70 questions and the second test has 40 questions, so the total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110.

Now, we can calculate the total number of questions she needs to get right to pass the two tests. 70% of 110 is 0.7 * 110 = 77.

Next, we need to find out how many questions she got right on the first test. She got 60% of 70 questions correct, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42.

Now, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get right to pass the two tests. 77 - 42 = 35.

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know S, we can find B: B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, which is 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, which is 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles. 

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to first find the total number of chips. Since Mitchell buys two bags of chips with 55 chips each, we multiply the number of chips in one bag by 2.

Total number of chips = 55 * 2 = 110

Since there are 5 family members, we divide the total number of chips by 5 to find out how many chips each person gets.

Chips per person = Total number of chips / Number of family members
= 110 / 5
= 22

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to add up the time it takes for each side. 

The first side takes 5 minutes. 
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each. 
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides: 
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes for Phineas to cover the distance on land and in water separately, and then add them together.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, Phineas needs to cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

Time taken to cover 100 yards on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes

Time taken to cover 100 yards in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes

Total time taken = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

The final answer is: $60"

"To find the new speaking speed of John, we need to multiply his original speed by 2.5. 

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can convert the new speed to words per second by dividing by 60.

New speed (words per second) = 375 WPM / 60 = 6.25 words per second

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. 

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words per page = 4500 words

To find the time it takes to speak 4500 words, we can divide the total number of words by the new speaking speed in words per second.

Time = Total words / New speed (words per second) = 4500 words / 6.25 words per second = 720 seconds

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we can convert the time to minutes by dividing by 60.

Time (minutes) = 720 seconds / 60 = 12 minutes

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining days.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.
On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so 50 + 20 = 70 people.
On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so 2 * 70 = 140 people.

The total number of people Conor saw on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240 people.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500 people.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 1.5 minutes is 20 + 60 = 80.
4. In the next 30 seconds, the kernels pop at four times the initial rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.
5. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 2 minutes is 80 + 80 = 160.
6. In the final 30 seconds, the kernels pop at half the rate of the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.
7. So, the total number of kernels popped in 2.5 minutes is 160 + 40 = 200.
8. After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.
9. Therefore, the total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210.

"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade he needs to make, including the extra gallon for Allen. 

Since Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade and 1 extra gallon, he will need to make a total of 5 gallons. 

Since 1 cup of lemon juice is needed for 1 gallon of lemonade, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total amount of lemons needed for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

5 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 5 cups of lemon juice needed
Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of lemons needed:
5 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 30 lemons

However, the extra gallon of lemonade for Allen needs to be twice as tart as the other gallons. This means it needs to have twice the amount of lemon juice. 

So, for the extra gallon, we need 2 cups of lemon juice. 
For the other 4 gallons, we need 4 cups of lemon juice. 
Total lemon juice needed is 2 cups + 4 cups = 6 cups.

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of lemons needed:
6 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 36 lemons

Therefore, Tim will need 36 lemons in total.

Value after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Depreciation in the second year = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Depreciation in the third year = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after the third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."

For the T-shirts, Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a buy one get one 50% off deal. This means that the price of one T-shirt is 100% and the price of the other T-shirt is 50% of the original price. 

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. 
The price of the first T-shirt is $8.
The price of the second T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is 0.5 * $8 = $4.

The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

For the shoes, the original price is $40 and they are 40% off. 
The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 * $40 = $16.

The price of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is the cost of the T-shirts plus the cost of the shoes, which is $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his total earnings from doing chores and subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 per week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are 6 * 3 = $18.

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each, so the total cost is 4 * 1.25 = $5.

Now, let's subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his total earnings: 18 - 5 = $13.

To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to divide his remaining money by the cost of a movie ticket: 13 / 6.50 = 2.

"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the cost of making one jar of the mixture and then multiply it by 10.

The cost of making one jar of the mixture is:
- 2 pounds of passion fruit: 2 * $6 = $12
- 1.5 pounds of jackfruit: 1.5 * $8 = $12
- 2 pounds of honey: 2 * $10 = $20
Total cost: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

The selling price of one jar is $50. 

The profit from selling one jar is $50 - $44 = $6.

To find the profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit from one jar by 10:
$6 * 10 = $60

"To find out how many cookies Randy has now, we need to calculate the total number of cookies he had initially and then subtract the cookies he ate or gave away, and add the cookies he baked.

Initially, Randy had 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. 

Total initial cookies = 9 + 4 + 5 = 18

Randy ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. 
So, he ate 3 cookies in total.

Randy ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch.

Randy gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends.

Randy baked 4 of each flavor for dinner. 
So, he baked 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies Randy has now:
Total initial cookies - cookies eaten or given away + cookies baked = 18 - 3 - 2 - 2 + 12

"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get for the first half of the collection and the second half separately, and then add them together.

Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, we can divide them into two equal halves: 6 toy soldiers for the first half and 6 toy soldiers for the second half.

For the first half, Matthew would get $5 per toy, so the total amount for the first half would be 6 * $5 = $30.

For the second half, Matthew would get $7 per toy, so the total amount for the second half would be 6 * $7 = $42.

To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we add the amounts for the first and second halves together: $30 + $42 = $72.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then determine how many holes Nate fills in per day. 

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled in per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes.

To find out how many days it takes to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled in per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of days by 7 to find the number of weeks: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Number of chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)

"Let's break down the information given:

- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested (16), so he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
- He gathered two more Petri dishes than requested (14), so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
- He gathered the correct number of beakers (7).
- The total number of items on the lab bench is 29.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

8 (test tubes) + 7 (beakers) + 16 (Petri dishes) + x (lost beakers) = 29

Combine the known quantities:
8 + 7 + 16 = 31

Now, subtract 31 from both sides of the equation to isolate x:
31 + x = 29
x = 29 - 31
x = -2

However, since we can't have a negative number of lost beakers, this means that Igor didn't lose any beakers. The correct interpretation is that the equation is not balanced, and the correct number of beakers should be 29 - 8 - 16 = 5. 

So, the correct number of beakers Igor had initially is 7, and the correct number of items on the lab bench is 8 + 7 + 16 = 31. Since the total number of items on the lab bench is 29, Igor must have lost 31 - 29 = 2 beakers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume Aaron's speed is A miles per minute and Vanessa's speed is V miles per minute. We know that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, so A = 2V.

We also know that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, so if Vanessa runs 4 miles, Aaron runs 2 miles.

Since Aaron runs 2 miles in 16 minutes, his speed is 2 miles / 16 minutes = 1/8 miles per minute. 

Since A = 2V, we can substitute 1/8 for A and get 1/8 = 2V. To find V, we divide both sides by 2, so V = 1/16 miles per minute.

Now that we know Vanessa's speed, we can find the time it took her to run 4 miles. Time = Distance / Speed. So, time = 4 miles / (1/16 miles per minute) = 4 * 16 = 64 minutes.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line

Since he already has 6 feet of new line, we need to subtract this from the total amount of line required.

600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."

"To find the cost of each watermelon, we first need to find the total selling price of all the watermelons. 

The profit percentage is 25%, which means the selling price is 125% of the cost price (100% + 25% profit). 

The cost price of 50 watermelons is $80. 

Let's find the total selling price: 
Total selling price = Cost price + Profit
Total selling price = $80 + (25% of $80)
Total selling price = $80 + (0.25 * $80)
Total selling price = $80 + $20
Total selling price = $100

Now, we know the total selling price of 50 watermelons is $100. 

To find the cost of each watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
Cost of each watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
Cost of each watermelon = $100 / 50
Cost of each watermelon = $2

"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then determine the age of John's youngest son.

First, let's find James' current age. Since James is twice as old as Dora, and Dora will be 12 in 3 years, Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years. Therefore, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

Since James is 18 years old now and John had him when he was 19, John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son's current age is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor cost.

The original cost of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, so he pays 20% of the original cost. 
20% of $400 = 0.2 * $400 = $80

The labor cost is $50 per hour for 3 hours, so the total labor cost is:
$50 * 3 = $150

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the radiator and the labor cost:
$80 + $150 = $230

"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so C + W = 20.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. Therefore, we can write the equation: 2C + 4W = 70.

We can solve this system of equations by substituting the first equation into the second one. From the first equation, we get W = 20 - C. Substituting this into the second equation, we get 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 2C + 80 - 4C = 70. Combining like terms, we get -2C + 80 = 70. Subtracting 80 from both sides, we get -2C = -10. Dividing both sides by -2, we get C = 5.

Therefore, the number of chickens is 5.
